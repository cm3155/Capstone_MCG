 Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Bank of America Corporation (the &#8220;Corporation&#8221;) and its management may make certain statements that constitute &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;targets,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;hopes,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221; &#8220;intends,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;goals,&#8221; &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;continue&#8221; and other similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;might,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;would&#8221; and &#8220;could.&#8221; Forward-looking statements represent the Corporation&#8217;s current expectations, plans or forecasts of its future results, revenues, provision for credit losses, expenses, efficiency ratio, capital measures, strategy, and future business and economic conditions more generally, and other future matters.

Executive Summary 

Business Overview 

The Corporation is a Delaware corporation, a bank holding company (BHC) and a financial holding company. When used in this report, &#8220;the Corporation,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; may refer to Bank of America Corporation individually, Bank of America Corporation and its subsidiaries, or certain of Bank of America Corporation&#8217;s subsidiaries or affiliates.

Recent Developments 

Capital Management 

In June 2020, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) notified BHCs of their 2020 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) supervisory stress test results, which included a preliminary stress capital buffer (SCB) that was finalized in August 2020. Based on our results, we are subject to a 2.5 percent SCB for the period beginning October 1, 2020 and ending on September 30, 2021. 

Due to economic uncertainty resulting from the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the Federal Reserve required all large banks to suspend share repurchase programs in the third quarter of 2020, except for repurchases to offset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans, and to limit dividends to existing rates that do not exceed the average of the last four quarters&#8217; net income. In September 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that these measures would remain in place for the fourth quarter of 2020. Large banks will also be required to resubmit and update their capital plans in November 

2020 based on the Federal Reserve&#8217;s updated supervisory stress test scenarios. The Federal Reserve announced that they will publish the results of the additional supervisory stress tests by December 31, 2020. 

On October 21, 2020, the Board of Directors (the Board) declared a quarterly common stock dividend at the current rate of $0.18 per share. We intend to maintain the quarterly common stock dividend at this rate until further notice, subject to approval by the Board. For more information on our capital resources, see Capital Management on page 23. 

COVID-19 Pandemic 

As previously disclosed, in the first quarter of 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. In an attempt to contain the spread and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and limitations on business activity have been implemented. Additionally, there has been a decline in global economic activity, reduced U.S. and global economic output and a deterioration in macroeconomic conditions in the U.S. and globally. This has resulted in, among other things, high rates of unemployment and underemployment and caused volatility and disruptions in the global financial markets, including the energy and commodity markets. Although some restrictive measures have been eased in certain areas, businesses, market participants, our counterparties and clients, and the U.S. and global economies have been negatively impacted and are likely to be so for an extended period of time, as there remains significant uncertainty about the timing and strength of an economic recovery. 

In response to the pandemic, the Corporation has implemented protocols and processes to execute its business continuity plans and help protect its employees and support its clients. The Corporation is managing its response to the COVID-19 pandemic according to its Enterprise Response Framework, which invokes centralized management of the crisis event and the integration of its response. The CEO and key members of the Corporation&#8217;s management team meet regularly with co-leaders of the Executive Response Team, which is composed of senior executives across the Corporation, to help drive decisions, communications and consistency of response across all businesses and functions. We are also coordinating with global, regional and local authorities and health experts, including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization. 

Additionally, we have implemented a number of measures to assist our employees, clients and the communities we serve as discussed below. 

Employees 

We are providing support to our teammates to help promote the health and safety of our employees by monitoring guidance from the CDC, medical boards and health authorities and sharing such guidance with our employees. We are also operating our businesses from remote locations and leveraging our business continuity plans and capabilities. 

The Corporation has globally implemented a work-from-home posture, which has resulted in the substantial majority of our employees working from home, and pre-planned contingency strategies for site-based operations for our remaining employees. We continue to evaluate our continuity plans and work-from-home strategy in an effort to best protect the health and safety of our employees. 

3 Bank of America 

Clients 

We continue to leverage our business continuity plans and capabilities to service our clients and meet our clients&#8217; financial needs by offering assistance to clients affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and providing access to credit and the important financial services on which our clients rely. We are also participating in the programs created by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES Act) and Federal Reserve lending programs for businesses, such as the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and Main Street Lending Program, as well as other measures. While most of our deferral programs expired in the third quarter of 2020, we continue to offer assistance on a case-by-case basis when requested by clients affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

As of September 30 2020, we had approximately 343,000 PPP loans outstanding with balances totaling $24.7 billion, which were recorded in the Consumer , GWIM and Global Banking segments. In addition, we have begun to process applications for forgiveness. For more information on PPP loans, see Credit Risk Management on page 31, and for more information on accounting for PPP loans and loan modifications under the CARES Act, see Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Community Partners 

We continue to support the communities where we live and work by engaging in various initiatives to help those affected by COVID-19. These initiatives include committing resources to provide medical supplies, food and other necessities for those in need. We are also supporting racial equality, economic opportunity and environmental sustainability through direct equity investments in minority-owned depository institutions, equity investments in minority entrepreneurs, businesses and funds, as well as other initiatives. 

Risk Management 

We continue to manage the increased operational risk related to the execution of our business continuity plans in accordance with our Enterprise Response Framework, Risk Framework and Operational Risk Management Program. For more information, see Managing Risk on page 23. 

Loan Modifications 

The Corporation has implemented various consumer and commercial loan modification programs to provide its borrowers relief from the economic impacts of COVID-19. Based on guidance in the CARES Act that the Corporation adopted, COVID-19 related modifications to consumer and commercial loans that were current as of December 31, 2019 are exempt from troubled debt restructuring (TDR) classification under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). In addition, the bank regulatory agencies issued interagency guidance stating that COVID-19 related short-term modifications (i.e., six months or less) granted to consumer or commercial loans that were current as of the loan modification program implementation date are not TDRs. For more information, see Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 5 &#8211; Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements . 

We have provided borrowers with relief from the economic impacts of COVID-19 through payment deferral and forbearance programs. A significant portion of deferrals expired in the third quarter of 2020, reflecting a decline in customer requests for assistance. 

As of October 21, 2020, deferred consumer and small business loans recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet totaled $9.8 billion, consisting of $9.0 billion of residential mortgage and home equity loans, including loans serviced by others, that are well-collateralized, $298 million of consumer credit card loans and $582 million of small business and consumer vehicle loans. For deferred residential mortgage and home equity loans, the weighted average loan-to-value (LTV) and combined LTV (CLTV) ratios were 61 percent and 57 percent, respectively. Of the consumer credit card loans for which payment deferral programs have expired, 91 percent of cardholders have made at least one payment since exiting deferral. 

As of October 21, 2020, excluding small business, deferred commercial balances totaled $1.4 billion, or 0.29 percent of total commercial loans. 

Other Related Matters 

Although the macroeconomic outlook improved modestly in the three months ended September 30, 2020, the future direct and indirect impact of COVID-19 on our businesses, results of operations and financial condition of the Corporation remain highly uncertain. Should current economic conditions persist or deteriorate, this macroeconomic environment will have a continued adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. For more information on how the risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition, see Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors on page 105. 

LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rates 

As previously disclosed, to facilitate an orderly transition from Interbank Offered Rates (IBORs) and other benchmark rates to alternative reference rates (ARRs), the Corporation has established an enterprise-wide program to identify, assess and monitor risks associated with the expected discontinuation or unavailability of benchmarks, including the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). As part of this program, the Corporation continues to identify, assess and monitor risks associated with the expected discontinuation or unavailability of LIBOR and other benchmarks. Additionally, the Corporation continues to evaluate and address documentation and contractual mechanics of outstanding IBOR-based products and contracts that may mature after LIBOR is no longer deemed a representative benchmark, as well as new and potential future ARR-based products and contracts to achieve operational readiness. 

This program, which is led by the Corporation's Chief Operating Officer, includes active involvement of senior management and regular reports to the Enterprise Risk Committee. The program is structured to address the Corporation's industry and regulatory engagement, client and financial contract changes, internal and external communications, technology and operations modifications, introduction of new products, migration of existing clients, and program strategy and governance. 

As the markets for ARRs continue to grow, the Corporation continues to monitor and participate in the development and usage of ARRs, including the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) and the Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA). The Corporation issued debt and deposits linked to SOFR and SONIA, facilitated debt issuances by clients linked to SOFR and SONIA, and executed SOFR- and SONIA-based derivative contracts to make markets and facilitate client activities. 

Bank of America 4 

In accordance with the industry-wide transition from IBORs to ARRs, central clearing counterparties (CCPs) in Europe and the U.S., which act as intermediaries and require collateral deposits for the clearing and settlement of interest rate swap products and other derivatives, changed the interest rate used to calculate amounts due to counterparties for collateral deposits posted with them from the European Overnight Index Average (EONIA) to the Euro Short-Term Rate (ESTR) and the Effective Fed Funds Rate (EFFR) to SOFR in July and October 2020, respectively. In connection with this transition, the Corporation updated its operational models, systems, procedures and internal infrastructure. The earnings impact from the changes in net valuations of these derivatives was not significant at the point of conversion, as the Corporation either provided or received compensation to/from the CCPs. Additionally, in October 2020, the Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries adhered to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol, effective January 25, 2021, which provides a mechanism to enable market participants to incorporate fallbacks for certain legacy non-cleared derivatives linked to certain IBORs. 

The Corporation continues to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on the market and industry transition to ARRs, including the readiness of impacted clients and their operational readiness to transition to ARRs. For more information on the expected replacement of LIBOR and other benchmark rates, see 

Executive Summary - Recent Developments - LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rates in the MD&#38;A and Item 1A. Risk Factors - Other of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more information about the Corporation's risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic, see Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors on page 105. 

Merchant Services Joint Venture 

Prior to July 1, 2020, a significant portion of our merchant processing activity was performed by a joint venture in which we held a 49 percent ownership interest. Effective July 1, 2020, the Corporation received its share of the joint venture's merchant contracts and began performing merchant processing services for these merchants. The Corporation records merchant revenue in card income with the related costs in noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income. For more information, see Note 10 &#8211; Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Financial Highlights 

Effective January 1, 2020, we adopted the new accounting standard on current expected credit losses (CECL), under which the allowance is measured based on management&#8217;s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses (ECL). Prior-year periods presented reflect measurement of the allowance based on management&#8217;s estimate of probable incurred credit losses. For more information, see Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

5 Bank of America 

Net income was $4.9 billion and $12.4 billion, or $0.51 and $1.28 per diluted share, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $5.8 billion and $20.4 billion, or $0.56 and $2.01 per diluted share, for the same periods in 2019. The decline in net income was primarily due to higher provision for credit losses driven by the weaker economic outlook related to COVID-19 and lower net interest income, partially offset by a $2.1 billion pretax impairment charge related to the notice of the termination of the merchant services joint venture in the prior year. 

Total assets increased $304.4 billion from December 31, 2019 to $2.7 trillion primarily driven by an increase in cash and cash equivalents, debt securities and federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell primarily due to cash deployed from higher deposit balances. The increase in assets was partially offset by lower loans and leases primarily driven by a decline in credit card originations and promotional balances, mortgage paydowns and lower origination volumes. 

Total liabilities increased $300.3 billion from December 31, 2019 to $2.5 trillion primarily driven by higher deposit inflows resulting from government stimulus actions and client responses to market volatility as clients improved their liquidity positions. The increase in liabilities was also due to higher federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase primarily due to higher inventory in Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC) within Global Markets. Long-term debt also increased primarily driven by 

valuations due to lower interest rates, as well as debt issuances. 

Shareholders&#8217; equity increased $4.0 billion from December 31, 2019 primarily due to net income and market value increases on debt securities, partially offset by returns of capital to shareholders through common stock repurchases and common and preferred stock dividends as well as the impact of the adoption of the new credit loss accounting standard. 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income decreased $2.1 billion to $10.1 billion, and $3.6 billion to $33.1 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. Net interest yield on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis decreased 69 basis points (bps) to 1.72 percent, and 49 bps to 1.96 percent for the same periods. The decrease in net interest income was primarily driven by lower interest rates, partially offset by reduced deposit and funding costs, the deployment of excess deposits into securities and an additional day of interest accrual. We expect net interest income to remain relatively flat or to modestly increase in the fourth quarter of 2020 as compared to the third quarter of 2020 assuming economic conditions do not deteriorate and interest rates remain stable as compared to September 30, 2020. For more information on net interest yield and the FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 8, and for more information on interest rate risk management, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 48. 

Noninterest Income 

Table 2 Noninterest Income Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2020 2019 Fees and commissions: Card income $ 1,568 &#160; $ 1,465 $ 4,089 &#160; $ 4,286 Service charges 1,817 &#160; 1,975 5,282 &#160; 5,717 Investment and brokerage services 3,623 &#160; 3,494 10,803 &#160; 10,324 Investment banking fees 1,769 &#160; 1,533 5,316 &#160; 4,168 Total fees and commissions 8,777 &#160; 8,467 25,490 &#160; 24,495 Market making and similar activities 1,689 &#160; 2,118 6,983 &#160; 7,267 Other income (259) 35 (151) 382 Total noninterest income $ 10,207 &#160; $ 10,620 $ 32,322 &#160; $ 32,144 

Noninterest income decreased $413 million to $10.2 billion and increased $178 million to $32.3 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. The following highlights the significant changes. 

&#9679; &#160; Card income increased $103 million for the three-month period and decreased $197 million for the nine-month period. The increase in the three-month period was primarily driven by higher income related to the processing of unemployment insurance and higher merchant processing, partially offset by lower client activity related to the impact of COVID-19. The decrease in the nine-month period was primarily due to lower levels of consumer spending driven by the impact of COVID-19. 

&#9679; Service charges decreased $158 million and $435 million primarily due to higher deposit balances and lower client activity due to the impact of COVID-19. 

&#9679; Investment and brokerage services income increased $129 million and $479 million primarily due to higher client transactional activity, higher market valuations and assets 

under management (AUM) flows, partially offset by declines in AUM pricing. 

&#9679; &#160; Investment banking fees increased $236 million and $1.1 billion primarily due to higher equity underwriting fees and for the nine-month period, higher debt underwriting fees, as well. 

&#9679; Market making and similar activities decreased $429 million and $284 million. The decrease in both periods was primarily due to the impact of lower U.S. interest rates on certain risk management derivatives. The decrease in the nine-month period was also partially offset by increased client activity and strong trading performance in FICC. 

&#9679; &#160; Other income decreased $294 million and $533 million. The decrease in the three-month period was primarily due to higher partnership losses on tax credit investments, primarily affordable housing and renewable energy, as well as loan sales in the prior period. The decrease in the nine-month period was primarily due to lower equity investment income and higher partnership losses on tax credit investments. 

Bank of America 6 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses increased $610 million to $1.4 billion, and $8.6 billion to $11.3 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 primarily driven by higher ECL due to a weaker economic outlook related to COVID-19.

Table 3 Noninterest Expense Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2020 2019 Compensation and benefits $ 8,200 &#160; $ 7,779 $ 24,535 &#160; $ 24,000 Occupancy and equipment 1,798 &#160; 1,663 5,302 &#160; 4,908 Information processing and communications 1,333 &#160; 1,163 3,807 &#160; 3,484 Product delivery and transaction related 930 &#160; 696 2,518 &#160; 2,067 Marketing 308 &#160; 440 1,238 &#160; 1,410 Professional fees 450 &#160; 386 1,206 &#160; 1,155 Other general operating 1,382 &#160; 3,042 2,680 &#160; 4,637 Total noninterest expense $ 14,401 &#160; $ 15,169 $ 41,286 &#160; $ 41,661 

Noninterest expense decreased $768 million to $14.4 billion, and $375 million to $41.3 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a $2.1 billion pretax impairment charge related to the notice of termination of the merchant services joint venture recorded in the prior-year 

periods, partially offset by the impact of COVID-19 related expense, as well as higher litigation expense. Absent unexpected changes, we expect noninterest expense will be approximately $13.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020 assuming both lower COVID-19 related costs and litigation expense. 

Income Tax Expense 

Table 4 Income Tax Expense Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 (Dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2020 2019 Income before income taxes $ 4,546 &#160; $ 6,859 $ 12,876 &#160; $ 24,585 Income tax expense (335) 1,082 452 &#160; 4,149 Effective tax rate (7.4) % 15.8 % 3.5 &#160; % 16.9 % 

The changes in the effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same periods a year ago were driven by the impact of our recurring tax preference benefits on the lower levels of pretax income and the impact of the U.K. tax law change discussed below. Our recurring tax preference benefits primarily consist of tax credits from investments in affordable housing and renewable energy, aligning with our responsible growth strategy to address global sustainability challenges. We expect the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2020 to be approximately 10 percent, excluding unusual items. Absent these tax credits, the effective tax rate would be approximately 26 percent. 

On July 22, 2020, the U.K. enacted a reversal of the final two percent of scheduled decreases in the U.K. corporation tax rate, which had been previously enacted. This change will unfavorably affect income tax expense on future U.K. earnings, and requires a reversal of the adjustment to the U.K. net deferred tax assets recognized at the time the related tax rate decrease was originally enacted. Accordingly, during the third quarter of 2020, the Corporation recorded a positive income tax adjustment of approximately $700 million along with a corresponding increase to the U.K. net deferred tax assets.

Supplemental Financial Data 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

In this Form 10-Q, we present certain non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items or otherwise include components that differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are provided as additional useful information to assess our financial condition, results of operations (including period-to-period operating performance) or compliance with prospective regulatory requirements. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may not be defined or calculated the same way as non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. 

We view net interest income and related ratios and analyses on an FTE basis, which when presented on a consolidated basis are non-GAAP financial measures. To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 21 percent and a representative state tax rate. Net interest yield, which measures the basis points we earn over the cost of funds, utilizes net interest income on an FTE basis. We believe that presentation of these items on an FTE basis allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practices. 

We may present certain key performance indicators and ratios excluding certain items (e.g., debit valuation adjustment (DVA) gains (losses)) which result in non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that the presentation of measures that exclude these items is useful because such measures provide additional information to assess the underlying operational performance and trends of our businesses and to allow better comparison of period-to-period operating performance. 

We also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible equity represents shareholders&#8217; equity or common shareholders&#8217; equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)), net of related deferred tax liabilities ("adjusted" shareholders' equity or common shareholders' equity). These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models use both return on average tangible 

common shareholders&#8217; equity and return on average tangible shareholders&#8217; equity as key measures to support our overall growth objectives. These ratios are as follows: 

&#9679; Return on average tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity measures our net income applicable to common shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average common shareholders&#8217; equity. The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders&#8217; equity divided by total tangible assets. 

&#9679; Return on average tangible shareholders' equity measures our net income as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders&#8217; equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders&#8217; equity divided by total tangible assets. 

&#9679; Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders&#8217; equity divided by ending common shares outstanding. 

We believe ratios utilizing tangible equity provide additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. Tangible book value per common share provides additional useful information about the level of tangible assets in relation to outstanding shares of common stock. 

The aforementioned supplemental data and performance measures are presented in Tables 5 and 6. 

For more information on the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 51. 

Key Performance Indicators 

We present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance indicators (key performance indicators) that management uses when assessing our consolidated and/or segment results. We believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information about our underlying operational performance and trends. These key performance indicators (KPIs) may not be defined or calculated in the same way as similar KPIs used by other companies. For information on how these metrics are defined, see Key Metrics on page 104. 

Our consolidated key performance indicators, which include various equity and credit metrics, are presented in Table 1 on page 5 and/or Table 5 on page 9. 

For information on key segment performance metrics, see Business Segment Operations on page 12.

Business Segment Operations 

Segment Description and Basis of Presentation 

We report our results of operations through four business segments: Consumer Banking, GWIM, Global Banking and Global Markets , with the remaining operations recorded in All Other . We manage our segments and report their results on an FTE basis. For more information, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

We periodically review capital allocated to our businesses and allocate capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes. We utilize a methodology that considers the effect of regulatory capital requirements in addition to internal risk-based capital models. Our internal risk-based capital models use a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segment&#8217;s credit, market, interest rate, business and operational risk components. For more information on the nature of these risks, see Managing Risk on page 23. The 

capital allocated to the business segments is referred to as allocated capital. Allocated equity in the reporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital for the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the reporting unit. For more information, see Note 7 &#8211; Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

For more information on our presentation of financial information on an FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 8, and for reconciliations to consolidated total revenue, net income and period-end total assets, see Note 17 &#8211; Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Key Performance Indicators 

We present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance indicators that management uses when evaluating segment results. We believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information about our segments&#8217; operational performance, customer trends and business growth.

Consumer Banking Results 

Three-Month Comparison 

Net income for Consumer Banking decreased $1.3 billion to $2.1 billion primarily due to lower revenue and higher noninterest expense, partially offset by lower provision for credit losses. 

Net interest income decreased $1.1 billion to $5.9 billion primarily due to lower interest rates, partially offset by the benefit of higher deposit and loan balances. Noninterest income decreased $544 million to $2.1 billion driven by a decline in service charges primarily due to higher deposit balances and lower card income due to decreased client activity, as well as lower other income due to the allocation of asset and liability management (ALM) results. 

The provision for credit losses decreased $438 million to $479 million primarily driven by a release in reserves due to an improved macroeconomic outlook and lower credit card balances. 

Noninterest expense increased $443 million to $4.8 billion primarily driven by incremental expense to support customers and employees during COVID-19, as well as the cost of increased client activity and continued investments for business growth, including the merchant services platform. 

The return on average allocated capital was 21 percent, down from 36 percent, driven by lower net income, and to a lesser extent, an increase in allocated capital. For information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 12. 

Nine-Month Comparison 

Net income for Consumer Banking decreased $5.9 billion to $3.9 billion primarily due to lower revenue and a higher provision for credit losses. 

Net interest income decreased $2.5 billion to $18.7 billion and noninterest income decreased $1.5 billion to $6.3 billion. The declines were primarily driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion. 

The provision for credit losses increased $2.9 billion to $5.8 billion primarily due to the weaker economic outlook related to COVID-19. Noninterest expense increased $893 million to $14.1 billion primarily driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion. 

The return on average allocated capital was 14 percent, down from 36 percent, driven by lower net income and, to a lesser extent, an increase in allocated capital.

Deposits 

Three-Month Comparison 

Net income for Deposits decreased $1.2 billion to $880 million primarily driven by lower revenue. Net interest income declined $952 million to $3.2 billion primarily due to lower interest rates, partially offset by the benefit of growth in deposits. Noninterest income decreased $401 million to $918 million. The decline in noninterest income was primarily driven by lower service charges due to higher deposit balances and lower client activity related to the impact of COVID-19, as well as lower other income due to the allocation of ALM results. 

The provision for credit losses decreased $25 million to $59 million. Noninterest expense increased $274 million to $2.9 billion driven by continued investments in the business and incremental expense to support customers and employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Average deposits increased $149.8 billion to $853.5 billion. The increase was driven by strong organic growth of $101.7 billion in checking and time deposits and $47.7 billion in traditional savings and money market savings.

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, total risk-adjusted margin increased 121 bps and 52 bps compared to the same periods in 2019 primarily due to a decrease in the proportion of customers who pay their balances in full each month. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, total credit card purchase volumes declined $7.0 billion to $64.1 billion, and $22.0 billion to $182.1 billion compared to the same periods in 2019. The declines in credit card purchase volumes were driven by the 

impact of COVID-19. While overall spending improved during the third quarter of 2020, spending for travel and entertainment remained lower compared to the same periods a year ago. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, debit card purchase volumes increased $11.1 billion to $102.0 billion and $13.0 billion to $280.2 billion compared to the same periods in 2019. Debit card purchase volumes improved late in the second quarter of 2020 and continued throughout the third quarter of 2020 as businesses reopened.

Three-Month Comparison 

Net income for GWIM decreased $348 million to $749 million primarily due to lower revenue and higher noninterest expense. The operating margin was 22 percent compared to 30 percent a year ago. 

Net interest income decreased $372 million to $1.2 billion due to the impact of lower interest rates, partially offset by the benefit of strong deposit and loan growth. 

Noninterest income, which primarily includes investment and brokerage services income, remained relatively unchanged at $3.3 billion, as the benefits of higher market valuations and positive AUM flows were offset by declines in AUM pricing as well as lower other income due to the allocation of ALM results. 

The provision for credit losses decreased $13 million to $24 million. Noninterest expense increased $116 million to $3.5 billion primarily driven by higher revenue-related incentives and investments in primary sales professionals. 

The return on average allocated capital was 20 percent, down from 30 percent, due to lower net income and, to a lesser extent, a small increase in allocated capital. 

Average loans increased $15.2 billion to $185.6 billion primarily driven by residential mortgage and custom lending. Average deposits increased $37.4 billion to $291.8 billion primarily driven by inflows resulting from client responses to market volatility and lower spending. 

MLGWM revenue of $3.7 billion decreased eight percent primarily driven by the impact of lower interest rates, partially offset by the benefits of higher market valuations and positive AUM flows. 

Bank of America Private Bank revenue of $798 million decreased six percent primarily driven by the impact of lower interest rates.

Bank of America 16 

The provision for credit losses increased $286 million to $349 million primarily due to the weaker economic outlook related to COVID-19. Noninterest expense increased $291 million to $10.6 billion, primarily due to investments for business growth along with higher revenue-related incentives.

and excluding net DVA. Amounts excluding net DVA are a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information on net DVA, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 8. 

Three-Month Comparison 

Net income for Global Markets remained relatively unchanged at $857 million. Net DVA losses were $116 million compared to losses of $15 million in the prior-year period. Excluding net DVA, net income increased $86 million to $945 million. These increases were primarily driven by higher revenue, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. 

Revenue increased $420 million to $4.3 billion primarily driven by higher sales and trading revenue, investment banking fees and card income. Sales and trading revenue increased $16 million, and excluding net DVA, increased $117 million driven by increased client activity in Asian equities and stronger performance in mortgage and foreign exchange products. 

Noninterest expense increased $427 million to $3.1 billion driven by higher activity-based expenses for both card and trading. 

Average total assets decreased $6.4 billion to $681.0 billion driven by increased balance sheet efficiency in securities financing matched-book activity and lower levels of inventory in FICC, partially offset by higher client balances in Global Equities. 

The return on average allocated capital was nine percent, down from 10 percent, primarily due to an increase in allocated capital. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 12. 

Nine-Month Comparison 

Net income for Global Markets increased $1.5 billion to $4.5 billion. Net DVA losses were $77 million compared to losses of $136 million in the prior-year period. Excluding net DVA, net income increased $1.5 billion to $4.5 billion. These increases 

were primarily driven by an increase in revenue, partially offset by higher noninterest expense and provision for credit losses. 

Revenue increased $2.7 billion to $14.9 billion primarily driven by higher sales and trading revenue and investment banking fees. Sales and trading revenue increased $2.1 billion, and excluding net DVA, increased $2.0 billion. These increases were driven by higher revenue across FICC and Equities. 

The provision for credit losses increased $251 million primarily due to the weaker economic outlook related to COVID-19. Noninterest expense increased $489 million to $8.6 billion due to the same factors as described in the three-month discussion. 

Average total assets increased $6.6 billion to $685.7 billion primarily due to increased levels of inventory in FICC to facilitate expected client demand. Period-end total assets increased $34.4 billion since December 31, 2019 to $676.2 billion primarily driven by Equities due to increased hedging of client activity with stock positions relative to derivative transactions at year end. 

The return on average allocated capital was 17 percent, up from 11 percent, reflecting higher net income, partially offset by an increase in allocated capital.

Three-Month Comparison 

FICC revenue increased $52 million due to stronger performance in mortgages and foreign exchange products. Equities revenue increased $65 million driven by increased client activity in Asia. 

Nine-Month Comparison 

FICC revenue increased $1.4 billion driven by increased client activity and improved market-making conditions across macro products, partially offset by weaker performances in credit-sensitive businesses. Equities revenue increased $617 million driven by increased client activity and a strong trading performance in a more volatile market environment.

Average allocated assets were $828.3 billion and $714.2 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to $536.8 billion and $540.9 billion for the same periods in 2019, and period-end allocated assets were $857.8 billion and $565.4 billion at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. 

All Other consists of ALM activities, equity investments, non-core mortgage loans and servicing activities, liquidating businesses and certain expenses not otherwise allocated to a business segment. ALM activities encompass certain residential mortgages, debt securities, and interest rate and foreign currency risk management activities. Substantially all of the results of ALM activities are allocated to our business segments. For more information on our ALM activities, see Note 17 &#8211; Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Residential mortgage loans that are held for ALM purposes, including interest rate or liquidity risk management, are classified as core and are presented on the balance sheet of All Other . During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, residential mortgage loans held for ALM activities decreased $11.7 billion to $10.0 billion due primarily to loan sales. Non-core residential mortgage and home equity loans, which are principally runoff portfolios, are also held in All Other . During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, total non-core loans decreased $2.4 billion to $13.3 billion due primarily to payoffs and paydowns, as well as Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan conveyances and sales, partially offset by repurchases. For more information on the composition of the core and non-core portfolios, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 30. 

Three-Month Comparison 

Results for All Other improved $1.9 billion to net income of $297 million from a net loss of $1.6 billion in the prior-year period primarily due to a $2.1 billion pretax impairment charge related to the notice of termination of the merchant services joint venture in the prior year, partially offset by lower revenue and a decrease in the benefit in provision for credit losses. 

Revenue decreased $187 million due to lower noninterest income driven by the results of certain treasury activities and lower net interest income. 

Noninterest expense decreased $1.9 billion to $560 million due to the $2.1 billion pretax impairment charge in the prior-year period, partially offset by higher litigation expense. 

The benefit in the provision for credit losses decreased $277 million to $18 million primarily due to recoveries from sales of previously charged-off non-core consumer real estate loans in the prior-year period. 

The income tax benefit increased $454 million reflecting the impact of the U.K. tax law change, partially offset by the impact of decreased pretax losses and lower discrete tax benefits. For more information on the U.K. tax law change, see Financial Highlights on page 7. Both periods included income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Bankin g. 

Nine-Month Comparison 

Results for All Other improved $1.6 billion to net income of $19 million from a net loss of $1.6 billion in the prior-year period primarily due to the same factors as described in the three-month discussion. 

Revenue decreased $295 million primarily due to the results of certain treasury activities, valuation adjustments on securities and derivatives and extinguishment losses on certain structured liabilities, partially offset by a gain on sales of mortgage loans. 

The provision for credit losses increased $665 million to $75 million due to the same factor as described in the three-month discussion as well as the weaker economic outlook related to COVID-19. 

Noninterest expense decreased $2.3 billion to $1.1 billion due to the same factors as described in the three-month discussion. 

The income tax benefit increased $337 million due to the same factors as described in the three-month discussion. Both periods included income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking .

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations 

We have contractual obligations to make future payments on debt and lease agreements. Additionally, in the normal course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements whereby we commit to future purchases of products or services from unaffiliated parties. For more information on obligations and commitments, see Note 10 &#8211; Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein, as well as Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and Note 12 &#8211; Long-term Debt and Note 13 &#8211; Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Managing Risk 

Risk is inherent in all our business activities. The seven key types of risk faced by the Corporation are strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational. Sound risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver for our shareholders. If not managed well, risks can result in financial loss, regulatory sanctions and penalties, and damage to our reputation, each of which may adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategies. We take a comprehensive approach to risk management with a defined Risk Framework and an articulated Risk Appetite Statement which are approved annually by the Enterprise Risk Committee and the Board. 

Our Risk Framework serves as the foundation for the consistent and effective management of risks facing the Corporation. The Risk Framework sets forth clear roles, responsibilities and accountability for the management of risk and provides a blueprint for how the Board, through delegation of authority to committees and executive officers, establishes risk appetite and associated limits for our activities. 

Our Risk Appetite Statement is intended to ensure that the Corporation maintains an acceptable risk profile by providing a common framework and a comparable set of measures for senior management and the Board to clearly indicate the level of risk the Corporation is willing to accept. Risk appetite is set at least annually and is aligned with the Corporation&#8217;s strategic, capital and financial operating plans. Our line-of-business strategies and risk appetite are also similarly aligned. 

For more information about the Corporation's risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic, see Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors on page 105. These COVID-19 related risks are being managed within our Risk Framework and supporting risk management programs. 

For more information on our Risk Framework, our risk management activities and the key types of risk faced by the Corporation, see the Managing Risk through Reputational Risk sections in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Capital Management 

The Corporation manages its capital position so that its capital is more than adequate to support its business activities and aligns with risk, risk appetite and strategic planning. For more information on capital management, including related regulatory requirements, see Capital Management in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

CCAR and Capital Planning 

The Federal Reserve requires BHCs to submit a capital plan and planned capital actions on an annual basis, consistent with the rules governing the CCAR capital plan. In June 2020, the Federal Reserve notified BHCs of their 2020 CCAR supervisory stress test results, which included a preliminary stress capital buffer (SCB) that was finalized in August 2020. Based on our results, we are subject to a 2.5 percent SCB for the period beginning October 1, 2020 and ending on September 30, 2021. Our Common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio under the Standardized approach must remain above 9.5 percent during this period (the sum of our CET1 capital ratio minimum of 4.5 percent, global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge of 2.5 percent and our SCB of 2.5 percent) in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. 

Due to economic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve required all large banks to suspend share repurchase programs in the third quarter of 2020, except for repurchases to offset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans, and to limit dividends to existing rates that do not exceed the average of the last four quarters&#8217; net income. In September 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that these measures would remain in place for the fourth quarter of 2020. Large banks will also be required to update and resubmit their capital plans in November 2020 based on the Federal Reserve&#8217;s updated supervisory stress test scenarios. The Federal Reserve announced that it will publish the results of the additional supervisory stress tests by December 31, 2020. 

As previously disclosed, the Federal Reserve&#8217;s directives regarding share repurchases aligned with our decision to voluntarily suspend our general common stock repurchase program during the first half of 2020. The suspension of our repurchases did not include repurchases to offset shares awarded under our equity-based compensation plans, for which we repurchased $114 million of common stock during the third quarter of 2020 pursuant to the Board&#8217;s repurchase authorization. 

We intend to maintain the quarterly common stock dividend at the current rate of $0.18 per share until further notice, subject to approval by the Board. We will also continue our current suspension of common stock repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2020, except for repurchases to offset shares awarded under our equity-based compensation plans, which have previously been authorized by the Board. 

Our general common stock repurchase program is subject to the Board&#8217;s approval, and at such time that we reinstate our stock repurchase program, our stock repurchases will be subject to various factors, including the Corporation&#8217;s capital position, liquidity, financial performance and alternative uses of capital, stock trading price and general market conditions, and may be suspended at any time. Such repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including repurchase plans that satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act).

Regulatory Capital 

As a financial services holding company, we are subject to regulatory capital rules, including Basel 3, issued by U.S. banking regulators. The Corporation's depository institution subsidiaries are also subject to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework. The Corporation and its primary affiliated banking entity, BANA, are Advanced approaches institutions under Basel 3 and are required to report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and risk-weighted assets (RWA) under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is used to assess capital adequacy including under the PCA framework. As of September 30, 2020, the CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios for the Corporation were lower under the Standardized approach. 

Minimum Capital Requirements 

In order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments, the Corporation must meet risk-based capital ratio requirements that include a capital conservation buffer greater than 2.5 percent, plus any 

applicable countercyclical capital buffer and a G-SIB surcharge. On October 1, 2020, the capital conservation buffer was replaced by the SCB for the Corporation&#8217;s Standardized approach ratio requirements. The buffers and surcharge must be comprised solely of CET1 capital. 

The Corporation is also required to maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Our insured depository institution subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be considered well capitalized under the PCA framework. 

Capital Composition and Ratios 

Table 8 presents Bank of America Corporation&#8217;s capital ratios and related information in accordance with Basel 3 Standardized and Advanced approaches as measured at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. For the periods presented herein, the Corporation met the definition of well capitalized under current regulatory requirements.

(1) As of September 30, 2020, capital ratios are calculated using the regulatory capital rule that allows a five-year transition period related to the adoption of CECL. 

(2) Derivative exposure amounts are calculated using the standardized approach for measuring counterparty credit risk at September 30, 2020 and the current exposure method at December 31, 2019. 

(3) The capital conservation buffer and G-SIB surcharge were 2.5 percent at both September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The countercyclical capital buffer for both periods was zero. The SLR minimum includes a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent. 

(4) Total capital under the Advanced approaches differs from the Standardized approach due to differences in the amount permitted in Tier 2 capital related to the qualifying allowance for credit losse s. 

(5) Reflects total average assets adjusted for certain Tier 1 capital deductions. 

(6) Supplementary leverage exposure at September 30, 2020 reflects the temporary exclusion of U.S. Treasury Securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks. 

At September 30, 2020, CET1 capital was $173.2 billion, an increase of $6.5 billion from December 31, 2019, driven by earnings and net unrealized gains on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities included in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI), partially offset by common stock repurchases and 

dividends. Total capital under the Standardized approach increased $14.2 billion primarily driven by the same factors as CET1 capital, an increase in the adjusted allowance for credit losses included in Tier 2 capital and the issuance of preferred stock. RWA under the Standardized approach, which yielded the 

Bank of America 24 

lower CET1 capital ratio at September 30, 2020, decreased $33.5 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 to $1,460 billion primarily due to lower exposures in Global Banking and Consumer Banking , partially offset by 

increases in counterparty credit risk and market risk RWA. Table 9 shows the capital composition at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019.

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity Requirements 

Total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) consists of the Corporation&#8217;s Tier 1 capital and eligible long-term debt issued directly by the Corporation. Eligible long-term debt for TLAC ratios is comprised of unsecured debt that has a remaining maturity of at least one year and satisfies additional requirements as prescribed in the TLAC final rule. As with the 

risk-based capital ratios and SLR, the Corporation is required to maintain TLAC ratios in excess of minimum requirements plus applicable buffers to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Table 12 presents the Corporation's TLAC and long-term debt ratios and related information as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019.

(2) The TLAC RWA regulatory minimum consists of 18.0 percent plus a TLAC RWA buffer comprised of 2.5 percent plus the method 1 G-SIB surcharge of 1.5 percent. The countercyclical buffer is zero for both periods. The TLAC supplementary leverage exposure regulatory minimum consists of 7.5 percent plus a 2.0 percent TLAC leverage buffer. The TLAC RWA and leverage buffers must be comprised solely of CET1 capital and Tier 1 capital, respectively. 

(3) The long-term debt RWA regulatory minimum is comprised of 6.0 percent plus an additional 2.5 percent requirement based on the Corporation&#8217;s method 2 G-SIB surcharge. The long-term debt leverage exposure regulatory minimum is 4.5 percent. 

(4) The approach that yields the higher RWA is used to calculate TLAC and long-term debt ratios, which was the Standardized approach as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. 

(5) Supplementary leverage exposure at September 30, 2020 reflects the temporary exclusion of U.S. Treasury Securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks.

Regulatory Developments 

The following supplements the disclosure in Capital Management &#8211; Regulatory Developments in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the Corporation's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2020. 

Deduction of Unsecured Debt of G-SIBs 

On October 20, 2020, the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (U.S. Agencies) finalized a rule requiring Advanced approaches institutions to deduct from regulatory capital certain investments in TLAC-eligible long-term debt and other pari passu or subordinated debt instruments issued by G-SIBs above a specified threshold. The final rule is intended to limit the interconnectedness between G-SIBs and is complementary to existing regulatory capital requirements that generally require banks to deduct investments in the regulatory capital of financial institutions. The final rule is effective April 1, 2021. The impact to the Corporation is not expected to be significant. 

Regulatory Capital and Securities Regulation 

The Corporation&#8217;s principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are BofA Securities, Inc. (BofAS), Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp. (MLPCC) and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &#38; Smith Incorporated (MLPF&#38;S). The Corporation's principal European broker-dealer subsidiaries are Merrill Lynch International (MLI) and BofA Securities Europe SA (BofASE). 

The U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the net capital requirements of Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act. BofAS computes its minimum capital requirements as an alternative net capital broker-dealer under Rule 15c3-1e, and MLPCC and MLPF&#38;S compute their minimum capital requirements in accordance with the alternative standard under Rule 15c3-1. BofAS and MLPCC are also registered as futures commission merchants and are subject to Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Regulation 1.17. The U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are also registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA). Pursuant to FINRA Rule 4110, FINRA may impose higher net capital requirements than Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act with respect to each of the broker-dealers. 

BofAS provides institutional services, and in accordance with the alternative net capital requirements, is required to maintain tentative net capital in excess of $1.0 billion and net capital in excess of the greater of $500 million or a certain percentage of 

its reserve requirement. BofAS must also notify the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the event its tentative net capital is less than $5.0 billion. BofAS is also required to hold a certain percentage of its customers' and affiliates' risk-based margin in order to meet its CFTC minimum net capital requirement. At September 30, 2020, BofAS had tentative net capital of $20.3 billion. BofAS also had regulatory net capital of $17.9 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement of $3.0 billion. 

MLPCC is a fully-guaranteed subsidiary of BofAS and provides clearing and settlement services as well as prime brokerage and arranged financing services for institutional clients. At September 30, 2020, MLPCC&#8217;s regulatory net capital of $7.2 billion exceeded the minimum requirement of $1.2 billion. 

MLPF&#38;S provides retail services. At September 30, 2020, MLPF&#38;S' regulatory net capital was $3.4 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement of $147 million. 

Our European broker-dealers are regulated by non-U.S. regulators. MLI, a U.K. investment firm, is regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority and is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. At September 30, 2020, MLI&#8217;s capital resources were $35.1 billion, which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $13.8 billion. BofASE, a French investment firm, is regulated by the Autorit&#233; de Contr&#244;le Prudentiel et de R&#233;solution and the Autorit&#233; des March&#233;s Financiers, and is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. At September 30, 2020, BofASE's capital resources were $6.0 billion which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $1.9 billion. 

Liquidity Risk 

Funding and Liquidity Risk Management 

Our primary liquidity risk management objective is to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral needs while continuing to support our businesses and customers under a range of economic conditions. To achieve that objective, we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk under expected and stressed conditions, maintain liquidity and access to diverse funding sources, including our stable deposit base, and seek to align liquidity-related incentives and risks. These liquidity risk management practices have allowed us to effectively manage the market stress that began in the first quarter of 2020 from the COVID-19 pandemic. For more information on the effects of 

27 Bank of America 

the pandemic, see Executive Summary - Recent Developments &#8211; COVID-19 Pandemic on page 3. 

We define liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we can use to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations as those obligations arise. We manage our liquidity position through line-of-business and ALM activities, as well as through our legal entity funding strategy, on both a forward and current (including intraday) basis under both expected and stressed conditions. We believe that a centralized approach to funding and liquidity management enhances our ability to monitor liquidity requirements, maximizes access to funding sources, minimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely responses to liquidity events. For more information regarding global funding and liquidity risk management, as well as liquidity sources, liquidity arrangements, contingency planning and credit ratings discussed below, see Liquidity Risk in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

NB Holdings Corporation 

We have intercompany arrangements with certain key subsidiaries under which we transferred certain assets of Bank of America Corporation, as the parent company, which is a separate and distinct legal entity from our banking and nonbank subsidiaries, and agreed to transfer certain additional parent company assets not needed to satisfy anticipated near term expenditures, to NB Holdings Corporation, a wholly-owned holding company subsidiary (NB Holdings). The parent company is expected to continue to have access to the same flow of dividends, interest and other amounts of cash necessary to service its debt, pay dividends and perform other obligations as it would have had if it had not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets. These arrangements support our preferred single point of entry resolution strategy, under which only the parent company would be resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 

Global Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered Assets 

Table 13 presents average Global Liquidity Sources (GLS) for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019.

$ 859 &#160; $ 576 

(1) Nonbank includes Parent, NB Holdings and other regulated entities. 

We maintain liquidity available to the Corporation, including the parent company and selected subsidiaries, in the form of cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. Typically, parent company and NB Holdings liquidity is in the form of cash deposited with BANA. 

Our bank subsidiaries&#8217; liquidity is primarily driven by deposit and lending activity, as well as securities valuation and net debt activity. Liquidity at bank subsidiaries excludes the cash deposited by the parent company and NB Holdings. Our bank subsidiaries can also generate incremental liquidity by pledging a range of unencumbered loans and securities to certain Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) and the Federal Reserve 

Discount Window. The cash we could have obtained by borrowing against this pool of specifically-identified eligible assets was $320 billion and $372 billion at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. We have established operational procedures to enable us to borrow against these assets, including regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible loans and securities collateral. Eligibility is defined in guidelines from the FHLBs and the Federal Reserve and is subject to change at their discretion. Due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries can generally be used only to fund obligations within the bank subsidiaries, and transfers to the parent company or nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to prior regulatory approval. 

Liquidity held in other regulated entities, comprised primarily of broker-dealer subsidiaries, is primarily available to meet the obligations of that entity, and transfers to the parent company or to any other subsidiary may be subject to prior regulatory approval due to regulatory restrictions and minimum requirements. Our other regulated entities also hold unencumbered investment-grade securities and equities that we believe could be used to generate additional liquidity. 

Table 14 presents the composition of average GLS for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. 

Table 14 Average Global Liquidity Sources Composition Three Months Ended (Dollars in billions) September 30 2020 December 31 2019 Cash on deposit $ 244 &#160; $ 103 U.S. Treasury securities 166 &#160; 98 U.S. agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, and other investment-grade securities

Our GLS are substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the final U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) rules. However, HQLA for purposes of calculating LCR is not reported at market value, but at a lower value that incorporates regulatory deductions and the exclusion of excess liquidity held at certain subsidiaries. The LCR is calculated as the amount of a financial institution&#8217;s unencumbered HQLA relative to the estimated net cash outflows the institution could encounter over a 30-day period of significant liquidity stress, expressed as a percentage. Our average consolidated HQLA, on a net basis, was $562 billion and $464 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. For the same periods, the average consolidated LCR was 122 percent and 116 percent. Our LCR fluctuates due to normal business flows from customer activity. 

Liquidity Stress Analysis 

We utilize liquidity stress analysis to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our subsidiaries to meet contractual and contingent cash outflows under a range of scenarios. For more information on our liquidity stress analysis, see Liquidity Risk &#8211; Liquidity Stress Analysis in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Bank of America 28 

Net Stable Funding Ratio Final Rule 

On October 20, 2020, the U.S. Agencies finalized the Net Stable Funding Ratio, a rule requiring large banks to maintain a minimum level of stable funding over a one-year period. The final rule is intended to support the ability of banks to lend to households and businesses in both normal and adverse economic conditions and is complementary to the LCR rule, which focuses on short-term liquidity risks. The final rule is effective July 1, 2021. The impact to the Corporation is not expected to be significant. 

Diversified Funding Sources 

We fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits, and secured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally coordinated funding approach diversified across products, programs, markets, currencies and investor groups. We fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposits, which were $1.70 trillion and $1.43 trillion at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. 

Our trading activities in other regulated entities are primarily funded on a secured basis through securities lending and repurchase agreements, and these amounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions. 

Long-term Debt 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, we issued $40.7 billion of long-term debt consisting of $32.9 billion of notes issued by Bank of America Corporation, substantially all of which was TLAC compliant, $1.9 billion of notes issued by Bank of America, N.A. and $5.9 billion of other debt. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, we had total long-term debt maturities and redemptions in the aggregate of $36.4 billion consisting of $16.4 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $10.1 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $9.9 billion of other debt. Table 15 presents the carrying value of aggregate annual contractual maturities of long-term debt at September 30, 2020.

(1) Total includes $139.8 billion of outstanding notes that are both TLAC eligible and callable one year before their stated maturities, including $2.8 billion during the remainder of 2020, and $11.8 billion, $15.2 billion, $12.0 billion and $11.6 billion during each year of 2021 through 2024, respectively, and $86.4 billion thereafter. The call features provide the flexibility to retire long-term notes before their final year outstanding, when they are no longer eligible to count toward TLAC requirements, and replace them with new TLAC-eligible debt, should we choose to do so. 

(2) Represents liabilities of consolidated VIEs included in total long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

Total long-term debt increased $14.9 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 primarily due to debt issuances and valuation adjustments, partially offset by maturities and redemptions. We may, from time to time, purchase outstanding debt instruments in various transactions, depending on market conditions, liquidity and other factors. Our other regulated entities may also make markets in our debt instruments to provide liquidity for investors. 

We use derivative transactions to manage the duration, interest rate and currency risks of our borrowings, considering the characteristics of the assets they are funding. For more information on our ALM activities, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 48. 

We may issue unsecured debt in the form of structured notes for client purposes, certain of which qualify as TLAC-eligible debt. During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, we issued $6.1 billion of structured notes, which are unsecured debt obligations that pay investors returns linked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. We typically hedge the returns we are obligated to 

pay on these liabilities with derivatives and/or investments in the underlying instruments, so that from a funding perspective, the cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. We could be required to settle certain structured note obligations for cash or other securities prior to maturity under certain circumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning purposes. We believe, however, that a portion of such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or redemption date. 

Substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price. For more information on long-term debt funding, including issuances and maturities and redemptions, see Note 12 &#8211; Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K .

Credit Ratings 

Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by rating agencies on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and other securities, including asset securitizations. Table 16 presents the Corporation&#8217;s current long-term/short-term senior debt ratings and outlooks expressed by the rating agencies. 

The ratings and outlooks from Fitch Ratings for the Corporation and its subsidiaries have not changed from those disclosed in the Corporation&#8217;s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2020. The ratings and outlooks 

from Moody&#8217;s Investors Service (Moody&#8217;s) and Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s Global Ratings for the Corporation and its subsidiaries did not change from those disclosed in the Corporation's 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Credit Risk Management 

For information on our credit risk management activities, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management below, Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 37, Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 43, Allowance for Credit Losses on page 44, and Note 5 &#8211; Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted economic activity in the U.S. and around the world. However, there were also positive signs during this period as parts of the economy began to reopen, and unemployment dropped from double-digit highs in the second quarter of 2020. To provide relief to individuals and businesses in the U.S., the President signed into law four economic stimulus packages in March and April 2020, including the CARES Act, and also signed an executive order in August 2020 to establish the Lost Wage Assistance Program. In addition, U.S. bank regulatory agencies also issued interagency guidance to financial institutions that are working with borrowers affected by COVID-19. 

Consumer charge-offs remained low during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 due to payment deferrals and government stimulus benefits. However, we experienced increases in nonperforming loans and commercial reservable criticized utilized exposures as a result of weaker economic conditions arising from COVID-19, particularly in certain sectors of the economy that have been more significantly impacted during the pandemic (e.g., travel and entertainment). 

To support our customers, we implemented various loan modification programs and other forms of support beginning in March 2020, including offering loan payment deferrals, refunding certain fees, and pausing foreclosure sales, evictions and repossessions. During the three months ended September 30, 2020, we experienced a decline in the need for customer assistance as the number of customer accounts and balances on deferral decreased significantly. For information on the accounting for loan modifications related to the COVID-19 

pandemic, see Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management 

Credit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower&#8217;s credit cycle. Statistical techniques in conjunction with experiential judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio management including underwriting, product pricing, risk appetite, setting credit limits, and establishing operating processes and metrics to quantify and balance risks and returns. Statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external sources such as credit bureaus and/or internal historical experience and are a component of our consumer credit risk management process. These models are used in part to assist in making both new and ongoing credit decisions, as well as portfolio management strategies, including authorizations and line management, collection practices and strategies, and determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses and allocated capital for credit risk. 

Consumer Credit Portfolio 

While COVID-19 is severely impacting economic activity, and is contributing to increasing delinquencies and nonperforming loans within certain consumer portfolios, it did not have a significant impact on consumer portfolio charge-offs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 due to payment deferrals and government stimulus benefits. However, COVID-19 could lead to adverse impacts to credit quality metrics in future periods if negative economic conditions continue or worsen. Net charge-offs decreased $58 million to $564 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 due to lower credit card losses and remained relatively flat at $2.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. 

The consumer allowance for loan and lease losses increased $6.1 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 to $10.7 billion due to the adoption of the new CECL accounting standard and deterioration in the economic outlook resulting

from the impact of COVID-19. For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 44.

Table 19 presents outstandings, nonperforming balances, net charge-offs, allowance for credit losses and provision for credit losses for the core and non-core portfolios within the consumer real estate portfolio. We categorize consumer real estate loans as core and non-core based on loan and customer characteristics such as origination date, product type, LTV, Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score and delinquency status consistent with our current consumer and mortgage servicing strategy. Generally, loans that were originated after January 1, 2010, qualified under government-sponsored enterprise underwriting guidelines, or otherwise met our underwriting 

guidelines in place in 2015 are characterized as core loans. All other loans are generally characterized as non-core loans and represent runoff portfolios. Core loans as reported in Table 19 include loans held in the Consumer Banking and GWIM segments, as well as loans held for ALM activities in All Other . 

As shown in Table 19, outstanding core consumer real estate loans decreased $4.8 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 driven by a decrease of $1.9 billion in residential mortgage and a $2.9 billion decrease in home equity.

(1) Outstandings and nonperforming loans exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. Consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option include residential mortgage loans of $314 million and $257 million and home equity loans of $343 million and $337 million at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. For more information, see Note 15 &#8211; Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

(2) The home equity non-core allowance is in a negative position at September 30, 2020 as it includes expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off. 

(3) Home equity allowance includes a reserve for unfunded lending commitments of $138 million at September 30, 2020. 

We believe that the presentation of information adjusted to exclude the impact of the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option is more representative of the ongoing operations and credit quality of the business. As a result, in the following tables and discussions of the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios, we exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option and provide information that excludes the impact of the fully-insured loan portfolio in certain credit quality statistics. 

Residential Mortgage 

The residential mortgage portfolio made up the largest percentage of our consumer loan portfolio at 53 percent of consumer loans and leases at September 30, 2020. Approximately 53 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio was in Consumer Banking and 39 percent was in GWIM. The remaining portion was in All Other and was comprised of loans used in our overall ALM activities, delinquent FHA loans repurchased pursuant to our servicing agreements with the 

Government National Mortgage Association as well as loans repurchased related to our representations and warranties. 

Outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio decreased $3.5 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as both loan sales and runoff were partially offset by originations. 

At September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the residential mortgage portfolio included $11.7 billion and $18.7 billion of outstanding fully-insured loans, of which $3.0 billion and $11.2 billion had FHA insurance with the remainder protected by Fannie Mae long-term standby agreements. The decline was primarily driven by sales of loans with FHA insurance during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. 

Table 20 presents certain residential mortgage key credit statistics on both a reported basis and excluding the fully-insured loan portfolio. The following discussion presents the residential mortgage portfolio excluding the fully-insured loan portfolio.

For information on our interest accrual policies and delinquency status for loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic, see Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

(2) Includes loans that are contractually current which primarily consist of collateral-dependent TDRs, including those that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy and loans that have not yet demonstrated a sustained period of payment performance following a TDR. 

(3) These vintages of loans accounted for $481 million, or 29 percent, and $365 million, or 25 percent, of nonperforming residential mortgage loans at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. 

Nonperforming outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio increased $205 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 primarily driven by loans with deferrals that expired and have subsequently become nonperforming, and the inclusion of certain loans that, upon adoption of the new credit loss standard, became accounted for on an individual basis, which previously had been accounted for under a pool basis. Of the nonperforming residential mortgage loans at September 30, 2020, $531 million, or 32 percent, were current on contractual payments. Loans accruing past due 30 days or more increased $98 million driven primarily by borrowers whose deferrals expired throughout the year and have subsequently become delinquent. 

Net charge-offs increased $32 million and $24 million to a net recovery of $6 million and $27 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. This increase is due largely to lower recoveries from the sales of previously charged-off loans. 

Of the $221.0 billion in total residential mortgage loans outstanding at September 30, 2020, as shown in Table 20, 27 percent were originated as interest-only loans. The outstanding balance of interest-only residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period was $6.3 billion, or 11 percent, at September 30, 2020. Residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period generally have experienced a higher rate of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status compared to the residential mortgage portfolio as a 

whole. At September 30, 2020, $101 million, or two percent of outstanding interest-only residential mortgages that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more compared to $1.4 billion, or less than one percent, for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, at September 30, 2020, $329 million, or five percent, of outstanding interest-only residential mortgage loans that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming, of which $71 million were contractually current, compared to $1.7 billion, or one percent, for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. Loans that have yet to enter the amortization period in our interest-only residential mortgage portfolio are primarily well-collateralized loans to our wealth management clients and have an interest-only period of three to ten years. Approximately 97 percent of these loans that have yet to enter the amortization period will not be required to make a fully-amortizing payment until 2022 or later. 

Table 21 presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the residential mortgage portfolio. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) within California represented 16 percent of outstandings at both September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 14 percent and 13 percent of outstandings at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019.

Home Equity 

At September 30, 2020, the home equity portfolio made up eight percent of the consumer portfolio and was comprised of home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), home equity loans and reverse mortgages. We no longer originate home equity loans or reverse mortgages. 

At September 30, 2020, our HELOC portfolio had an outstanding balance of $34.2 billion, or 94 percent of the total home equity portfolio, compared to $37.5 billion, or 93 percent, at December 31, 2019. HELOCs generally have an initial draw period of 10 years, and after the initial draw period ends, the loans generally convert to 15- or 20-year amortizing loans. 

At September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, our home equity loan portfolio had an outstanding balance of $974 million and $1.2 billion, or three percent, of the total home equity portfolio. At September 30, 2020, our reverse mortgage portfolio had an outstanding balance of $1.3 billion, or three percent of the total home equity portfolio, compared to $1.5 billion, or four percent, at December 31, 2019. 

At September 30, 2020, 80 percent of the home equity portfolio was in Consumer Banking , 12 percent was in All Other and the remainder of the portfolio was primarily in GWIM . Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased $3.7 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 primarily due to paydowns outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines. Of the total home equity portfolio at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, $14.3 billion, or 39 percent, and $15.0 billion, or 37 percent, were in first-lien positions. At September 30, 2020, outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio that were in a second-lien or more junior-lien position and where we also held the first-lien loan totaled $6.3 billion, or 17 percent, of our total home equity portfolio. 

Unused HELOCs totaled $43.5 billion and $43.6 billion at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The HELOC utilization rate was 44 percent and 46 percent at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019.

For information on our interest accrual policies and delinquency status for loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic, see Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

(2) Accruing past due 30 days or more include $30 million at both September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, and nonperforming loans include $84 million and $57 million of loans where we serviced the underlying first lien at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. 

(3) Includes loans that are contractually current which primarily consist of collateral-dependent TDRs, including those that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, junior-lien loans where the underlying first lien is 90 days or more past due, as well as loans that have not yet demonstrated a sustained period of payment performance following a TDR. 

(4) These vintages of loans accounted for 36 percent and 34 percent of nonperforming home equity loans at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. 

Nonperforming outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio increased $104 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 primarily driven by loans with deferrals that expired and have subsequently become nonperforming . Of the nonperforming home equity loans at September 30, 2020, $262 million, or 41 percent, were current on contractual payments. In addition, $223 million, or 35 percent, of nonperforming home equity loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell. Accruing loans that were 30 days or more past due decreased $3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. 

Net charge-offs increased $182 million to a net recovery of $20 million, and $301 million to a net recovery of $45 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 as the prior-year period included recoveries from non-core home equity loan sales. 

Of the $36.5 billion in total home equity portfolio outstandings at September 30, 2020, as shown in Table 22, 15 percent require interest-only payments. The outstanding balance of HELOCs that have reached the end of their draw period and have entered the amortization period was $9.9 billion at September 30, 2020. The HELOCs that have entered the 

amortization period have experienced a higher percentage of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status when compared to the HELOC portfolio as a whole. At September 30, 2020, $145 million, or one percent of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more. In addition, at September 30, 2020, $473 million, or five percent, were nonperforming. Loans that have yet to enter the amortization period in our interest-only portfolio are primarily post-2008 vintages and generally have better credit quality than the previous vintages that had entered the amortization period. We communicate to contractually current customers more than a year prior to the end of their draw period to inform them of the potential change to the payment structure before entering the amortization period, and provide payment options to customers prior to the end of the draw period. 

Although we do not actively track how many of our home equity customers pay only the minimum amount due on their home equity loans and lines, we can infer some of this information through a review of our HELOC portfolio that we service and that is still in its revolving period. During the three months ended September 30, 2020, 17 percent of these customers with an outstanding balance did not pay any principal on their HELOCs.

Table 23 presents outstandings, nonperforming balances and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the home equity portfolio. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 13 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both September 30, 2020 

and December 31, 2019. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana MSA within California made up 11 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019.

Credit Card 

At September 30, 2020, 97 percent of the credit card portfolio was managed in Consumer Banking with the remainder in GWIM . Outstandings in the credit card portfolio decreased $17.8 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 to $79.8 billion due to lower retail spending. Net charge-offs decreased $208 million to $509 million and $280 million to $1.9 billion during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 due to government stimulus benefits and payment deferrals associated with COVID-19. Credit card loans 30 days or more past due and still 

accruing interest decreased $765 million and loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest decreased $496 million primarily due to government stimulus benefits and payment deferrals along with declines in loan balances associated with COVID-19. 

Unused lines of credit for credit card increased to $344.6 billion at September 30, 2020 from $336.9 billion at December 31, 2019 driven by decreased consumer spending.

Direct/Indirect Consumer 

At September 30, 2020, 53 percent of the direct/indirect portfolio was included in Consumer Banking (consumer auto and specialty lending &#8211; automotive, recreational vehicle, marine, aircraft and consumer personal loans) and 47 percent was 

included in GWIM (principally securities-based lending loans). Outstandings in the direct/indirect portfolio decreased $1.1 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 to $89.9 billion primarily due to lower originations in Auto.

Nonperforming Consumer Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity 

Table 26 presents nonperforming consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019. During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, nonperforming consumer loans increased $304 million to $2.4 billion primarily driven by loans with deferrals that expired and have subsequently become nonperforming, as well as the inclusion of $137 million of certain loans that were previously classified as purchased credit-impaired loans and accounted for under a pool basis. 

At September 30, 2020, $791 million, or 34 percent of nonperforming loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to their estimated property value less costs to sell. In addition, at September 30, 2020, $831 million, or 35 percent of nonperforming consumer loans were modified and 

are now current after successful trial periods, or are current loans classified as nonperforming loans in accordance with applicable policies. 

Foreclosed properties decreased $94 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 to $135 million as liquidations outpaced additions. 

Nonperforming loans also include certain loans that have been modified in TDRs where economic concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. Nonperforming TDRs are included in Table 26. For more information on our loan modification programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which are not TDRs, see Executive Summary - Recent Developments &#8211; COVID-19 Pandemic on page 3 and Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(1) At September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, residential mortgage TDRs deemed collateral dependent totaled $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion, and included $709 million and $748 million of loans classified as nonperforming and $386 million and $468 million of loans classified as performing. 

(2) At September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, residential mortgage performing TDRs include $1.6 billion and $2.1 billion of loans that were fully-insured. 

(3) At September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, home equity TDRs deemed collateral dependent totaled $408 million and $442 million, and include $206 million and $209 million of loans classified as nonperforming and $202 million and $233 million of loans classified as performing. 

In addition to modifying consumer real estate loans, we work with customers who are experiencing financial difficulty by modifying credit card and other consumer loans. Credit card and other consumer loan modifications generally involve a reduction in the customer&#8217;s interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months. 

Modifications of credit card and other consumer loans are made through programs utilizing direct customer contact, but may also utilize external programs. At September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, our credit card and other consumer TDR portfolio was $699 million and $679 million, of which $624 million and $570 million were current or less than 30 days past due under the modified terms. 

Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management 

Commercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal that concentrations of credit exposure continue to be aligned with our risk appetite. We review, measure and manage concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, customer relationship and loan size. We also review, measure and manage commercial real estate loans by geographic location and property type. In addition, within our non-U.S. portfolio, we evaluate exposures by region and by country. Tables 32, 35 and 38 summarize our concentrations. We also utilize syndications of exposure to third parties, loan sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of the commercial credit portfolio. For more information on our industry concentrations, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management &#8211; Industry Concentrations on page 41 and Table 35.

Commercial Credit Portfolio 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, commercial asset quality weakened as a result of the economic impact from COVID-19. However, there were also positive signs during this period. The draws by large corporate and commercial clients contributing to the $67.2 billion loan growth in the first quarter of 2020 have largely been repaid over the past six months as emergency or contingent funding was no longer needed or clients were able to access capital markets. Additionally, as part of the CARES Act, we had $24.7 billion of PPP loans outstanding with our small business clients at September 30, 2020, which are included in U.S. small business commercial in the tables in this section. For more information on PPP loans, see Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Credit quality of commercial real estate borrowers has begun to stabilize in many sectors as certain economies have reopened. Certain sectors, including hospitality and retail, continue to be negatively impacted as a result of COVID-19. Moreover, many real estate markets, while improving, are still experiencing some disruptions in demand, supply chain challenges and tenant difficulties. 

The commercial allowance for loan and lease losses increased $4.0 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 to $8.9 billion due to the deterioration in the economic outlook resulting from the impact of COVID-19. For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 44. 

Total commercial utilized credit exposure decreased $4.1 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 to $631.2 billion driven by lower loans held-for-sale (LHFS) and lower loans and leases. The utilization rate for loans and leases, standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and financial guarantees, and commercial letters of credit, in the aggregate, was 58 percent at both September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. 

37 Bank of America 

Table 28 presents commercial credit exposure by type for utilized, unfunded and total binding committed credit exposure. Commercial utilized credit exposure includes SBLCs and financial guarantees and commercial letters of credit that have been issued and for which we are legally bound to advance 

funds under prescribed conditions during a specified time period, and excludes exposure related to trading account assets. Although funds have not yet been advanced, these exposure types are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes.

(5) Derivative assets are carried at fair value, reflect the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and have been reduced by cash collateral of $41.3 billion and $33.9 billion at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Not reflected in utilized and committed exposure is additional non-cash derivative collateral held of $35.0 billion and $35.2 billion at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, which consists primarily of other marketable securities. 

Outstanding commercial loans and leases decreased $2.3 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 primarily due to repayments, partially offset by $24.7 billion of PPP loans outstanding at September 30, 2020. Nonperforming commercial loans increased $694 million across industries, and commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure increased 

$24.3 billion spread across several industries, including travel and entertainment, as a result of weaker economic conditions arising from COVID-19. Table 29 presents our commercial loans and leases portfolio and related credit quality information at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019.

Table 31 presents commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure by loan type. Criticized exposure corresponds to the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful asset categories as defined by regulatory authorities. Total commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure increased $24.3 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2020, which was spread across several industries, including travel and entertainment, as a result of weaker economic conditions arising from COVID-19. At September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, 84 percent and 90 percent of commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure was secured.

Commercial and Industrial 

Commercial and industrial loans include U.S. commercial and non-U.S. commercial portfolios. 

U.S. Commercial 

At September 30, 2020, 66 percent of the U.S. commercial loan portfolio, excluding small business, was managed in Global Banking, 17 percent in Global Markets , 15 percent in GWIM (generally business-purpose loans for high net worth clients) and the remainder primarily in Consumer Banking . U.S. commercial loans decreased $13.1 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 primarily in Global Banking . Reservable criticized utilized exposure increased $14.0 billion, which was spread across several industries, including travel and entertainment, as a result of weaker economic conditions arising from COVID-19. 

Non-U.S. Commercial 

At September 30, 2020, 81 percent of the non-U.S. commercial loan portfolio was managed in Global Banking and 19 percent in Global Markets . Non-U.S. commercial loans decreased $8.8 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily in Global Banking . For information on the non-U.S. commercial portfolio, see Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 43. 

Commercial Real Estate 

Commercial real estate primarily includes commercial loans secured by non-owner-occupied real estate and is dependent on the sale or lease of the real estate as the primary source of repayment. Outstanding loans remained relatively flat at $62.5 billion at September 30, 2020 as paydowns were offset by new originations and increased utilizations under existing credit facilities. Reservable criticized utilized exposure increased $5.9 billion due to downgrades driven by the impact of COVID-19 across industries, led by hotels. Although we have observed property-level improvements in a number of the most impacted sectors, the length of time for recovery has been slower than originally anticipated, which has prompted these downgrades. The portfolio remains diversified across property types and geographic regions. California represented the largest state concentration at 23 percent and 24 percent of the commercial real estate portfolio at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The commercial real estate portfolio is predominantly managed in Global Banking and consists of loans made primarily to public and private developers, and commercial real estate firms. 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, we continued to see low default rates and varying degrees of improvement in the non-residential portfolio. We use a number of proactive risk mitigation initiatives to reduce adversely rated exposure in the commercial real estate portfolio, including 

39 Bank of America 

transfers of deteriorating exposures to management by independent special asset officers and the pursuit of loan restructurings or asset sales to achieve the best results for our customers and the Corporation.

U.S. Small Business Commercial 

The U.S. small business commercial loan portfolio is comprised of small business card loans and small business loans primarily managed in Consumer Banking, and includes $24.7 billion of PPP loans outstanding at September 30, 2020. Excluding PPP, credit card-related products were 51 percent and 52 percent of the U.S. small business commercial portfolio at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Of the U.S. small business commercial net charge-offs, 93 percent were credit card-related products for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to 92 percent and 95 percent for the same periods in 2019. 

Nonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity 

Table 33 presents the nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019. Nonperforming loans do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option. During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, nonperforming commercial loans and leases increased $694 million to $2.2 billion, primarily driven by the impact of COVID-19. At September 30, 2020, 85 percent of commercial nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties were secured and 63 percent were contractually current. Commercial nonperforming loans were carried at 78 percent of their unpaid principal balance before consideration of the allowance for loan and lease losses, as the carrying value of these loans has been reduced to the estimated collateral value less costs to sell.

(3) Commercial loans and leases may be returned to performing status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected, or when the loan otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection. TDRs are generally classified as performing after a sustained period of demonstrated payment performance. 

(4) Outstanding commercial loans exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. 

Table 34 presents our commercial TDRs by product type and performing status. U.S. small business commercial TDRs are comprised of renegotiated small business card loans and small business loans. The renegotiated small business card loans are not classified as nonperforming as they are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days 

past due. For more information on our loan modification programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which are not TDRs, see Executive Summary - Recent Developments &#8211; COVID-19 Pandemic on page 3 and Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Industry Concentrations 

Table 35 presents commercial committed and utilized credit exposure by industry and the total net credit default protection purchased to cover the funded and unfunded portions of certain credit exposures. Our commercial credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of industries. Total commercial committed exposure decreased $21.7 billion, or two percent, during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 to $1.0 trillion. The decrease in commercial committed exposure was concentrated in the Asset managers and funds, Global commercial banks, Utilities, and Pharmaceuticals and biotechnology industry sectors. Decreases were partially offset by increased exposure to the Automobiles and components and the Healthcare equipment and services industry sectors. 

For information on industry limits, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management - Industry Concentrations in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Asset managers and funds, our largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $97.5 billion, decreased $12.6 

billion, or 11 percent, during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. 

Real estate, our second largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $95.3 billion, decreased $1.1 billion, or one percent, during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. For more information on the commercial real estate and related portfolios, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management &#8211; Commercial Real Estate on page 39. 

Capital goods, our third largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $83.2 billion, increased $2.3 billion, or three percent, during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 with the increase largely occurring in the machinery, aerospace and defense, and building products categories, partially offset by a decrease in trading companies and distributors, construction and engineering, and industrial conglomerates. 

Given the widespread impact the COVID-19 pandemic is having on the U.S. and global economy, a number of industries have been and continue to be adversely impacted. We continue to monitor all industries, particularly higher risk industries which 

41 Bank of America 

are experiencing or could experience a more significant impact to their financial condition. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has also placed significant stress on global demand for oil, resulting in a steep decline in prices. Our energy-related committed exposure decreased $1.8 billion, or five percent, during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 to $34.5 

billion, driven by declines in exploration and production, energy equipment and services and refining and marketing exposure offset, in part, by an increase in our integrated client exposure. For more information on COVID-19, see Executive Summary - Recent Developments &#8211; COVID-19 Pandemic on page 3.

Risk Mitigation 

We purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain credit exposures. To lower the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, we may add credit exposure within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection. 

At September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, net notional credit default protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, was $5.2 billion and $3.3 billion. We recorded net losses on these positions of $104 million and $106 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to net losses of $15 million and $93 million for the same periods in 2019. The gains and losses on these instruments were offset by gains and losses on the related exposures. The Value-at-Risk (VaR) results for these 

exposures are included in the fair value option portfolio information in Table 41. For more information, see Trading Risk Management on page 46.

Non-U.S. Portfolio 

Our non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios are subject to country risk. We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes in government policies. A risk management framework is in place to measure, monitor and manage non-U.S. risk and exposures. In addition to the direct risk of doing business in a country, we also are exposed to indirect country risks (e.g., related to the collateral received on secured financing transactions or related to client clearing activities). These indirect exposures are managed in the normal course of business through credit, market and operational risk governance, rather than through country risk governance. 

Table 38 presents our 20 largest non-U.S. country exposures at September 30, 2020. These exposures accounted for 91 percent and 88 percent of our total non-U.S. exposure at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Net country exposure for these 20 countries increased $37.9 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The majority of the increase was due to higher deposits with central banks in Germany and Japan.

Our largest non-U.S. country exposure at September 30, 2020 was the U.K. with net exposure of $55.0 billion, which represents an $813 million decrease from December 31, 2019. Our second largest non-U.S. country exposure was Germany with net exposure of $50.1 billion at September 30, 2020, a $19.2 billion increase from December 31, 2019. The increase in Germany was primarily driven by an increase in deposits with the central bank. 

In light of the global COVID-19 pandemic, we are monitoring our non-U.S. exposure closely, particularly in countries where restrictions on certain activities, in an attempt to contain the spread and impact of the virus, have affected and will likely 

continue to adversely affect economic activity. We are managing the impact to our international business operations as part of our overall response framework and are taking actions to manage exposure carefully in impacted regions while supporting the needs of our clients. The magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its full impact on the global economy continue to be highly uncertain. The impact of COVID-19 could have an adverse impact on the global economy for a prolonged period of time. For more information on how the COVID-19 pandemic may affect our operations, see Executive Summary - Recent Developments &#8211; COVID-19 Pandemic on page 3 and Part II, Item 1A.

Allowance for Credit Losses 

On January 1, 2020, the Corporation adopted the new accounting standard that requires the measurement of the allowance for credit losses to be based on management&#8217;s best estimate of lifetime ECL inherent in the Corporation&#8217;s relevant financial assets. Upon adoption of the new accounting standard, the Corporation recorded a net increase of $3.3 billion in the allowance for credit losses which was comprised of a net increase of $2.9 billion in the allowance for loan and lease losses and an increase of $310 million in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The net increase was primarily driven by a $3.1 billion increase related to the credit card portfolio. 

The allowance for credit losses further increased by $8.0 billion from January 1, 2020 to $21.5 billion at September 30, 2020, which included a $5.2 billion increase in the commercial portfolio and a $2.8 billion increase in the consumer portfolio. The increases were driven by deterioration in the economic outlook resulting from the impact of COVID-19. Assuming the macroeconomic outlook does not deteriorate further, we do not expect to increase the level of the allowance for credit losses in the fourth quarter of 2020. The following table presents an allocation of the allowance for credit losses by product type for September 30, 2020, January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2019 (prior to the adoption of the CECL accounting standard).

Net charge-offs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 were $972 million and $3.2 billion compared to $811 million and $2.7 billion for the same periods in 2019 driven by increases in commercial losses. The provision for credit losses increased $610 million to $1.4 billion, and $8.6 billion to $11.3 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. The allowance for credit losses included a reserve build of $417 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020, driven by COVID-19 impacted industries, such as travel and entertainment, and a reserve build of $8.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 primarily due to the deterioration in the economic outlook resulting from the impact of COVID-19 on both the consumer and commercial portfolios. The provision for credit losses for the consumer portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, decreased $269 million to $295 million and increased $3.0 billion to $5.0 billion 

for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. The provision for credit losses for the commercial portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, increased $879 million to $1.1 billion and $5.6 billion to $6.3 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. 

The following table presents a rollforward of the allowance for credit losses, including certain loan and allowance ratios for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, noting that measurement of the allowance for credit losses for 2019 was based on management&#8217;s estimate of probable incurred losses. For more information on the Corporation&#8217;s credit loss accounting policies and activity related to the allowance for credit losses, see Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 5 &#8211; Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Market Risk Management 

For more information on our market risk management process, see Market Risk Management in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions may adversely impact the value of assets or liabilities, or otherwise negatively impact earnings. This risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations, primarily within our Global Markets segment. We are also exposed to these risks in other areas of the Corporation (e.g., our ALM activities). In the event of market stress, these risks could have a material impact on our results. 

We have been affected, and expect to continue to be affected, by market stress resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic that began in the first quarter of 2020. For more information on the effects of the pandemic, see Executive Summary - Recent Developments &#8211; COVID-19 Pandemic on page 3. 

Trading Risk Management 

To evaluate risks in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of revenues generated by individual positions as well as portfolios of positions. VaR is a common statistic used to measure market risk. Our primary VaR statistic is equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level, which means that for a VaR with a one-day holding period, there should not be losses in excess of VaR, on average, 99 out of 100 trading days. 

Table 41 presents the total market-based portfolio VaR which is the combination of the total covered positions (and less liquid trading positions) portfolio and the fair value option portfolio. For more information on the market risk VaR for trading activities, see Trading Risk Management in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

The total market-based portfolio VaR results in Table 41 include market risk to which we are exposed from all business segments, excluding credit valuation adjustment (CVA), DVA and related hedges. The majority of this portfolio is within the Global Markets segment. 

Table 41 presents period-end, average, high and low daily trading VaR for the three months ended September 30, 2020, June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019 using a 99 percent confidence level, as well as average daily trading VaR for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019. The amounts disclosed in Table 41 and Table 42 align to the view of covered positions used in the Basel 3 capital calculations. Foreign exchange and commodity positions are always considered covered positions, regardless of trading or banking treatment for the trade, except for structural foreign currency positions that are excluded with prior regulatory approval. 

The average of total covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio VaR increased for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the prior quarter primarily due to a decrease in portfolio diversification.

Therefore the impact from less liquid exposures and the amount of portfolio diversification, which is the difference between the total portfolio and the sum of the individual components, is not relevant.

The graph below presents the daily covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio VaR for the previous five quarters, corresponding to the data in Table 41. Peak VaR in mid-March 2020 was driven by increased market realized volatility and higher implied volatilities. 

Additional VaR statistics produced within our single VaR model are provided in Table 42 at the same level of detail as in Table 41. Evaluating VaR with additional statistics allows for an increased understanding of the risks in the portfolio as the historical market data used in the VaR calculation does not necessarily follow a predefined statistical distribution. Table 42 presents average trading VaR statistics at 99 percent and 95 

percent confidence levels for the three months ended September 30, 2020, June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019. The increase in VaR for the 99 percent confidence level for the three months ended September 30, 2020 was primarily due to COVID-19 related market volatility, which impacted the 99 percent VaR average more severely than the 95 percent VaR average.

Backtesting 

The accuracy of the VaR methodology is evaluated by backtesting, which compares the daily VaR results, utilizing a one-day holding period, against a comparable subset of trading revenue. For more information on our backtesting process, see Trading Risk Management &#8211; Backtesting in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2020, there were no days where this subset of trading revenue had losses that exceeded our total covered portfolio VaR, utilizing a one-day holding period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, seven days with losses exceeded total covered portfolio VaR. 

Total Trading-related Revenue 

Total trading-related revenue, excluding brokerage fees, and CVA, DVA and funding valuation adjustment gains (losses), represents the total amount earned from trading positions, 

including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. For more information, see Trading Risk Management &#8211; Total Trading-related Revenue in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

The following histogram is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2020 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020. During the three months ended September 30, 2020, positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 100 percent of the trading days, of which 88 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million. This compares to the three months ended June 30, 2020 where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 100 percent of the trading days, of which 95 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million. During the three months ended March 31, 2020, positive trading-related 

47 Bank of America 

revenue was recorded for 94 percent of the trading days, of which 89 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million. 

Trading Portfolio Stress Testing 

Because the very nature of a VaR model suggests results can exceed our estimates and it is dependent on a limited historical window, we also stress test our portfolio using scenario analysis. This analysis estimates the change in the value of our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements.

The following discussion presents net interest income for banking book activities. For more information, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Table 43 presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. 

Table 43 Forward Rates September 30, 2020 &#160; Federal Funds Three-month LIBOR 10-Year Swap Spot rates 0.25 &#160; % 0.23 &#160; % 0.71 &#160; % 12-month forward rates 0.25 &#160; 0.19 &#160; 0.81 &#160; December 31, 2019 Spot rates 1.75 % 1.91 % 1.90 % 12-month forward rates 1.50 1.62 1.92 

Table 44 shows the pretax impact to forecasted net interest income over the next 12 months from September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 resulting from instantaneous parallel and non-parallel shocks to the market-based forward curve. Periodically we evaluate the scenarios presented so that they are meaningful in the context of the current rate environment. The interest rate scenarios also assume U.S. dollar rates are floored at zero. 

In the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet increased in both up-rate and down-rate scenarios primarily due to higher deposit balances. We continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel upward move in interest rates with the majority of that impact coming from the short end of the yield curve. Additionally, higher interest rates impact the fair value of debt securities and, accordingly, for debt 

securities classified as AFS, may adversely affect OCI and thus capital levels under the Basel 3 capital rules. Under instantaneous upward parallel shifts, the near-term adverse impact to Basel 3 capital is reduced over time by offsetting positive impacts to net interest income. For more information on Basel 3, see Capital Management &#8211; Regulatory Capital on page 24.

The sensitivity analysis in Table 44 assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shocks and does not assume any change in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates. As part of our ALM activities, we use securities, certain residential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity. 

The behavior of our deposits portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income. The sensitivity analysis in Table 44 assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce our benefit in those scenarios. 

Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative Contracts 

Interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts are utilized in our ALM activities and serve as an efficient tool to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk. We use derivatives to hedge the variability in cash flows or changes in fair value on our balance sheet due to interest rate and foreign exchange components. For more information on our hedging activities, see Note 3 &#8211; Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For more information on interest rate contracts and risk management, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

We use interest rate derivative instruments to hedge the variability in the cash flows of our assets and liabilities and other forecasted transactions (collectively referred to as cash flow hedges). The net results on both open and terminated cash flow hedge derivative instruments recorded in accumulated OCI 

Bank of America 48 

were a gain of $557 million and a loss of $496 million, on a pretax basis, at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. These gains and losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings in the same period as the hedged cash flows affect earnings and will decrease income or increase expense on the respective hedged cash flows. Assuming no change in open cash flow derivative hedge positions and no changes in prices or interest rates beyond what is implied in forward yield curves at September 30, 2020, the after-tax net gains are expected to be reclassified into earnings as follows: a gain of $191 million within the next year, a gain of $352 million in years two through five, a loss of $79 million in years six through ten, with the remaining loss of $56 million thereafter. For more information on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, see Note 3 &#8211; Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

We hedge our net investment in non-U.S. operations determined to have functional currencies other than the U.S. 

dollar using forward foreign exchange contracts that typically settle in less than 180 days, cross-currency basis swaps and foreign exchange options. We recorded net after-tax losses on derivatives in accumulated OCI associated with net investment hedges which were offset by gains on our net investments in consolidated non-U.S. entities at September 30, 2020. 

Table 45 presents derivatives utilized in our ALM activities and shows the notional amount, fair value, weighted-average receive-fixed and pay-fixed rates, expected maturity and average estimated durations of our open ALM derivatives at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. These amounts do not include derivative hedges on our MSRs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the fair value of receive-fixed interest rate swaps increased while pay-fixed interest swaps decreased, primarily driven by lower swap rates on hedges of U.S. dollar long-term debt.

Mortgage Banking Risk Management 

We originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. We determine whether loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate. 

Changes in interest rates impact the value of interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and the related residential first mortgage LHFS, as well as the value of the MSRs. Because the interest rate risks of these hedged items offset, we combine them into one overall hedged item with one combined economic hedge portfolio consisting of derivative contracts and securities. For more information on IRLCs and the related residential mortgage LHFS, see Mortgage Banking Risk Management in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, we recorded gains of $85 million and $313 million related to the change in fair value of the MSRs, IRLCs and LHFS, net of gains and losses on the hedge portfolio, compared to gains of $78 million and $217 million for the same periods in 2019. 

Complex Accounting Estimates 

Our significant accounting principles are essential in understanding the MD&#38;A. Many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. We have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments. For more information, see Complex Accounting Estimates in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as noted below under Allowance for Credit Losses, there have not been any material updates to our complex accounting estimates as disclosed in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

On January 1, 2020, the Corporation adopted the new accounting standard that requires the measurement of the allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, to be based on management&#8217;s best estimate of lifetime ECL inherent in the Corporation's relevant financial assets. 

The Corporation's estimate of lifetime ECL includes the use of quantitative models that incorporate forward-looking 

macroeconomic scenarios that are applied over the contractual life of the loan portfolios, adjusted for expected prepayments and borrower-controlled extension options. These macroeconomic scenarios include variables that have historically been key drivers of increases and decreases in credit losses. These variables include, but are not limited to, unemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product levels, corporate bond spreads and long-term interest rate forecasts. As any one economic outlook is inherently uncertain, the Corporation leverages multiple scenarios. The scenarios that are chosen each quarter and the amount of weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors including recent economic events, leading economic indicators, views of internal and third-party economists and industry trends. 

The Corporation also includes qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but, in the Corporation's assessment, may not be adequately represented in the economic assumptions described above. For example, factors that the Corporation considers include changes in lending policies and procedures, business conditions, the nature and size of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements, among others. Further, the Corporation considers the inherent uncertainty in quantitative models that are built on historical data. 

The allowance for credit losses can also be impacted by unanticipated changes in asset quality of the portfolio, such as increases in risk rating downgrades in our commercial portfolio, deterioration in borrower delinquencies or credit scores in our credit card portfolio or increases in LTVs in our consumer real estate portfolio. In addition, while we have incorporated our estimated impact of COVID-19 into our allowance for credit losses, the ultimate impact of the pandemic is still unknown, including how long economic activities will be impacted and what effect the unprecedented levels of government fiscal and monetary actions will have on the economy and our credit losses. 

As described above, the process to determine the allowance for credit losses requires numerous estimates and assumptions, some of which require a high degree of judgment and are often interrelated. Changes in the estimates and assumptions can result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses. Our process for determining the allowance for credit losses is further discussed in Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 5 &#8211; Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
