 Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Bank of America Corporation (the &#8220;Corporation&#8221;) and its management may make certain statements that constitute &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;targets,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;hopes,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221; &#8220;intends,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;goals,&#8221; &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;continue&#8221; and other similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;might,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;would&#8221; and &#8220;could.&#8221; Forward-looking statements represent the Corporation&#8217;s current expectations, plans or forecasts of its future results, revenues, expenses, efficiency ratio, capital measures, strategy, and future business and economic conditions more generally, and other future matters. These statements are not guarantees of future results or performance and involve certain known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and are often beyond the Corporation&#8217;s control. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, any of these forward-looking statements. 

You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement and should consider the following uncertainties and risks, as well as the risks and uncertainties more fully discussed under Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in any of the Corporation&#8217;s subsequent Securities and Exchange Commission filings: the Corporation&#8217;s potential judgments, claims, damages, penalties, fines and reputational damage resulting from pending or future litigation and regulatory and government actions, including as a result of our participation in and execution of government programs related to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic; the possibility that the Corporation&#8217;s future liabilities may be in excess of its recorded liability and estimated range of possible loss for litigation, regulatory, and representations and warranties exposures; the possibility that the Corporation could face increased servicing, fraud, indemnity, contribution or other claims from one or more counterparties, including trustees, purchasers of loans, underwriters, issuers, monolines, private-label and other investors, or other parties involved in securitizations; the Corporation&#8217;s ability to resolve representations and warranties repurchase and related claims, including claims brought by investors or trustees seeking to avoid the statute of limitations for repurchase claims; the risks related to the discontinuation of the London Interbank Offered Rate and other reference rates, including increased expenses and litigation and the effectiveness of hedging strategies; uncertainties about the financial stability and growth rates of non-U.S. jurisdictions, the risk that those jurisdictions may face difficulties servicing their sovereign debt, and related stresses on financial markets, currencies and trade, and the Corporation&#8217;s exposures to such risks, including direct, indirect and operational; the impact of U.S. and global interest rates, inflation, currency exchange rates, economic conditions, trade policies and tensions, including tariffs, and potential geopolitical instability; the impact of the interest rate environment on the Corporation&#8217;s business, financial condition and results of operations; the possibility that 

&#160;

future credit losses may be higher than currently expected due to changes in economic assumptions, customer behavior, adverse developments with respect to U.S. or global economic conditions and other uncertainties; the Corporation&#8217;s ability to achieve its expense targets and expectations regarding net interest income, provision for credit losses, net charge-offs, effective tax rate, loan growth or other projections; adverse changes to the Corporation&#8217;s credit ratings from the major credit rating agencies; an inability to access capital markets or maintain deposits or borrowing costs; estimates of the fair value and other accounting values, subject to impairment assessments, of certain of the Corporation&#8217;s assets and liabilities; the estimated or actual impact of changes in accounting standards or assumptions in applying those standards; uncertainty regarding the content, timing and impact of regulatory capital and liquidity requirements; the impact of adverse changes to total loss-absorbing capacity requirements, stress capital buffer requirements and/or global systemically important bank surcharges; the potential impact of actions of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System on the Corporation&#8217;s capital plans; the effect of regulations, other guidance or additional information on the impact from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; the impact of implementation and compliance with U.S. and international laws, regulations and regulatory interpretations, including, but not limited to, recovery and resolution planning requirements, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation assessments, the Volcker Rule, fiduciary standards, derivatives regulations and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and any similar or related rules and regulations; a failure or disruption in or breach of the Corporation&#8217;s operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, including as a result of cyber attacks or campaigns; the impact on the Corporation&#8217;s business, financial condition and results of operations from the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union; the impact of any future federal government shutdown and uncertainty regarding the federal government&#8217;s debt limit or changes to the U.S. presidential administration and Congress; the emergence of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, including the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the U.S. and/or global economy, financial market conditions and our business, results of operations and financial condition; the impact of natural disasters, military conflict, terrorism or other geopolitical events; and other matters. 

Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Corporation undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that arise after the date the forward-looking statement was made.

Recent Developments 

Capital Management 

I n June 2020, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) notified BHCs of their 2020 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) supervisory stress test results. Based on our results, we will be subject to a preliminary 2.5 percent stress capital buffer (SCB) for the period beginning October 1, 2020 and ending on September 30, 2021. The Federal Reserve plans to finalize the SCB for all BHCs by August 31, 2020. For more information on SCB, see Capital Management on page 23 . 

The Federal Reserve also announced that due to economic uncertainty resulting from the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, all large banks will be required to suspend share repurchase programs in the third quarter of 2020, except for repurchases to offset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans, and limit dividends to existing rates that do not exceed the average of the last four quarters&#8217; net income. Large banks will also be required to resubmit and update their capital plans later this year based on instructions that the Federal Reserve will provide. The Federal Reserve plans to conduct additional analysis to assess the Corporation's capital plans and will review capital preservation measures on a quarter-by-quarter basis. 

&#160;

The Federal Reserve&#8217;s directive regarding share repurchases aligns with our decision to voluntarily suspend repurchases in the first quarter of 2020 from the date of the announcement on March 15, 2020 through the end of the second quarter of 2020. The suspension of our repurchases did not include repurchases to offset shares awarded under our equity-based compensation plans, for which we repurchased $286 million of common stock during the second quarter of 2020 pursuant to the Board's repurchase authorization under our 2019 CCAR capital plan. 

On July 22, 2020, the Board of Directors (the Board) declared a quarterly common stock dividend at the existing rate of $0.18 per share. We intend to maintain the quarterly common stock dividend at this rate until further notice, subject to approval by the Board. We will also continue our current suspension of common stock repurchases in the third quarter of 2020, except for repurchases to offset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans. 

For more information on our capital resources, see Capital Management on page 23 . 

COVID-19 Pandemic 

In the first quarter of 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. In an attempt to contain the spread and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and limitations on business activity have been implemented. Additionally, there has been a sharp decline in global economic activity, reduced U.S. and global economic output and a significant deterioration in macroeconomic conditions in the U.S. and globally. This has resulted in, among other things, high rates of unemployment and underemployment and caused volatility and disruptions in the global financial markets, including the energy and commodity markets. Although some restrictive measures have been eased in certain areas, many of the restrictive measures remain in place or have been reinstated, and in some cases additional restrictive measures are being implemented. Businesses, market participants, our counterparties and clients, and the U.S. and global economies have been negatively impacted and are likely to be so for an extended period of time, as there remains significant uncertainty about the timing and strength of an economic recovery. 

In response to the pandemic, the Corporation has implemented protocols and processes to execute its business continuity plans and help protect its employees and support its clients. The Corporation is managing its response to the COVID-19 pandemic according to its Enterprise Response Framework, which invokes centralized management of the crisis event and the integration of its response. The CEO and key members of the Corporation&#8217;s management team meet daily with co-leaders of the Executive Response Team, which is composed of senior executives across the Corporation, to help drive decisions, communications, and consistency of response across all businesses and functions. We are also coordinating with global, regional and local authorities and health experts, including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization. 

Additionally, we have implemented a number of measures to assist our employees, clients and the communities we serve, including the following: 

3 &#160; Bank of America 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Employees 

We are providing support to our teammates to help promote the health and safety of our employees, including: 

&#9679; 

Monitoring guidance from the CDC, medical boards and health authorities and sharing such guidance with our employees. 

&#9679; 

Operating our businesses from remote locations and leveraging our business continuity plans and capabilities. The Corporation has globally implemented a work-from-home posture, which has resulted in a substantial majority of our employees working from home, and pre-planned contingency strategies for site-based operations for our remaining employees. We continue to evaluate our continuity plans and work-from-home strategy in an effort to best protect the health and safety of our employees. 

&#9679; 

Providing access to various benefits and resources related to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Clients 

We have taken measures to leverage our business continuity plans and capabilities to continue to service our clients and meet our clients&#8217; financial needs, including: 

&#9679; 

Offering assistance to our commercial, consumer and small business clients affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which includes payment deferrals, refunds of certain fees, pausing foreclosure sales, evictions and repossessions, and continuing to provide access to credit and the important financial services on which our clients rely. For more information on payment deferrals, see Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements . 

&#9679; 

Participating in the programs created by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES Act) and Federal Reserve lending programs for businesses, including originating Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans. Through the second quarter of 2020, we funded approximately 334,000 PPP loans totaling $25.1 billion, which were recorded in the Consumer , GWIM and Global Banking segments. For more information, see Credit Risk Management on page 31 and Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements . 

&#9679; 

Providing access to important financial resources, including 24/7 access to mobile and online banking, with no limits on cash withdrawals, and virtual connection to advisors. 

&#160;

Community partners 

We have supported the communities where we live and work by engaging to help those affected through initiatives, including: 

&#9679; 

Committed $100 million to local communities to purchase medical supplies, food and other priorities. 

&#9679; 

Committed $250 million in capital to community development financial institutions to fund loans they extend through the PPP. 

&#9679; 

Issued a $1 billion, four-year corporate social bond to support the fight against COVID-19, the first such offering by a U.S. commercial bank. 

&#9679; 

Made a $1 billion, four-year pledge of additional support to address economic and racial inequality accelerated by the global pandemic. The programs will be focused on assisting people and communities of color who have experienced a greater impact from the health crisis. 

We will continue to manage the increased operational risk related to the execution of our business continuity plans in accordance with our Enterprise Response Framework, Risk Framework and Operational Risk Management Program. For more information, see Managing Risk on page 23 . 

Loan Modifications 

The Corporation has implemented various consumer and commercial loan modification programs to provide its borrowers relief from the economic impacts of COVID-19. Based on guidance in the CARES Act that the Corporation adopted, COVID-19 related modifications to consumer and commercial loans that were current as of December 31, 2019 are exempt from troubled debt restructuring (TDR) classification under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). In addition, the bank regulatory agencies issued interagency guidance stating that COVID-19 related short-term modifications (i.e., six months or less) granted to consumer or commercial loans that were current as of the loan modification program implementation date are not TDRs. For more information, see Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 5 &#8211; Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements . 

The following table provides a summary of the percentage of our loans and loan balances with modifications in place as of July 23, 2020. The modifications were made in response to COVID-19 under payment deferral or forbearance programs, none of which are classified as TDRs. As of the date presented, loan balances of deferred consumer and small business accounts totaled $28.5 billion. Deferred commercial accounts, excluding small business, totaled $7.7 billion.

Statistics represent clients who have been given temporary deferment of principal and/or interest for a defined period of time. 

We have processed 1.8 million consumer deferral requests, of which 1.4 million were in place as of July 23, 2020. The largest number of processed deferrals has been for consumer and small business credit card holders, of which 85 percent were initiated in late March and April 2020. At the time the deferrals were requested, more than 95 percent of these customers were current. During the second quarter of 2020, approximately 61 percent of these customers have made at least one payment, and 33 percent have made a payment each month since being placed on deferral. 

Other Related Matters 

As part of our ongoing review of our financial condition in light of the pandemic, we evaluated goodwill and other intangibles and equity investments for potential impairment. Based upon our review as of June 30, 2020, no impairments have been recorded. For more information on goodwill, see Complex Accounting Estimates &#8211; Goodwill and Intangible Assets on page 50 and Note 7 &#8211; Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Given the significant uncertainty regarding the duration and further spread of COVID-19 and rapidly evolving economic effects and social impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the future direct and indirect impact on our businesses, results of operations and financial condition remain highly uncertain. Should current economic conditions persist or continue to deteriorate, we expect that this macroeconomic environment will have a continued adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations and could have an effect on our financial condition. For more information on how the risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition, see Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors on page 104 . 

LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rates 

As previously disclosed, to facilitate an orderly transition from Interbank Offered Rates (IBORs) and other benchmark rates to alternative reference rates (ARRs), the Corporation has established an enterprise-wide program to identify, assess and monitor risks associated with the expected discontinuation or unavailability of benchmarks, including the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). As part of this program, the Corporation continues to identify, assess and monitor risks associated with the expected discontinuation or unavailability of LIBOR and other 

&#160;

benchmarks, and evaluate and address documentation and contractual mechanics of outstanding IBOR-based products and contracts that may mature after LIBOR is no longer deemed a representative benchmark and new and potential future ARR-based products and contracts to achieve operational readiness. This program, which is led by the Corporation's Chief Operating Officer, includes active involvement of senior management and regular reports to the Enterprise Risk Committee. The program is structured to address the Corporation's industry and regulatory engagement, client and financial contract changes, internal and external communications, technology and operations modifications, introduction of new products, migration of existing clients, and program strategy and governance. As the markets for ARRs continue to grow, the Corporation continues to monitor the development and usage of ARRs, including the Secured Overnight Financing Rate. Additionally, the Corporation continues to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on the market and industry transition to ARRs, including the readiness of other market participants and third-party vendors, and impacted clients and their operational readiness to transition to ARRs. For more information on the expected replacement of LIBOR and other benchmark rates, see Executive Summary - Recent Developments - LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rates in the MD&#38;A and Item 1A. Risk Factors - Other of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more information about the Corporation's risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic, see Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors on page 104 . 

Merchant Services Joint Venture 

Prior to the third quarter of 2020, a significant portion of our merchant processing activity was performed by a joint venture in which we hold a 49 percent ownership interest. In 2019, we delivered notice of termination of the joint venture at the conclusion of its term in June 2020 to the joint venture partner. For more information, see Note 10 &#8211; Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Effective July 1, 2020, the Corporation received its share of the joint venture's merchant contracts and began providing merchant services for the customer relationships received. Beginning in the third quarter of 2020, merchant revenue and the related noninterest expense will be recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income and are not expected to be material. 

5 &#160; Bank of America 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Financial Highlights 

Effective January 1, 2020, we adopted the new accounting standard on current expected credit losses (CECL), under which the allowance is measured based on management&#8217;s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses (ECL). Prior-year periods presented reflect measurement of the allowance based on management&#8217;s estimate of probable incurred credit losses. For more information, see Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements .

Return on average tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity is a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information and a corresponding reconciliation to the most closely related financial measures defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 51 . 

Net income was $3.5 billion and $7.5 billion , or $0.37 and $0.77 per diluted share, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to $7.3 billion and $14.7 billion , or $0.74 and $1.45 per diluted share, for the same periods in 2019. The decline in net income was largely due to an increase in the provision for credit losses primarily due to the weaker economic outlook related to COVID&#8208;19, and to a lesser extent, lower revenue and an increase in noninterest expense. 

Total assets increased $307.6 billion from December 31, 2019 to $2.7 trillion primarily driven by higher federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell and higher cash and cash equivalents as a result of elevated deposit balances being deployed as short-term investments. 

Total liabilities increased $306.8 billion from December 31, 2019 to $2.5 trillion primarily driven by higher deposit inflows resulting from government stimulus actions, lower consumer spending, and client responses to market volatility as clients improved their liquidity positions. Additionally, long-term debt 

&#160;

increased due to debt issuances and a debt basis adjustment primarily due to lower interest rates. 

Shareholders&#8217; equity increased $827 million from December 31, 2019 primarily due to net income and market value increases on debt securities, partially offset by returns of capital to shareholders through common stock repurchases and common and preferred stock dividends as well as the impact of the adoption of the new credit loss accounting standard. 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income decreased $1.3 billion to $10.8 billion , and $1.6 billion to $23.0 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. Net interest yield on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis decreased 57 basis points (bps) to 1.87 percent , and 39 bps to 2.09 percent for the same periods. The decrease in net interest income was primarily driven by lower asset yields from the decline in interest rates, partially offset by reduced deposit and funding costs as well as 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Bank of America &#160; 6 

loan and deposit growth. Based on the forward interest rate curve and other relevant assumptions as of June 30, 2020, we expect net interest income to decline modestly in the third quarter of 2020 as compared to the second quarter of 2020. For more

Noninterest income increased $583 million to $11.5 billion , and $591 million to $22.1 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. The following highlights the significant changes. 

&#9679; 

Card income decreased $197 million and $300 million primarily driven by lower levels of consumer spending due to the impact of COVID-19 . 

&#9679; 

Service charges decreased $341 million and $277 million primarily due to lower overdraft charge rates and client activity due to the impact of COVID-19. 

&#9679; 

Investment and brokerage services income decreased $48 million for the three-month period primarily due to lower market valuations and assets under management (AUM) pricing, partially offset by the benefit of positive AUM flows. For the six-month period, there was an increase of $350 million primarily due to higher client transactional activity, higher market valuations and AUM flows, partially offset by declines in AUM pricing. 

&#9679; 

Investment banking fees increased $788 million and $912 million due to higher debt and equity underwriting fees and higher advisory fees. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Market making and similar activities increased $106 million and $145 million . For the three-month period the improvement was primarily due to increased client activity and market recoveries from the end of the prior quarter, partially offset by lower income in equity derivatives from a weaker trading performance. The increase in the six-month period was primarily driven by higher client activity, partially offset by valuation adjustments in credit-sensitive products. 

&#9679; 

Other income increased $275 million for the three-month period and decreased $239 million for the six-month period. The increase was primarily due to a $704 million gain on sales of certain mortgage loans, partially offset by certain valuation adjustments. The decrease in the six-month period was primarily due to net unrealized losses in the fair value option and leveraged finance portfolios. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses increased $4.3 billion to $5.1 billion , and $8.0 billion to $9.9 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019, primarily driven by increased ECL due to a weaker economic outlook related to COVID-19.

The effective tax rates for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 were driven by our recurring tax preference benefits, primarily consisting of tax credits from investments in affordable housing and renewable energy, aligning with our responsible growth strategy to address global sustainability challenges. The six-month effective rates also included tax benefits from deductions associated with share-based compensation. The declines in the effective tax rates for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 were driven by the impact of our recurring tax preference benefits on the lower levels of pretax income. We expect the effective tax rate for the rest of 2020 to be approximately 11 percent, excluding the change in U.K. tax law discussed below and other unusual items. Absent these tax credits, we would expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 25 percent. 

On July 22, 2020, the U.K. enacted a change in its tax rates under which the Corporation will record an income tax benefit of approximately $700 million in the third quarter of 2020. For more information, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Supplemental Financial Data 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

In this Form 10-Q, we present certain non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items or otherwise include components that differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are provided as additional useful information to assess our financial condition, results of operations (including period-to-period operating performance) or compliance with prospective regulatory requirements. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may not be defined or calculated the same way as non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. 

We view net interest income and related ratios and analyses on an FTE basis, which when presented on a consolidated basis are non-GAAP financial measures. To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 21 percent and a representative state tax rate. Net interest yield, which measures the basis points we earn over the cost of funds, utilizes net interest income on an FTE basis. We believe that presentation of these items on an FTE basis allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practices. 

We may present certain key performance indicators and ratios excluding certain items (e.g., debit valuation adjustment (DVA) gains (losses)) which result in non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that the presentation of measures that exclude these items is useful because such measures provide additional information to assess the underlying operational performance and trends of our businesses and to allow better comparison of period-to-period operating performance. 

&#160;

We also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible equity represents shareholders&#8217; equity or common shareholders&#8217; equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)), net of related deferred tax liabilities ("adjusted" shareholders' equity or common shareholders' equity). These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models use both return on average tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity and return on average tangible shareholders&#8217; equity as key measures to support our overall growth objectives. These ratios are as follows: 

&#9679; 

Return on average tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity measures our net income applicable to common shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average common shareholders&#8217; equity. The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders&#8217; equity divided by total tangible assets. 

&#9679; 

Return on average tangible shareholders' equity measures our net income as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders&#8217; equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders&#8217; equity divided by total tangible assets. 

&#9679; 

Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders&#8217; equity divided by ending common shares outstanding. 

We believe that the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. Tangible book value per common share provides additional useful information about the level of tangible assets in relation to outstanding shares of common stock. 

The aforementioned supplemental data and performance measures are presented in Tables 6 and 7 . 

For more information on the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 51 . 

Key Performance Indicators 

We present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance indicators (key performance indicators) that management uses when assessing our consolidated and/or segment results. We believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information about our underlying operational performance and trends. These key performance indicators (KPIs) may not be defined or calculated in the same way as similar KPIs used by other companies. For information on how these metrics are defined, see Key Metrics on page 103 . 

Our consolidated key performance indicators, which include various equity and credit metrics, are presented in Table 2 on page 6 and/or Table 6 on page 9 . 

For information on key segment performance metrics, see Business Segment Operations on page 12 .

Business Segment Operations 

Segment Description and Basis of Presentation 

We report our results of operations through the following four business segments: Consumer Banking, GWIM, Global Banking and Global Markets , with the remaining operations recorded in All Other . We manage our segments and report their results on an FTE basis. For more information, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 

We periodically review capital allocated to our businesses and allocate capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes. We utilize a methodology that considers the effect of regulatory capital requirements in addition to internal risk-based capital models. Our internal risk-based capital models use a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segment&#8217;s credit, market, interest rate, business and operational risk components. For more information on the nature of these risks, see Managing Risk on page 23 . The capital allocated to the business segments 

&#160;

is referred to as allocated capital. Allocated equity in the reporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital for the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the reporting unit. For more information, see Note 7 &#8211; Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements . 

For more information on our presentation of financial information on an FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 8 , and for reconciliations to consolidated total revenue, net income and period-end total assets, see Note 17 &#8211; Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements . 

Key Performance Indicators 

We present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance indicators that management uses when evaluating segment results. We believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information about our segments&#8217; operational performance, customer trends and business growth.

Consumer Banking, which is comprised of Deposits and Consumer Lending, offers a diversified range of credit, banking and investment products and services to consumers and small businesses. For more information about Consumer Banking, including our Deposits and Consumer Lending businesses, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 

Consumer Banking Results 

Three-Month Comparison 

Net income for Consumer Banking decreased $3.2 billion to $71 million primarily due to higher provision for credit losses and lower revenue. 

Net interest income decreased $1.1 billion to $6.0 billion primarily due to lower interest rates, partially offset by higher deposit and loan balances. Noninterest income decreased $741 million to $1.9 billion driven by a decline in service charges and card income primarily due to fewer overdrafts and lower client activity, as well as lower other income driven by the allocation of asset and liability management (ALM) results. 

The provision for credit losses increased $2.1 billion to $3.0 billion primarily due to the weaker economic outlook related to COVID-19. Noninterest expense increased $321 million to $4.7 billion primarily driven by incremental expense to support customers and employees during COVID-19, as well as the cost 

&#160;

of increased client activity and continued investments for business growth. 

The return on average allocated capital was one percent, down from 36 percent, driven by lower net income, and to a lesser extent, an increase in allocated capital. For information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 12 . 

Six-Month Comparison 

Net income for Consumer Banking decreased $4.7 billion to $1.9 billion primarily due to higher provision for credit losses and lower revenue. 

Net interest income decreased $1.4 billion to $12.9 billion and noninterest income decreased $1.0 billion to $4.1 billion . The declines were primarily driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion. 

The provision for credit losses increased $3.4 billion to $5.3 billion primarily due to the weaker economic outlook related to COVID-19. Noninterest expense increased $449 million to $9.2 billion primarily driven by incremental expense to support customers and employees during COVID-19, the cost of increased client activity, and continued investments for business growth, partially offset by improved productivity. 

The return on average allocated capital was 10 percent, down from 36 percent, driven by lower net income and, to a lesser extent, an increase in allocated capital. 

13 &#160; Bank of America 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Deposits 

Three-Month Comparison 

Net income for Deposits decreased $1.4 billion to $785 million driven by lower revenue. Net interest income declined $1.1 billion to $3.3 billion primarily due to lower interest rates, partially offset by growth in deposits. Noninterest income decreased $485 million to $763 million . The decline in noninterest income was primarily driven by lower service charges due to fewer overdrafts, fee waivers and lower client activity related to the impact of COVID-19 as well as lower other income due to the allocation of ALM results. 

The provision for credit losses increased $110 million to $154 million primarily due to the weaker economic outlook related to COVID-19. Noninterest expense increased $194 million to $2.9 billion driven by continued investments in the business and incremental expense to support customers and employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Average deposits increased $102.6 billion to $804.4 billion . The increase was driven by strong organic growth of $76.1 billion in checking and time deposits and $ 26.5 billion in traditional savings and money market savings. 

&#160;

Six-Month Comparison 

Net income for Deposits decreased $1.9 billion to $2.4 billion driven by lower revenue. Net interest income declined $1.4 billion to $7.2 billion primarily driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion. Noninterest income decreased $646 million to $1.8 billion primarily due to the same factors as described in the three-month discussion. 

The provision for credit losses increased $179 million to $269 million primarily due to the weaker economic outlook related to COVID-19. Noninterest expense increased $264 million to $5.6 billion due to the same factors as described in the three-month discussion. 

Average deposits increased $70.8 billion to $767.8 billion . The increase was driven by strong organic growth of $56.2 billion in checking and time deposits and $14.6 billion in traditional savings and money market savings. 

The following table provides key performance indicators for Deposits. Management uses these metrics, and we believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information to evaluate our deposit profitability and mobile/digital trends.

Consumer Lending 

Three-Month Comparison 

Net loss for Consumer Lending was $714 million , a decrease of $1.8 billion primarily due to higher provision for credit losses. Net interest income decreased $61 million to $2.7 billion driven by the allocation of ALM results, partially offset by loan growth. Noninterest income decreased $256 million to $1.1 billion primarily driven by lower card income due to lower client activity. 

The provision for credit losses increased $2.0 billion to $2.9 billion primarily due to the weaker economic outlook related to COVID-19. Noninterest expense increased $127 million to $1.9 billion primarily driven by investments in the business and 

&#160;

incremental expense to support customers and employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Average loans increased $25.2 billion to $316.2 billion primarily driven by an increase in residential mortgages.

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , the total credit card risk-adjusted margin increased 56 bps and 22 bps compared to the same periods in 2019 primarily due to a decrease in the proportion of customers who pay their balances in full each month. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , total credit card purchase volumes declined $16.6 billion to $53.7 billion , and $15.0 billion to $118.1 billion compared to the same periods in 2019 . Debit card purchase volumes declined $1.6 billion to $89.6 billion during the three months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 

&#160;

2019. The declines in credit card and debit card purchase volumes were driven by lower levels of consumer spending due to the impact of COVID-19. Debit card purchase volumes began to improve late in the second quarter of 2020 as businesses reopened and consumers used their cards for more essential spending, as well as retail, services and restaurant spending. For the six months ended June 30, 2020 , debit card purchase volumes increased $2.0 billion to $178.2 billion , driven by higher levels of consumer spending in the first quarter and again in June 2020.

GWIM consists of two primary businesses: Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management (MLGWM) and Bank of America Private Bank. For more information about GWIM , see Business Segment Operations in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 

Three-Month Comparison 

Net income for GWIM decreased $452 million to $624 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 due to lower revenue and higher provision for credit losses. The operating margin was 19 percent compared to 29 percent a year ago. 

Net interest income decreased $246 million to $1.4 billion due to the impact of lower interest rates, partially offset by the benefit of strong deposit and loan growth. 

Noninterest income, which primarily includes investment and brokerage services income, decreased $229 million to $3.0 billion . The decrease was primarily driven by lower transactional revenue, lower market valuations, and declines in AUM pricing, partially offset by the benefit of positive AUM flows. 

The provision for credit losses increased $115 million to $136 million primarily due to the weaker economic outlook related to COVID-19. Noninterest expense remained relatively unchanged at $3.5 billion . 

The return on average allocated capital was 17 percent, down from 30 percent, due to lower net income and, to a lesser extent, a small increase in allocated capital. 

MLGWM revenue of $3.6 billion decreased ten percent primarily driven by the impact of lower interest rates, transactional 

&#160;

revenue and market valuations, as well as declines in AUM pricing, partially offset by the benefit of positive AUM flows. 

Bank of America Private Bank revenue of $800 million decreased six percent primarily driven by the impact of lower interest rates and lower market valuations. 

Six-Month Comparison 

Net income for GWIM decreased $629 million to $1.5 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 due to lower revenue, higher provision for credit losses and higher noninterest expense. The operating margin was 21 percent compared to 29 percent a year ago. 

Net interest income decreased $359 million to $2.9 billion due to the same factors as described in the three-month discussion. 

Noninterest income, which primarily includes investment and brokerage services income, remained relatively unchanged at $6.4 billion as the benefits of higher market valuations and positive AUM flows were offset by declines in AUM pricing and lower transactional revenue compared to the same period in 2019 . 

The provision for credit losses increased $299 million to $325 million primarily due to the weaker economic outlook related to COVID-19. Noninterest expense increased $176 million to $7.1 billion , primarily due to investments for business growth along with higher revenue-related incentives. 

The return on average allocated capital was 20 percent, down from 30 percent, due to lower net income and, to a lesser extent, a small increase in allocated capital. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Bank of America &#160; 16 

MLGWM revenue of $7.7 billion decreased four percent primarily driven by the impact of lower interest rates and AUM pricing, partially offset by higher market valuations, positive AUM flows and increased transactional revenue. 

&#160;

Bank of America Private Bank revenue of $1.7 billion decreased three percent primarily driven by the impact of lower interest rates.

Global Banking , which includes Global Corporate Banking, Global Commercial Banking, Business Banking and Global Investment Banking, provides a wide range of lending-related products and services, integrated working capital management and treasury solutions, and underwriting and advisory services through our network of offices and client relationship teams . For more information about Global Banking, s ee Business Segment Operations in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 

Three-Month Comparison 

Net income for Global Banking decreased $1.2 billion to $726 million primarily driven by higher provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher revenue. 

Revenue increased $116 million to $5.1 billion driven by higher noninterest income, partially offset by lower net interest income. Net interest income decreased $346 million to $2.4 billion primarily due to the allocation of ALM results and spread compression, partially offset by loan and deposit growth. 

Noninterest income increased $462 million to $2.7 billion primarily due to higher investment banking fees and valuation adjustments on leveraged loans and the fair value option loan portfolio. 

The provision for credit losses increased $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion primarily due to the weaker economic outlook related to 

&#160;

COVID-19. Noninterest expense remained relatively unchanged at $2.2 billion . 

The return on average allocated capital was seven percent in 2020 compared to 19 percent in 2019 , due to lower net income and, to a lesser extent, an increase in allocated capital. For information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 12 . 

Six-Month Comparison 

Net income for Global Banking decreased $3.1 billion to $862 million primarily driven by higher provision for credit losses as well as lower revenue. 

Revenue decreased $439 million to $9.7 billion driven by lower net interest income, partially offset by higher noninterest income. Net interest income decreased $524 million to $5.0 billion primarily driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion. 

Noninterest income increased $85 million to $4.7 billion primarily due to higher investment banking fees, partially offset by valuation adjustments on the fair value option loan portfolio, debt securities and leveraged loans and the allocation of ALM results. 

The provision for credit losses increased $3.7 billion to $4.0 billion primarily due to the weaker economic outlook related to COVID-19. Noninterest expense increased $66 million primarily due to continued investments in the business, partially offset by lower revenue-related incentives. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Bank of America &#160; 18 

The return on average allocated capital was four percent in 2020 compared to 19 percent in 2019 , due to lower net income and, to a lesser extent, an increase in allocated capital. For information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 12 .

Business Lending revenue decreased $196 million and $355 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by the allocation of ALM results, partially offset by the impact of higher loan and lease balances. 

Global Transaction Services revenue decreased $350 million and $509 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 driven by the allocation of ALM results, partially offset by the impact of higher deposit balances. 

Average loans and leases increased 12 percent and 8 percent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 driven by growth in the commercial and industrial loan portfolio. Average deposits increased 36 percent and 23 percent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 primarily due to client responses to market volatility, government stimulus and placement of credit draws.

The following explanations for current period-over-period changes in results for Global Markets , including those disclosed under Sales and Trading Revenue, exclude net DVA, but the explanations would be the same if net DVA were included. Revenue amounts excluding net DVA are a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information on net DVA, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 8 . 

Three-Month Comparison 

Net income for Global Markets increased $849 million to $1.9 billion . Net DVA losses were $261 million compared to losses of $31 million . Excluding net DVA, net income increased $1.0 billion to $2.1 billion . These increases were primarily driven by higher revenue, partially offset by higher provision for credit losses. 

Revenue increased $1.2 billion to $5.3 billion as sales and trading revenue increased $909 million , and excluding net DVA, increased $1.1 billion . These increases were driven by higher revenue across Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC) and Equities. The prior-year period included a $199 million gain on the sale of an equity investment. 

The provision for credit losses increased $100 million primarily due to the weaker economic outlook related to COVID-19. Noninterest expense remained relatively unchanged at $2.7 billion . 

Average total assets decreased $22.3 billion to $663.1 billion driven by lower average client balances and increased balance sheet efficiency in Global Equities. 

The return on average allocated capital was 21 percent , up from 12 percent , reflecting higher net income, partially offset by a small increase in allocated capital. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 12 . 

&#160;

Six-Month Comparison 

Net income for Global Markets increased $1.5 billion to $3.6 

billion. Net DVA gains were $39 million compared to losses of $121 million . Excluding net DVA, net income increased $1.4 billion to $3.6 billion . These increases were primarily driven by an increase in revenue, partially offset by higher provision for credit losses and noninterest expense. 

Revenue increased $2.2 billion to $10.6 billion as sales and trading revenue increased $2.1 billion , and excluding net DVA, increased $1.9 billion . These increases were driven by higher revenue across FICC and Equities. 

The provision for credit losses increased $230 million primarily due to the weaker economic outlook related to COVID-19. Noninterest expense increased $62 million to $5.5 billion primarily driven by higher revenue-related expenses. 

Average total assets increased $13.3 billion to $688.1 billion primarily due to increased levels of inventory in FICC to facilitate expected client demand. Period-end total assets increased $10.3 billion since December 31, 2019 to $652.1 billion primarily driven by Equities resulting from a change in composition of equity hedges for client activity versus year end. 

The return on average allocated capital was 20 percent , up from 12 percent , reflecting higher net income, partially offset by a small increase in allocated capital.

FICC and Equities sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, is a non-GAAP financial measure. FICC net DVA losses were $245 million and gains of $29 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to losses of $30 million and $109 million for the same periods in 2019 . Equities net DVA losses were $16 million and gains of $10 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to losses of $1 million and $12 million for the same periods in 2019 . 

Three-Month Comparison 

FICC revenue increased $1.1 billion driven by strong results across credit-related products, especially in the Americas, as prices recovered from the first quarter of 2020 , combined with solid market-making conditions across macro products. Equities revenue increased $81 million driven by a strong performance in cash and client financing, partially offset by a weaker performance in derivatives. 

&#160;

Six-Month Comparison 

FICC revenue increased $1.4 billion driven by increased client activity and improved market making-conditions across macro products, partially offset by weaker performances in credit-sensitive businesses. Equities revenue increased $552 million driven by increased client activity and a strong trading performance in a more volatile market environment.

In segments where the total of liabilities and equity exceeds assets, which are generally deposit-taking segments, we allocate assets from All Other to those segments to match liabilities (i.e., deposits) and allocated shareholders&#8217; equity. Average allocated assets were $740.7 billion and $656.5 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to $549.5 billion and $543.0 billion for the same periods in 2019, and period-end allocated assets were $829.1 billion and $565.4 billion at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . 

n/m = not meaningful 

All Other consists of ALM activities, equity investments, non-core mortgage loans and servicing activities, liquidating businesses and certain expenses not otherwise allocated to a business segment. ALM activities encompass certain residential mortgages, debt securities, and interest rate and foreign currency risk management activities. Substantially all of the results of ALM activities are allocated to our business segments . For more information on our ALM activities, see Note 17 &#8211; Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Equity investments include our merchant services joint venture, as well as a portfolio of equity, real estate and other alternative investments . For information on our merchant services joint venture, see Executive Summary &#8211; Recent Developments &#8211; Merchant Services Joint Venture on page 5 and Note 10 &#8211; Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements . For more information about All Other, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 

Residential mortgage loans that are held for ALM purposes, including interest rate or liquidity risk management, are classified as core and are presented on the balance sheet of All Other . During the six months ended June 30, 2020 , residential mortgage loans held for ALM activities decreased $10.6 billion to $11.1 billion due primarily to loan sales. Non-core residential mortgage and home equity loans, which are principally runoff portfolios, are also held in All Other . During the six months ended June 30, 2020 , total non-core loans decreased $1.6 billion to $14.1 billion due primarily to payoffs and paydowns, as well as Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan conveyances and sales, partially offset by repurchases. For more information on the composition of the core and non-core portfolios, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 31 . 

Three-Month Comparison 

Net income for All Other increased $207 million primarily driven 

&#160;

by higher revenue and lower noninterest expense, partially offset by a decrease in the benefit in the provision for credit losses. 

Revenue increased $241 million primarily due to a $704 million gain on sales of certain mortgage loans, partially offset by lower net interest income and equity investment income. 

Noninterest expense decreased $207 million to $309 million reflecting a decrease in compensation and benefits, lower non-core mortgage costs, primarily due to lower volume, and lower technology costs. 

The benefit in the provision for credit losses decreased $220 million to $21 million from the prior period, which included higher recoveries from the sales of previously charged-off consumer real estate loans. 

The income tax benefit decreased $21 million reflecting the impact of lower pretax losses. Both periods included income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking . 

Six-Month Comparison 

The net loss for All Other increased $251 million , driven by higher provision for credit losses and lower revenue, partially offset by lower noninterest expense. 

Revenue decreased $107 million primarily due to certain valuation adjustments on securities and derivatives and extinguishment losses on certain structured liabilities, partially offset by a gain on sales of mortgage loans. 

The provision for credit losses increased $388 million to $93 million due to the same factor as described in the three-month discussion. 

Noninterest expense decreased $360 million to $556 million due to the same factors as described in the three-month discussion. 

The income tax benefit decreased $116 million reflecting lower discrete tax benefits. Both periods included income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking .

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations 

We have contractual obligations to make future payments on debt and lease agreements. Additionally, in the normal course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements whereby we commit to future purchases of products or services from unaffiliated parties. For more information on obligations and commitments, see Note 10 &#8211; Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein, as well as Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K , and Note 12 &#8211; Long-term Debt and Note 13 &#8211; Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 

Representations and Warranties Obligations 

For more information on representations and warranties obligations in connection with the sale of mortgage loans, see Note 13 &#8211; Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 

Managing Risk 

Risk is inherent in all our business activities. The seven key types of risk faced by the Corporation are strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational. Sound risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver for our shareholders. If not managed well, risks can result in financial loss, regulatory sanctions and penalties, and damage to our reputation, each of which may adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategies. We take a comprehensive approach to risk management with a defined Risk Framework and an articulated Risk Appetite Statement which are approved annually by the Enterprise Risk Committee and the Board. 

Our Risk Framework serves as the foundation for the consistent and effective management of risks facing the Corporation. The Risk Framework sets forth clear roles, responsibilities and accountability for the management of risk and provides a blueprint for how the Board, through delegation of authority to committees and executive officers, establishes risk appetite and associated limits for our activities. 

Our Risk Appetite Statement is intended to ensure that the Corporation maintains an acceptable risk profile by providing a common framework and a comparable set of measures for senior management and the Board to clearly indicate the level of risk the Corporation is willing to accept. Risk appetite is set at least annually and is aligned with the Corporation&#8217;s strategic, capital and financial operating plans. Our line of business strategies and risk appetite are also similarly aligned. 

For more information about the Corporation's risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic, see Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors on page 104 . These COVID-19 related risks are being managed within our Risk Framework and supporting risk management programs. 

For more information on our Risk Framework, our risk management activities and the key types of risk faced by the Corporation, see the Managing Risk through Reputational Risk sections in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 

Capital Management 

The Corporation manages its capital position so that its capital is more than adequate to support its business activities and aligns with risk, risk appetite and strategic planning. For more information on capital management, including related regulatory requirements, 

&#160;

see Capital Management in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 

CCAR and Capital Planning 

The Federal Reserve requires BHCs to submit a capital plan and planned capital actions on an annual basis, consistent with the rules governing the CCAR capital plan. In June 2020, the Federal Reserve notified BHCs of their 2020 CCAR supervisory stress test results. Based on our results, we will be subject to a preliminary 2.5 percent SCB for the period beginning October 1, 2020 and ending on September 30, 2021. Our Common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio under the Standardized approach must remain above 9.5 percent during this period (the sum of our CET1 capital ratio minimum of 4.5 percent, global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge of 2.5 percent and our preliminary SCB of 2.5 percent) in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. The Federal Reserve plans to finalize the SCB for all BHCs by August 31, 2020. 

The Federal Reserve also announced that due to economic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, all large banks will be required to suspend share repurchase programs in the third quarter of 2020, except for repurchases to offset shares issued under equity compensation plans, and limit dividends to existing rates that do not exceed the average of the last four quarters&#8217; net income. Large banks will also be required to resubmit and update their capital plans later this year based on instructions that the Federal Reserve will provide. The Federal Reserve plans to conduct additional analysis to assess the Corporation&#8217;s capital plans and will review capital preservation measures on a quarter-by-quarter basis. 

The Federal Reserve&#8217;s directive regarding share repurchases aligns with our decision to voluntarily suspend repurchases in the first quarter of 2020 from the date of the announcement on March 15, 2020 through the end of the second quarter of 2020. The suspension of our repurchases did not include repurchases to offset shares issued under our equity compensation plans, for which we repurchased $286 million of common stock during the second quarter of 2020 pursuant to the Board&#8217;s repurchase authorization under our 2019 CCAR capital plan. For more information, see Capital Management -- CCAR and Capital Planning in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 

We intend to maintain the quarterly common stock dividend at the current rate of $0.18 per share until further notice, subject to approval by the Board. We will also continue our current suspension of common stock repurchases in the third quarter of 2020, except for repurchases to offset shares issued under equity compensation plans. 

Our repurchase program is subject to the Board&#8217;s approval, and at such time that we reinstate our stock repurchase program, our stock repurchases will be subject to various factors, including the Corporation&#8217;s capital position, liquidity, financial performance and alternative uses of capital, stock trading price and general market conditions, and may be suspended at any time. Such repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including repurchase plans that satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). For more information, see Regulatory Developments in this section. 

Regulatory Capital 

As a financial services holding company, we are subject to regulatory capital rules, including Basel 3, issued by U.S. banking regulators. The Corporation's depository institution subsidiaries are also subject to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework. 

23 &#160; Bank of America 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The Corporation and its primary affiliated banking entity, BANA, are Advanced approaches institutions under Basel 3 and are required to report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and risk-weighted assets under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is used to assess capital adequacy including under the PCA framework. As of June 30, 2020 , the CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total Capital ratios for the Corporation were lower under the Advanced approaches. 

Minimum Capital Requirements 

In order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments, the Corporation must meet risk-based capital ratio requirements that include a capital conservation buffer greater than 2.5 percent, plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer and a G-SIB surcharge. Beginning October 1, 2020, the capital conservation buffer will be replaced by the SCB for the Corporation&#8217;s Standardized approach ratio 

&#160;

requirements. The buffers and surcharge must be comprised solely of CET1 capital. 

The Corporation is also required to maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Our insured depository institution subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be considered well capitalized under the PCA framework. 

Capital Composition and Ratios 

Table 9 presents Bank of America Corporation&#8217;s capital ratios and related information in accordance with Basel 3 Standardized and Advanced approaches as measured at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . For the periods presented herein, the Corporation met the definition of well capitalized under current regulatory requirements.

The capital conservation buffer and G-SIB surcharge were 2.5 percent at both June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . The countercyclical capital buffer for both periods was zero . The SLR minimum includes a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent.

Supplementary leverage exposure at June 30, 2020 reflects the temporary exclusion of U.S. Treasury Securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks. 

At June 30, 2020 , CET1 capital was $171.0 billion , an increase of $4.3 billion from December 31, 2019 , driven by earnings and net unrealized gains on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities included in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI), partially offset by common stock repurchases and dividends. Total capital under the Advanced approaches increased $10.1 billion primarily driven by the same factors as CET1 capital, increases in excess eligible credit reserves included in Tier 2 capital and the 

&#160;

issuance of preferred stock. Risk-weighted assets under the Advanced approaches, which yielded the lower CET1 capital ratio at June 30, 2020 , increased $ 57.0 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2020 to $1,504 billion primarily due to changes in corporate risk ratings, increased counterparty credit risk and market risk RWA.

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity Requirements 

Total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) consists of the Corporation&#8217;s Tier 1 capital and eligible long-term debt issued directly by the Corporation. Eligible long-term debt for TLAC ratios is comprised of unsecured debt that has a remaining maturity of at least one year and satisfies additional requirements as prescribed in the TLAC final rule. As with the risk-based capital ratios and SLR, the 

&#160;

Corporation is required to maintain TLAC ratios in excess of minimum requirements plus applicable buffers to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Table 13 presents the Corporation's TLAC and long-term debt ratios and related information as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 .

Regulatory Developments 

The following supplements the disclosure in Capital Management &#8211; Regulatory Developments in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 

Revisions to Basel 3 to Address Current Expected Credit Loss Accounting 

On January 1, 2020, the Corporation adopted the new accounting standard that requires the measurement of the allowance for credit losses to be based on management&#8217;s best estimate of lifetime ECL inherent in the Corporation's relevant financial assets. For more information, see Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements . During the first quarter of 2020, in accordance with an interim final rule issued by U.S. banking regulators, the Corporation delayed for two years the initial adoption impact of CECL on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of the capital benefit provided during 2020 and 2021 (i.e., a five-year transition period). For more information, see Capital Management &#8211; Regulatory Developments in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 . 

Stress Capital Buffer 

On March 4, 2020, the Federal Reserve issued a final rule that integrates the annual quantitative assessment of the CCAR program with the buffer requirements in the U.S. Basel 3 Final Rule. The new approach replaces the existing static 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer for Basel 3 Standardized approach requirements with a stress capital buffer, calculated as the decline in the CET1 capital ratio under the supervisory severely adverse scenario plus four quarters of planned common stock dividends, floored at 2.5 percent. Based on the CCAR 2020 supervisory stress test results, the Corporation will be subject to a preliminary 2.5 percent SCB for the period beginning October 1, 2020 and ending on September 30, 2021. The Federal Reserve plans to finalize the SCB for all BHCs by August 31, 2020. 

In conjunction with this new requirement, the Federal Reserve has removed the annual CCAR quantitative objection process beginning with CCAR 2020. While the final rule continues to require that the Corporation describe its planned capital distributions in its CCAR capital plan, the Corporation is no longer required to seek prior approval if it makes capital distributions in excess of those included in its CCAR capital plan. The Corporation is instead subject to automatic distribution limitations if its capital ratios fall below its buffer requirements, which include the stress capital buffer. 

Supplementary Leverage Ratio 

On April 1, 2020, in response to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve issued an interim final rule to temporarily exclude the on-balance sheet amounts of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from the calculation of supplementary leverage exposure for bank holding companies. The rule is effective for June 30, 2020 through March 31, 2021 reports. As of June 30, 2020, temporary exclusions improved the supplementary leverage ratio by 0.9 percent to 7.1 percent. 

On May 15, 2020, the U.S. banking regulators issued an interim final rule that provides a similar temporary exclusion to depository institutions, effective from the beginning of the second quarter of 2020 through March 31, 2021; however, institutions must elect the relief. Beginning in the third quarter of 2020, a depository institution electing to apply the exclusion must receive approval from its primary regulator prior to making any capital distributions 

&#160;

as long as the exclusion is in effect. As of June 30, 2020, the Corporation&#8217;s insured depository institution subsidiaries have not elected the exclusions. 

Paycheck Protection Program Loans 

On April 9, 2020, in response to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation issued an interim final rule that, among other things, stipulates PPP loans, which are guaranteed by the Small Business Administration, will receive a zero percent risk weight under the Basel 3 Advanced and Standardized approaches. For more information on the PPP, see Executive Summary - Recent Developments &#8211; COVID-19 Pandemic on page 3 and Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements . 

Standardized Approach for Measuring Counterparty Credit Risk 

As of June 30, 2020 the Corporation adopted the new standardized approach for measuring counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR), which replaces the current exposure method for calculating the exposure amount of derivative contracts for risk-weighted assets and supplementary leverage exposure. Adoption of SA-CCR resulted in a decrease of approximately $15 billion in the Corporation&#8217;s Standardized risk-weighted assets, and a $66 billion decrease in supplementary leverage exposure. 

Swap Dealer Capital Requirements 

On July 22, 2020, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) issued a final rule to establish capital requirements for swap dealers and major swap participants that are not subject to existing U.S. prudential regulation. Under the rule, applicable subsidiaries of the Corporation would be permitted to elect one of two approaches to compute their regulatory capital. The first approach is a bank-based capital approach which requires that firms maintain CET1 capital greater than or equal to 6.5 percent of the entity&#8217;s RWA as calculated under Basel 3, Total capital greater than or equal to 8.0 percent of the entity&#8217;s RWA as calculated under Basel 3 and Total capital greater than or equal to 8.0 percent of the entity&#8217;s uncleared swap margin. The second approach is based on net liquid assets and requires that a firm maintain net capital greater than or equal to 2.0 percent of uncleared swap margin. The final rule also includes reporting requirements. The impact to the Corporation is not expected to be significant. 

Regulatory Capital and Securities Regulation 

The Corporation&#8217;s principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are BofA Securities, Inc. (BofAS), Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp. (MLPCC) and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &#38; Smith Incorporated (MLPF&#38;S). The Corporation's principal European broker-dealer subsidiaries are Merrill Lynch International (MLI) and BofA Securities Europe SA (BofASE). 

The U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the net capital requirements of Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act. BofAS computes its minimum capital requirements as an alternative net capital broker-dealer under Rule 15c3-1, and MLPCC and MLPF&#38;S compute their minimum capital requirements in accordance with the alternative standard under Rule 15c3-1. BofAS and MLPCC are also registered as futures commission merchants and are subject to CFTC Regulation 1.17. The U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are also registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA). Pursuant to FINRA Rule 4110, FINRA may impose higher net capital requirements than 

27 &#160; Bank of America 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act with respect to each of the broker-dealers. 

BofAS provides institutional services, and in accordance with the alternative net capital requirements, is required to maintain tentative net capital in excess of $1.0 billion and net capital in excess of the greater of $500 million or a certain percentage of its reserve requirement. BofAS must also notify the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the event its tentative net capital is less than $5.0 billion. BofAS is also required to hold a certain percentage of its risk-based margin in order to meet its CFTC minimum net capital requirement. At June 30, 2020 , BofAS had tentative net capital of $19.4 billion. BofAS also had regulatory net capital of $16.6 billion which exceeded the minimum requirement of $3.0 billion. 

MLPCC is a fully-guaranteed subsidiary of BofAS and provides clearing and settlement services as well as prime brokerage and arranged financing services for institutional clients. At June 30, 2020 , MLPCC&#8217;s regulatory net capital of $7.4 billion exceeded the minimum requirement of $1.2 billion. 

MLPF&#38;S provides retail services. At June 30, 2020 , MLPF&#38;S' regulatory net capital was $4.4 billion which exceeded the minimum requirement of $134 million. 

Our European broker-dealers are regulated by non-U.S. regulators. MLI, a U.K. investment firm, is regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority and is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. At June 30, 2020 , MLI&#8217;s capital resources were $35.0 billion, which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $13.8 billion. BofASE, a French investment firm, is regulated by the Autorit&#233; de Contr&#244;le Prudentiel et de R&#233;solution and the Autorit&#233; des March&#233;s Financiers, and is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. At June 30, 2020 , BofASE's capital resources were $5.5 billion which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $1.7 billion. 

Liquidity Risk 

Funding and Liquidity Risk Management 

Our primary liquidity risk management objective is to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral needs while continuing to support our businesses and customers under a range of economic conditions. To achieve that objective, we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk under expected and stressed conditions, maintain liquidity and access to diverse funding sources, including our stable deposit base, and seek to align liquidity-related incentives and risks. These liquidity risk management practices have allowed us to effectively manage the market stress that began in the first quarter of 2020 from the COVID-19 pandemic. For more information on the effects of the pandemic, see Executive Summary - Recent Developments &#8211; COVID-19 Pandemic on page 3 . 

We define liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we can use to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations as those obligations arise. We manage our liquidity position through line of business and ALM activities, as well as through our legal entity funding strategy, on both a forward and current (including intraday) basis under both expected and stressed conditions. We believe that a centralized approach to funding and liquidity management enhances our ability to monitor liquidity requirements, maximizes access to funding sources, minimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely responses to liquidity events. For more information regarding global funding and liquidity risk management, as well as liquidity sources, liquidity arrangements, contingency planning and credit ratings discussed 

&#160;

below, see Liquidity Risk in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 

NB Holdings Corporation 

We have intercompany arrangements with certain key subsidiaries under which we transferred certain assets of Bank of America Corporation, as the parent company, which is a separate and distinct legal entity from our banking and nonbank subsidiaries, and agreed to transfer certain additional parent company assets not needed to satisfy anticipated near term expenditures, to NB Holdings Corporation, a wholly-owned holding company subsidiary (NB Holdings). The parent company is expected to continue to have access to the same flow of dividends, interest and other amounts of cash necessary to service its debt, pay dividends and perform other obligations as it would have had if it had not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets. These arrangements support our preferred single point of entry resolution strategy, under which only the parent company would be resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

(1) Nonbank includes Parent, NB Holdings and other regulated entities. 

We maintain liquidity available to the Corporation, including the parent company and selected subsidiaries, in the form of cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. Typically, parent company and NB Holdings liquidity is in the form of cash deposited with BANA. 

Our bank subsidiaries&#8217; liquidity is primarily driven by deposit and lending activity, as well as securities valuation and net debt activity. Liquidity at bank subsidiaries excludes the cash deposited by the parent company and NB Holdings. Our bank subsidiaries can also generate incremental liquidity by pledging a range of unencumbered loans and securities to certain Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The cash we could have obtained by borrowing against this pool of specifically-identified eligible assets was $340 billion and $372 billion at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . We have established operational procedures to enable us to borrow against these assets, including regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible loans and securities collateral. Eligibility is defined in guidelines from the FHLBs and the Federal Reserve and is subject to change at their discretion. Due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries can generally be used only to fund obligations within the bank subsidiaries, and transfers to the parent company or nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to prior regulatory approval. 

Liquidity held in other regulated entities, comprised primarily of broker-dealer subsidiaries, is primarily available to meet the obligations of that entity and transfers to the parent company or to any other subsidiary may be subject to prior regulatory approval due to regulatory restrictions and minimum requirements. Our other regulated entities also hold unencumbered investment-grade

securities and equities that we believe could be used to generate additional liquidity.

Our GLS are substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the final U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) rules. However, HQLA for purposes of calculating LCR is not reported at market value, but at a lower value that incorporates regulatory deductions and the exclusion of excess liquidity held at certain subsidiaries. The LCR is calculated as the amount of a financial institution&#8217;s unencumbered HQLA relative to the estimated net cash outflows the institution could encounter over a 30-day period of significant liquidity stress, expressed as a percentage. Our average consolidated HQLA, on a net basis, was $549 billion and $464 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . For the same periods, the average consolidated LCR was 121 percent and 116 percent . Our LCR fluctuates due to normal business flows from customer activity. 

&#160;

Liquidity Stress Analysis 

We utilize liquidity stress analysis to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our subsidiaries to meet contractual and contingent cash outflows under a range of scenarios. For more information on our liquidity stress analysis, see Liquidity Risk &#8211; Liquidity Stress Analysis in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 

Diversified Funding Sources 

We fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits, and secured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally coordinated funding approach diversified across products, programs, markets, currencies and investor groups. We fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposits, which were $1.72 trillion and $1.43 trillion at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . 

Our trading activities in other regulated entities are primarily funded on a secured basis through securities lending and repurchase agreements, and these amounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions. 

Long-term Debt 

During the six months ended June 30, 2020 , we issued $30.7 billion of long-term debt consisting of $26.2 billion of notes issued by Bank of America Corporation, substantially all of which was TLAC compliant, $817 million of notes issued by Bank of America, N.A. and $3.7 billion of other debt, substantially all of which were structured liabilities. 

During the six months ended June 30, 2020 , we had total long-term debt maturities and redemptions in the aggregate of $20.4 billion consisting of $6.4 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $8.6 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $5.4 billion of other debt. Table 16 presents the carrying value of aggregate annual contractual maturities of long-term debt at June 30, 2020 .

Total long-term debt increased $20.8 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2020 primarily due to debt issuances and valuation adjustments, partially offset by maturities and redemptions. We may, from time to time, purchase outstanding debt instruments in various transactions, depending on market conditions, liquidity and other factors. Our other regulated entities may also make markets in our debt instruments to provide liquidity for investors. 

We use derivative transactions to manage the duration, interest rate and currency risks of our borrowings, considering the characteristics of the assets they are funding. For more information on our ALM activities, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 47 . 

We may issue unsecured debt in the form of structured notes for client purposes, certain of which qualify as TLAC-eligible debt. During the six months ended June 30, 2020 , we issued $5.3 billion of structured notes, which are debt obligations that pay investors returns linked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. We typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these liabilities with derivatives and/or investments in the underlying instruments, so that from a funding perspective, the cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. We could be required to settle certain structured note obligations for cash or other securities prior to maturity under certain circumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning purposes. We believe, however, that a portion of such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or redemption date. 

Substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings, 

&#160;

financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price. For more information on long-term debt funding, including issuances and maturities and redemptions, see Note 12 &#8211; Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 

Credit Ratings 

Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by rating agencies on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and other securities, including asset securitizations. Table 18 presents the Corporation&#8217;s current long-term/short-term senior debt ratings and outlooks expressed by the rating agencies. 

On April 22, 2020, Fitch Ratings (Fitch) completed its review of the large, complex securities trading and universal banks in the U.S., including Bank of America, in response to declining economic activity from the COVID-19 pandemic. The agency affirmed the long-term and short-term senior debt ratings of the Corporation and all of its rated subsidiaries, except for select issuer and instrument level ratings that had previously been placed under criteria observation (UCO) on March 4, 2020, following changes in the agency&#8217;s bank rating criteria on February 28, 2020. 

Concurrently, Fitch reached a conclusion on select UCO designations for the Corporation and upgraded the long-term and short-term senior debt ratings of MLI and BofASE by one notch to AA-/F1+. The agency also upgraded the preferred stock rating of the Corporation by one notch to BBB and downgraded the subordinated debt rating of the Corporation by one notch to A-. According to Fitch, rating changes UCO are the sole result of bank rating criteria change and do not reflect a change in the underlying fundamentals of the institution. Fitch&#8217;s rating outlook for all our long-term ratings is currently Stable. 

On June 9, 2020, Fitch affirmed as A the subordinated debt rating of BANA. This rating had remained UCO following Fitch&#8217;s broader rating actions. 

The ratings and outlooks from Moody&#8217;s Investors Service (Moody&#8217;s) and Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s Global Ratings for the Corporation and its subsidiaries did not change from those disclosed in the Corporation's 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

For more information on additional collateral and termination payments that could be required in connection with certain over-the-counter derivative contracts and other trading agreements in the event of a credit rating downgrade, see Note 3 &#8211; Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein and Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K .

Credit Risk Management 

For information on our credit risk management activities, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management below, Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 37 , Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 43 , Allowance for Credit Losses on page 44 , and Note 5 &#8211; Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements . 

During the six months ended June 30, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted economic activity in the U.S. and around the world. While we experienced increases in Commercial nonperforming loans and reservable criticized exposures as a result of weaker economic conditions arising from COVID-19, we did not see meaningful impacts to Consumer portfolio delinquencies, nonperforming loans or charge-offs during the six months ended June 30, 2020 due to payment deferrals and government stimulus benefits. To provide relief to individuals and businesses in the U.S., in March and April 2020, the President signed into law four economic stimulus packages, including the CARES Act. U.S. bank regulatory agencies also issued interagency guidance to financial institutions that are working with borrowers affected by COVID-19. 

To support our customers, we have implemented various loan modification programs and other forms of support, including offering loan payment deferrals, refunding certain fees and pausing foreclosure sales, evictions and repossessions. For a summary of the loan modification programs that we have implemented along with a summary of deferral requests that have been executed, see Executive Summary - Recent Developments &#8211; COVID-19 Pandemic on page 3 . 

For information on the accounting for loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic, see Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements . 

Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management 

Credit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower&#8217;s credit cycle. Statistical techniques in conjunction with experiential judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio management including underwriting, product pricing, risk appetite, setting credit limits, and establishing operating processes and metrics to 

&#160;

quantify and balance risks and returns. Statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external sources such as credit bureaus and/or internal historical experience and are a component of our consumer credit risk management process. These models are used in part to assist in making both new and ongoing credit decisions, as well as portfolio management strategies, including authorizations and line management, collection practices and strategies, and determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses and allocated capital for credit risk. 

Consumer Credit Portfolio 

Although COVID-19 is severely impacting economic activity, it did not have a meaningful impact on the consumer portfolio delinquencies, nonperforming loans or charge-offs as of and during the six months ended June 30, 2020 due to payment deferrals and government stimulus benefits but there may be adverse impacts to credit quality metrics in future periods if negative economic conditions continue. Net charge-offs increased $43 million and $80 million to $734 million and $1.6 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 driven by lower consumer real estate loan sale recoveries. 

The consumer allowance for loan and lease losses increased $6.4 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2020 to $11.0 billion due to the adoption of the new CECL accounting standard and deterioration in the economic outlook resulting from the impact of COVID-19.

Residential mortgage loans accruing past due 90 days or more are fully-insured loans. At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , residential mortgage includes $590 million and $740 million of loans on which interest had been curtailed by the FHA, and therefore were no longer accruing interest, although principal was still insured, and $264 million and $348 million of loans on which interest was still accruing. 

(2) &#160; 

Outstandings primarily include auto and specialty lending loans and leases of $48.4 billion and $50.4 billion , U.S. securities-based lending loans of $36.6 billion and $36.7 billion and non-U.S. consumer loans of $2.8 billion and $2.8 billion at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . 

(3) &#160; 

Consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option include residential mortgage loans of $330 million and $257 million and home equity loans of $354 million and $337 million at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . For more information on the fair value option, see Note 15 &#8211; Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements . 

(4) &#160; 

Excludes consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option. At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , $7 million and $6 million of loans accounted for under the fair value option were past due 90 days or more and not accruing interest.

Table 21 presents outstandings, nonperforming balances, net charge-offs, allowance for credit losses and provision for credit losses for the core and non-core portfolios within the consumer real estate portfolio. We categorize consumer real estate loans as core and non-core based on loan and customer characteristics such as origination date, product type, loan-to-value (LTV), Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score and delinquency status consistent with our current consumer and mortgage servicing strategy. Generally, loans that were originated after January 1, 2010, qualified under government-sponsored enterprise 

&#160;

underwriting guidelines, or otherwise met our underwriting guidelines in place in 2015 are characterized as core loans. All other loans are generally characterized as non-core loans and represent runoff portfolios. Core loans as reported in Table 21 include loans held in the Consumer Banking and GWIM segments, as well as loans held for ALM activities in All Other . 

As shown in Table 21 , outstanding core consumer real estate loans increased $3.1 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2020 driven by an increase of $4.4 billion in residential mortgage, partially offset by a $1.3 billion decrease in home equity.

Outstandings and nonperforming loans exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. Consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option include residential mortgage loans of $330 million and $257 million and home equity loans of $354 million and $337 million at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . For more information, see Note 15 &#8211; Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements . 

(2) &#160; 

The home equity non-core allowance is in a negative position at June 30, 2020 as it includes expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off. 

(3) &#160; 

Home equity allowance includes a reserve for unfunded lending commitments of $141 million at June 30, 2020 .

We believe that the presentation of information adjusted to exclude the impact of the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option is more representative of the ongoing operations and credit quality of the business. As a result, in the following tables and discussions of the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios, we exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option and provide information that excludes the impact of the fully-insured loan portfolio in certain credit quality statistics. 

Residential Mortgage 

The residential mortgage portfolio made up the largest percentage of our consumer loan portfolio at 53 percent of consumer loans and leases at June 30, 2020 . Approximately 54 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio was in Consumer Banking and 37 percent was in GWIM. The remaining portion was in All Other and was comprised of loans used in our overall ALM activities, delinquent FHA loans repurchased pursuant to our servicing agreements with the Government National Mortgage Association 

&#160;

as well as loans repurchased related to our representations and warranties. 

Outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio increased $3.3 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2020 as retention of new originations was partially offset by both loan sales and runoff. 

At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , the residential mortgage portfolio included $11.7 billion and $18.7 billion of outstanding fully-insured loans, of which $3.1 billion and $11.2 billion had FHA insurance with the remainder protected by long-term standby agreements. The decline was primarily driven by sales of loans with FHA insurance during the three months ended June 30, 2020 . 

Table 22 presents certain residential mortgage key credit statistics on both a reported basis and excluding the fully-insured loan portfolio. The following discussion presents the residential mortgage portfolio excluding the fully-insured loan portfolio.

Includes loans that are contractually current which primarily consist of collateral-dependent TDRs, including those that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy and loans that have not yet demonstrated a sustained period of payment performance following a TDR. 

(3) &#160; 

These vintages of loans accounted for $435 million , or 28 percent , and $365 million , or 25 percent , of nonperforming residential mortgage loans at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . 

Nonperforming outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio increased $82 million during the six months ended June 30, 2020 primarily driven by the inclusion of certain loans that were previously classified as purchased credit-impaired loans and accounted for under a pool basis. Upon adoption of the new credit loss standard, these loans are accounted for on an individual basis and, if applicable, included in nonperforming loans. Of the nonperforming residential mortgage loans at June 30, 2020 , $628 million , or 40 percent , were current on contractual payments. Loans accruing past due 30 days or more decreased $397 million driven by both government stimulus benefits and payment deferrals associated with the economic impact of COVID-19, as well as seasonal declines. 

Net charge-offs decreased $23 million and $8 million to a net recovery of $20 million and $21 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 . This decrease is due largely to loan sales that generated a recovery of $16 million during the three months ended June 30, 2020. 

Of the $227.8 billion in total residential mortgage loans outstanding at June 30, 2020 , as shown in Table 22 , 26 percent were originated as interest-only loans. The outstanding balance of interest-only residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period was $6.6 billion , or 11 percent , at June 30, 2020 . Residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period generally have experienced a higher rate of 

&#160;

early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status compared to the residential mortgage portfolio as a whole. At June 30, 2020 , $87 million , or one percent of outstanding interest-only residential mortgages that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more compared to $899 million , or less than one percent , for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, at June 30, 2020 , $295 million , or four percent , of outstanding interest-only residential mortgage loans that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming, of which $111 million were contractually current, compared to $1.6 billion , or one percent , for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. Loans that have yet to enter the amortization period in our interest-only residential mortgage portfolio are primarily well-collateralized loans to our wealth management clients and have an interest-only period of three to ten years. Approximately 96 percent of these loans that have yet to enter the amortization period will not be required to make a fully-amortizing payment until 2022 or later. 

Table 23 presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the residential mortgage portfolio. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) within California represented 16 percent of outstandings at both June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 14 percent and 13 percent of outstandings at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 .

Home Equity 

At June 30, 2020 , the home equity portfolio made up nine percent of the consumer portfolio and was comprised of home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), home equity loans and reverse mortgages. We no longer originate home equity loans or reverse mortgages. 

At June 30, 2020 , our HELOC portfolio had an outstanding balance of $35.9 billion , or 94 percent of the total home equity portfolio, compared to $37.5 billion , or 93 percent , at December 31, 2019 . HELOCs generally have an initial draw period of 10 years, and after the initial draw period ends, the loans generally convert to 15- or 20-year amortizing loans. 

At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , our home equity loan portfolio had an outstanding balance of $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion , or three percent , of the total home equity portfolio. At June 30, 2020 , our reverse mortgage portfolio had an outstanding balance of $1.4 billion , or three percent of the total home equity portfolio, compared to $1.5 billion , or four percent , at December 31, 2019 . 

&#160;

At June 30, 2020 , 80 percent of the home equity portfolio was in Consumer Banking , 12 percent was in All Other and the remainder of the portfolio was primarily in GWIM . Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased $1.8 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2020 primarily due to paydowns outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines. Of the total home equity portfolio at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , $14.7 billion , or 38 percent , and $15.0 billion , or 37 percent , were in first-lien positions. At June 30, 2020 , outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio that were in a second-lien or more junior-lien position and where we also held the first-lien loan totaled $6.6 billion , or 17 percent , of our total home equity portfolio. 

Unused HELOCs totaled $44.4 billion and $43.6 billion at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . The increase was primarily driven by new production, partially offset by accounts closed voluntarily. The HELOC utilization rate was 45 percent and 46 percent at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 .

(2) &#160; 

Accruing past due 30 days or more include $20 million and $30 million and nonperforming loans include $62 million and $57 million of loans where we serviced the underlying first lien at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . 

(3) &#160; 

Includes loans that are contractually current which primarily consist of collateral-dependent TDRs, including those that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, junior-lien loans where the underlying first lien is 90 days or more past due, as well as loans that have not yet demonstrated a sustained period of payment performance following a TDR. 

(4) &#160; 

These vintages of loans accounted for 35 percent and 34 percent of nonperforming home equity loans at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . 

Nonperforming outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio increased $58 million during the six months ended June 30, 2020 primarily driven by an increase in loans that were current on their contractual payments, as well as the inclusion of certain loans that were previously classified as purchased credit-impaired loans and accounted for under a pool basis. Upon adoption of the new credit loss standard, these loans are accounted for on an individual basis and, if applicable, included in nonperforming loans. Of the nonperforming home equity loans at June 30, 2020 , $266 million , or 45 percent , were current on contractual payments. In addition, $201 million , or 34 percent , of nonperforming home 

&#160;

equity loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell. Accruing loans that were 30 days or more past due decreased $44 million during the six months ended June 30, 2020 . 

Net charge-offs increased $141 million to a net recovery of $14 million , and $119 million to a net recovery of $25 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 as the prior-year period included recoveries from non-core home equity loan sales. 

Of the $38.4 billion in total home equity portfolio outstandings at June 30, 2020 , as shown in Table 24 , 15 percent require 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Bank of America &#160; 34 

interest-only payments. The outstanding balance of HELOCs that have reached the end of their draw period and have entered the 

amortization period was $10.6 billion at June 30, 2020 . The HELOCs that have entered the amortization period have experienced a higher percentage of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status when compared to the HELOC portfolio as a whole. At June 30, 2020 , $124 million , or one percent of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more. In addition, at June 30, 2020 , $438 million , or four percent , were nonperforming. Loans that have yet to enter the amortization period in our interest-only portfolio are primarily post-2008 vintages and generally have better credit quality than the previous vintages that had entered the amortization period. We communicate to contractually current customers more than a year prior to the end of their draw period to inform them of the potential change to the payment structure 

&#160;

before entering the amortization period, and provide payment options to customers prior to the end of the draw period. 

Although we do not actively track how many of our home equity customers pay only the minimum amount due on their home equity loans and lines, we can infer some of this information through a review of our HELOC portfolio that we service and that is still in its revolving period. During the three months ended June 30, 2020 , 18 percent of these customers with an outstanding balance did not pay any principal on their HELOCs. 

Table 25 presents outstandings, nonperforming balances and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the home equity portfolio. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 13 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana MSA within California made up 11 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 .

Credit Card 

At June 30, 2020 , 97 percent of the credit card portfolio was managed in Consumer Banking with the remainder in GWIM . Outstandings in the credit card portfolio decreased $13.4 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2020 to $84.2 billion due to lower retail spending. Net charge-offs decreased $97 million to $665 million and $72 million to $1.4 billion during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 due to government stimulus benefits and payment deferrals associated with COVID-19. Credit card loans 30 days or 

&#160;

more past due and still accruing interest decreased $615 million and loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest decreased $260 million primarily due to government stimulus benefits and payment deferrals along with declines in loan balances associated with COVID-19. 

Unused lines of credit for credit card increased to $348.1 billion at June 30, 2020 from $336.9 billion at December 31, 2019 driven by lower purchase volumes.

Direct/Indirect Consumer 

At June 30, 2020 , 55 percent of the direct/indirect portfolio was included in Consumer Banking (consumer auto and specialty lending &#8211; automotive, recreational vehicle, marine, aircraft and consumer personal loans) and 45 percent was included in GWIM (principally securities-based lending loans). Outstandings in the 

&#160;

direct/indirect portfolio decreased $2.4 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2020 to $88.6 billion primarily due to lower originations in Auto.

Nonperforming Consumer Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity 

Table 28 presents nonperforming consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 . During the six months ended June 30, 2020 , nonperforming consumer loans increased $138 million to $2.2 billion primarily driven by the inclusion of $135 million of certain loans that were previously classified as purchased credit-impaired loans and accounted for under a pool basis. 

At June 30, 2020 , $730 million , or 33 percent of nonperforming loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to their estimated property value less costs to sell. In addition, at June 30, 2020 , $934 million , or 43 percent of nonperforming consumer loans were modified and are now current after 

&#160;

successful trial periods, or are current loans classified as nonperforming loans in accordance with applicable policies. 

Foreclosed properties decreased $60 million during the six months ended June 30, 2020 to $169 million as liquidations outpaced additions. 

Nonperforming loans also include certain loans that have been modified in TDRs where economic concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. Nonperforming TDRs are included in Table 28 . For more information on our loan modification programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which are not TDRs, see Executive Summary - Recent Developments &#8211; COVID-19 Pandemic on page 3 and Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements .

At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , residential mortgage TDRs deemed collateral dependent totaled $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion , and included $698 million and $748 million of loans classified as nonperforming and $415 million and $468 million of loans classified as performing. 

(2) &#160; 

At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , residential mortgage performing TDRs include $1.6 billion and $2.1 billion of loans that were fully-insured. 

(3) &#160; 

At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , home equity TDRs deemed collateral dependent totaled $422 million and $442 million , and include $209 million and $209 million of loans classified as nonperforming and $213 million and $233 million of loans classified as performing. 

In addition to modifying consumer real estate loans, we work with customers who are experiencing financial difficulty by modifying credit card and other consumer loans. Credit card and other consumer loan modifications generally involve a reduction in the customer&#8217;s interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months, all of which are considered TDRs (the renegotiated TDR portfolio). 

Modifications of credit card and other consumer loans are made through renegotiation programs utilizing direct customer contact, but may also utilize external renegotiation programs. The renegotiated TDR portfolio is excluded in large part from Table 28 as substantially all of the loans remain on accrual status until either charged off or paid in full. At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , our renegotiated TDR portfolio was $677 million and $679 million , of which $601 million and $570 million were current or less than 30 days past due under the modified terms. 

Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management 

Commercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal that concentrations of credit exposure continue to be aligned with our risk appetite. We review, measure and manage concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, customer relationship and loan size. We also review, measure and manage commercial real estate loans by geographic location and property type. In addition, within our non-U.S. portfolio, we evaluate exposures by region and by country. Tables 34 , 37 and 40 summarize our concentrations. We also utilize syndications of exposure to third parties, loan sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of the commercial credit portfolio. For more information on our industry concentrations, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management &#8211; Industry Concentrations on page 41 and Table 37 . 

For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, net charge-offs and TDRs for the commercial portfolio, see Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K .

&#160;

Commercial Credit Portfolio 

During the six months ended June 30, 2020 , commercial asset quality weakened as a result of the economic impact from COVID-19. However, there were also positive signs during this period. Of the draws by large corporate and commercial clients contributing to the $67.2 billion loan growth in the first three months of 2020, $62.0 billion was repaid as emergency or contingent funding was no longer needed or clients were able to access capital markets. Additionally, as part of the CARES Act, we funded $25.1 billion of PPP loans for our small business clients, which are included in U.S. small business commercial in the tables 

in this section. For more information on PPP loans, see Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements . 

Credit quality of commercial real estate borrowers in most sectors remained stable but various sectors continued to experience varying degrees of strain as a result of COVID-19. Hospitality and retail sectors have been most negatively impacted. Many real estate markets experienced disruption in demand, supply chain challenges and underlying tenant difficulties. 

The commercial allowance for loan and lease losses increased $3.6 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2020 to $8.4 billion due to the deterioration in the economic outlook resulting from the impact of COVID-19. For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 44 . 

Total commercial utilized credit exposure increased $32.3 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2020 to $667.7 billion driven by higher loans and leases. The utilization rate for loans and leases, standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and financial guarantees, and commercial letters of credit, in the aggregate, was 60 percent at June 30, 2020 and 58 percent at December 31, 2019 . 

Table 30 presents commercial credit exposure by type for utilized, unfunded and total binding committed credit exposure. Commercial utilized credit exposure includes SBLCs and financial guarantees and commercial letters of credit that have been issued and for which we are legally bound to advance funds under prescribed conditions during a specified time period, and excludes exposure related to trading account assets. Although funds have not yet been advanced, these exposure types are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes.

Commercial and Industrial 

Commercial and industrial loans include U.S. commercial and non-U.S. commercial portfolios. 

U.S. Commercial 

At June 30, 2020 , 69 percent of the U.S. commercial loan portfolio, excluding small business, was managed in Global Banking, 15 percent in Global Markets , 13 percent in GWIM (generally business-purpose loans for high net worth clients) and the remainder primarily in Consumer Banking . U.S. commercial loans increased $6.9 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2020 across most lines of business. Reservable criticized utilized exposure increased $10.4 billion , or 125 percent , driven by the impact of COVID-19 and was broad-based across industries. 

Non-U.S. Commercial 

At June 30, 2020 , 82 percent of the non-U.S. commercial loan portfolio was managed in Global Banking and 17 percent in Global Markets . Non-U.S. commercial loans decreased $1.3 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2020 , primarily in Global Banking . For information on the non-U.S. commercial portfolio, see Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 43 . 

Commercial Real Estate 

Commercial real estate primarily includes commercial loans secured by non-owner-occupied real estate and is dependent on 

&#160;

the sale or lease of the real estate as the primary source of repayment. Outstanding loans increased $1.4 billion , or two percent , during the six months ended June 30, 2020 to $64.1 billion due to new originations and increased utilizations under existing credit facilities outpacing paydowns. The portfolio remains diversified across property types and geographic regions. California represented the largest state concentration at 23 percent and 24 percent of the commercial real estate portfolio at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . The commercial real estate portfolio is predominantly managed in Global Banking and consists of loans made primarily to public and private developers, and commercial real estate firms. 

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , we continued to see low default rates and varying degrees of weakness in the non-residential portfolio. We use a number of proactive risk mitigation initiatives to reduce adversely rated exposure in the commercial real estate portfolio, including transfers of deteriorating exposures to management by independent special asset officers and the pursuit of loan restructurings or asset sales to achieve the best results for our customers and the Corporation.

U.S. Small Business Commercial 

The U.S. small business commercial loan portfolio is comprised of small business card loans and small business loans managed in Consumer Banking, including $25.1 billion of PPP loans that were funded through June 30, 2020. Excluding PPP, credit card-related products were 50 percent and 52 percent of the U.S. small business commercial portfolio at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . Of the U.S. small business commercial net charge-offs, 95 percent and 92 percent were credit card-related products for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to 99 percent and 97 percent for the same periods in 2019 . 

Nonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity 

Table 35 presents the nonperforming commercial loans, leases 

&#160;

and foreclosed properties activity during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 . Nonperforming loans do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option. During the six months ended June 30, 2020 , nonperforming commercial loans and leases increased $703 million to $2.2 billion , primarily driven by the impact of COVID-19. At June 30, 2020 , 87 percent of commercial nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties were secured and 65 percent were contractually current. Commercial nonperforming loans were carried at 81 percent of their unpaid principal balance before consideration of the allowance for loan and lease losses as the carrying value of these loans has been reduced to the estimated collateral value less costs to sell.

Commercial loans and leases may be returned to performing status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected, or when the loan otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection. TDRs are generally classified as performing after a sustained period of demonstrated payment performance. 

(4) &#160; 

Outstanding commercial loans exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. 

Table 36 presents our commercial TDRs by product type and performing status. U.S. small business commercial TDRs are comprised of renegotiated small business card loans and small business loans. The renegotiated small business card loans are not classified as nonperforming as they are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days 

&#160;

past due. For more information on our loan modification programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which are not TDRs, see Executive Summary - Recent Developments &#8211; COVID-19 Pandemic on page 3 and Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements .

Industry Concentrations 

Table 37 presents commercial committed and utilized credit exposure by industry and the total net credit default protection purchased to cover the funded and unfunded portions of certain credit exposures. Our commercial credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of industries. Total commercial committed exposure decreased $2.8 billion , less than one percent, during the six months ended June 30, 2020 to $1.1 trillion . The decrease in commercial committed exposure was concentrated in the Asset managers and funds, Utilities, and Global commercial banks industry sectors. Decreases were partially offset by increased exposure to the Healthcare equipment and services, Capital goods, and Automobiles and components industry sectors. 

For information on industry limits, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management - Industry Concentrations in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 

Asset managers and funds, our largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $100.8 billion , decreased $9.3 billion , or eight percent , during the six months ended June 30, 2020 . 

&#160;

Real estate, our second largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $96.1 billion , remained relatively flat during the six months ended June 30, 2020 . For more information on the commercial real estate and related portfolios, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management &#8211; Commercial Real Estate on page 39 . 

Capital goods, our third largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $85.7 billion , increased $4.8 billion , or six percent , during the six months ended June 30, 2020 with the growth largely occurring in the machinery, and aerospace and defense conglomerates categories, partially offset by a decrease in trading companies and distributors, and industrial conglomerates. 

Given the widespread impact the COVID-19 pandemic is having on the U.S. and global economy, a number of industries continue to be adversely impacted. We continue to monitor all industries, particularly higher risk industries, which are continuing to experience a more significant impact to their financial condition. In addition, we continue to assess potential mitigants such as the various stimulus programs designed to support these clients and 

41 &#160; Bank of America 

&#160; 

&#160; 

industries through COVID-19. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has also placed significant stress on global demand for oil, resulting in a steep decline in prices. Our energy-related committed exposure increased $1.1 billion , or three percent , during the six months ended June 30, 2020 to $37.4 billion , driven 

&#160;

by our integrated client exposure, partially offset by a decline in our higher risk exploration and production exposure. For more information on COVID-19, see Executive Summary - Recent Developments &#8211; COVID-19 Pandemic on page 3 .

Risk Mitigation 

We purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain credit exposures. To lower the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, we may add credit exposure within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection. 

At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , net notional credit default protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, was $5.4 billion and $3.3 billion . We recorded net losses on these positions of $231 million and $2 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to net losses of $13 million and $77 million for the same periods in 2019 . The gains and losses on these instruments were offset by gains and losses on the related exposures. The Value-at-Risk (VaR) results for these 

&#160;

exposures are included in the fair value option portfolio information in Table 43 . For more information, see Trading Risk Management on page 46 . 

Tables 38 and 39 present the maturity profiles and the credit exposure debt ratings of the net credit default protection portfolio at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 .

&#160;

Non-U.S. Portfolio 

Our non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios are subject to country risk. We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes in government policies. A risk management framework is in place to measure, monitor and manage non-U.S. risk and exposures. In addition to the direct risk of doing business in a country, we also are exposed to indirect country risks (e.g., related to the collateral received on secured financing transactions or related to client clearing activities). These indirect exposures are managed in the normal course of business through credit, market and operational risk governance, rather than through country risk governance. 

Table 40 presents our 20 largest non-U.S. country exposures at June 30, 2020 . These exposures accounted for 90 percent and 88 percent of our total non-U.S. exposure at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . Net country exposure for these 20 countries increased $43.7 billion in the six months ended June 30, 2020 . The majority of the increase was due to higher deposits with central banks in Germany and Japan.

Our largest non-U.S. country exposure at June 30, 2020 was the U.K. with net exposure of $61.0 billion , which represents a $5.2 billion increase from December 31, 2019 . Our second largest non-U.S. country exposure was Germany with net exposure of $49.9 billion at June 30, 2020 , a $19.1 billion increase from December 31, 2019 . The increase in Germany was primarily driven by an increase in deposits with the central bank. 

In light of the global COVID-19 pandemic, we are monitoring our non-U.S. exposure closely, particularly in countries where restrictions on certain activities, in an attempt to contain the spread and impact of the virus, have affected and will continue to adversely affect economic activity. We are managing the impact 

&#160;

to our international business operations as part of our overall response framework and are taking actions to manage exposure carefully in impacted regions while supporting the needs of our clients. The magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its full impact on the global economy continue to be highly uncertain. The impact of COVID-19 could have an adverse impact on the global economy for a prolonged period of time. For more information on how the COVID-19 pandemic may affect our operations, see Executive Summary - Recent Developments &#8211; COVID-19 Pandemic on page 3 and Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors on page 104 .

Allowance for Credit Losses 

On January 1, 2020 , the Corporation adopted the new accounting standard that requires the measurement of the allowance for credit losses to be based on management&#8217;s best estimate of lifetime ECL inherent in the Corporation&#8217;s relevant financial assets. Upon adoption of the new accounting standard, the Corporation recorded a net increase of $3.3 billion in the allowance for credit losses which was comprised of a net increase of $2.9 billion in the allowance for loan and lease losses and an increase of $310 million in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The net 

&#160;

increase was primarily driven by a $3.1 billion increase related to the credit card portfolio. 

The allowance for credit losses further increased by $7.6 billion at June 30, 2020 , which included a $4.5 billion increase in the commercial portfolio and a $3.1 billion increase in the consumer portfolio. The increases were primarily due to the weaker economic outlook resulting from the impact of COVID-19. The following table presents an allocation of the allowance for credit losses by product type for June 30, 2020 , January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2019 (prior to the adoption of the CECL accounting standard).

(1) &#160; 

Ratios are calculated as allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of loans and leases outstanding excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option. Consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option include residential mortgage loans of $330 million at June 30, 2020 and $257 million at January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2019 and home equity loans of $354 million at June 30, 2020 and $337 million at January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . Commercial loans accounted for under the fair value option include U.S. commercial loans of $5.1 billion , $5.1 billion and $4.7 billion at June 30, 2020 , January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively and non-U.S. commercial loans of $3.4 billion , $3.2 billion and $3.1 billion at June 30, 2020 , January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively. 

(2) &#160; 

Includes allowance for loan and lease losses for U.S. small business commercial loans of $1.4 billion , $831 million and $523 million at June 30, 2020 , January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively. 

n/m = not meaningful 

Net charge-offs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 were $1.1 billion and $2.3 billion compared to $887 million and $1.9 billion for the same periods in 2019 driven by increases in commercial losses. The provision for credit losses increased $4.3 billion to $5.1 billion , and $8.0 billion to $9.9 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 . The provision for credit losses was $4.0 billion and $7.6 billion higher than net charge-offs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , which was primarily due to the deterioration in the economic outlook resulting from the impact of COVID-19 on both the consumer and commercial portfolios. The provision for credit losses for the consumer portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, increased $2.0 billion to $2.6 billion and $3.2 billion to $4.7 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 . The 

&#160;

provision for credit losses for the commercial portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, increased $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion and $4.8 billion to $5.2 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019 . 

The following table presents a rollforward of the allowance for credit losses, including certain loan and allowance ratios for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 , noting that measurement of the allowance for credit losses for 2019 was based on management&#8217;s estimate of probable incurred losses. For more information on the Corporation&#8217;s credit loss accounting policies and activity related to the allowance for credit losses, see Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 5 &#8211; Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements .

Market Risk Management 

For more information on our market risk management process, see Market Risk Management in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 

Market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions may adversely impact the value of assets or liabilities, or otherwise negatively impact earnings. This risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations, primarily within our Global Markets segment. We are also exposed to these risks in other areas of the Corporation (e.g., our ALM activities). In the event of market stress, these risks could have a material impact on our results. 

We have been affected, and expect to continue to be affected, by market stress resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic that began in the first quarter of 2020. For more information on the effects of the pandemic, see Executive Summary - Recent Developments &#8211; COVID-19 Pandemic on page 3 . 

Trading Risk Management 

To evaluate risks in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of revenues generated by individual positions as well as portfolios of positions. VaR is a common statistic used to measure market risk. Our primary VaR statistic is equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level, which means that for a VaR with a one-day holding period, there should not be losses in excess of VaR, on average, 99 out of 100 trading days. 

&#160;

Table 43 presents the total market-based portfolio VaR which is the combination of the total covered positions (and less liquid trading positions) portfolio and the fair value option portfolio. For more information on the market risk VaR for trading activities, see Trading Risk Management in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 

The total market-based portfolio VaR results in Table 43 include market risk to which we are exposed from all business segments, excluding credit valuation adjustment (CVA), DVA and related hedges. The majority of this portfolio is within the Global Markets segment. 

Table 43 presents period-end, average, high and low daily trading VaR for the three months ended June 30, 2020 , March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2019 using a 99 percent confidence level, as well as average daily trading VaR for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 . The amounts disclosed in Table 43 and Table 44 align to the view of covered positions used in the Basel 3 capital calculations. Foreign exchange and commodity positions are always considered covered positions, regardless of trading or banking treatment for the trade, except for structural foreign currency positions that are excluded with prior regulatory approval. 

The average of total covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio VaR increased for the three months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the prior quarter primarily due to the impact of market volatility stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic in the look-back period.

The high and low for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the high and low for the components. Therefore the impact from less liquid exposures and the amount of portfolio diversification, which is the difference between the total portfolio and the sum of the individual components, is not relevant. 

The graph below presents the daily covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio VaR for the previous five quarters, corresponding to the data in Table 43 . Peak VaR in mid-March 2020 was driven by increased market realized volatility and higher implied volatilities. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Bank of America &#160; 46 

Additional VaR statistics produced within our single VaR model are provided in Table 44 at the same level of detail as in Table 43 . Evaluating VaR with additional statistics allows for an increased understanding of the risks in the portfolio as the historical market data used in the VaR calculation does not necessarily follow a predefined statistical distribution. Table 44 presents average 

&#160;

trading VaR statistics at 99 percent and 95 percent confidence levels for the three months ended June 30, 2020 , March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2019 . The increase in VaR for the 99 percent confidence level for the three months ended June 30, 2020 was primarily due to higher model volatility based on March 2020 market data included in the calibration of the VaR model.

Backtesting 

The accuracy of the VaR methodology is evaluated by backtesting, which compares the daily VaR results, utilizing a one-day holding period, against a comparable subset of trading revenue. For more information on our backtesting process, see Trading Risk Management &#8211; Backtesting in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 , there were zero days and seven days respectively where this subset of trading revenue had losses that exceeded our total covered portfolio VaR, utilizing a one-day holding period. 

Total Trading-related Revenue 

Total trading-related revenue, excluding brokerage fees, and CVA, DVA and funding valuation adjustment gains (losses), represents the total amount earned from trading positions, including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. For more information, see Trading Risk Management &#8211; Total Trading-related Revenue in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 

The following histogram is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020 . During the three months ended June 30, 2020 , positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 100 percent of the trading days, of which 95 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million. This compares to the three months ended March 31, 2020 where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 94 percent of the trading days, of which 89 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million. 

&#160;

Trading Portfolio Stress Testing 

Because the very nature of a VaR model suggests results can exceed our estimates and it is dependent on a limited historical window, we also stress test our portfolio using scenario analysis. This analysis estimates the change in the value of our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements. For more information, see Trading Risk Management &#8211; Trading Portfolio Stress Testing in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K .

Table 46 shows the pretax impact to forecasted net interest income over the next 12 months from June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 resulting from instantaneous parallel and non-parallel shocks to the market-based forward curve. Periodically we evaluate the scenarios presented so that they are meaningful in the context of the current rate environment. The interest rate scenarios also assume U.S. dollar rates are floored at zero. 

In the six months ended June 30, 2020 , the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet increased in up-rate scenarios primarily due to lower rates and higher cash levels. Asset sensitivity of our balance sheet decreased in down-rate scenarios due to interest rate floors. We continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel move in interest rates with the majority of that impact coming from the short end of the yield curve. Additionally, higher interest rates impact the fair value of debt securities and, accordingly, for debt securities classified as AFS, may adversely affect OCI and thus capital levels under the Basel 3 capital rules. Under instantaneous upward parallel shifts, the near-term adverse impact to Basel 3 capital is reduced over time by offsetting positive impacts to net interest income. For more information on Basel 3, see Capital Management &#8211; Regulatory Capital on page 23 .

The sensitivity analysis in Table 46 assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shocks and does not assume any change in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates. As part of our ALM activities, we use securities, certain residential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity. 

&#160;

The behavior of our deposits portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income. The sensitivity analysis in Table 46 assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce our benefit in those scenarios. 

Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative Contracts 

Interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts are utilized in our ALM activities and serve as an efficient tool to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk. We use derivatives to hedge the variability in cash flows or changes in fair value on our balance sheet due to interest rate and foreign exchange components. For more information on our hedging activities, see Note 3 &#8211; Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements . For more information on interest rate contracts and risk management, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 

We use interest rate derivative instruments to hedge the variability in the cash flows of our assets and liabilities and other forecasted transactions (collectively referred to as cash flow hedges). The net results on both open and terminated cash flow hedge derivative instruments recorded in accumulated OCI were a gain of $454 million and a loss of $496 million , on a pretax basis, at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . These gains (losses) are expected to be reclassified into earnings in the same period as the hedged cash flows affect earnings and will decrease income or increase expense on the respective hedged cash flows. Assuming no change in open cash flow derivative hedge positions and no changes in prices or interest rates beyond what is implied in forward yield curves at June 30, 2020 , the after-tax net gains are expected to be reclassified into earnings as follows: a gain of $189 million within the next year, a gain of $298 million in years two through five, a loss of $96 million in years six through ten, with the remaining loss of $59 million thereafter. For more information on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, see Note 3 &#8211; Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements . 

We hedge our net investment in non-U.S. operations determined to have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar using forward foreign exchange contracts that typically settle in less than 180 days, cross-currency basis swaps and foreign exchange options. We recorded net after-tax losses on derivatives in accumulated OCI associated with net investment hedges which were offset by gains on our net investments in consolidated non-U.S. entities at June 30, 2020 . 

Table 47 presents derivatives utilized in our ALM activities and shows the notional amount, fair value, weighted-average receive-fixed and pay-fixed rates, expected maturity and average estimated durations of our open ALM derivatives at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . These amounts do not include derivative hedges on our MSRs. During the six months ended June 30, 2020 , the fair value of receive-fixed interest rate swaps increased while pay-fixed interest swaps decreased, primarily driven by lower swap rates on hedges of U.S. dollar long-term debt.

Mortgage Banking Risk Management 

We originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. We determine whether loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate. 

Changes in interest rates impact the value of interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and the related residential first mortgage loans held-for-sale (LHFS), as well as the value of the MSRs. Because the interest rate risks of these hedged items offset, we combine them into one overall hedged item with one combined economic hedge portfolio consisting of derivative contracts and securities. For more information on IRLCs and the related residential mortgage LHFS, see Mortgage Banking Risk Management in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 , we recorded gains of $65 million and $228 million related to the change in fair value of the MSRs, IRLCs and LHFS, net of 

&#160;

gains and losses on the hedge portfolio, compared to gains of $78 million and $139 million for the same periods in 2019 . 

Complex Accounting Estimates 

Our significant accounting principles are essential in understanding the MD&#38;A. Many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. We have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments. For more information, see Complex Accounting Estimates in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation&#8217;s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as noted below under Allowance for Credit Losses, there have not been any material updates to our complex accounting estimates as disclosed in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K.

&#160; 

&#160; 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

On January 1, 2020 , the Corporation adopted the new accounting standard that requires the measurement of the allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, to be based on management&#8217;s best estimate of lifetime ECL inherent in the Corporation's relevant financial assets. 

The Corporation's estimate of lifetime ECL includes the use of quantitative models that incorporate forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios that are applied over the contractual life of the loan portfolios, adjusted for expected prepayments and borrower controlled extension options. These macroeconomic scenarios include variables that have historically been key drivers of increases and decreases in credit losses. These variables include, but are not limited to, unemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product levels, corporate bond spreads and long-term interest rate forecasts. As any one economic outlook is inherently uncertain, the Corporation leverages multiple scenarios. The scenarios that are chosen each quarter and the amount of weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors including recent economic events, leading economic indicators, views of internal and third-party economists and industry trends. 

The Corporation also includes qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but, in the Corporation's assessment, may not be adequately represented in the economic assumptions described above. For example, factors that the Corporation considers include changes in lending policies and procedures, business conditions, the nature and size of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such as competition, and legal and regulatory requirements, among others. Further, the Corporation considers the inherent uncertainty in quantitative models that are built on historical data. 

The allowance for credit losses can also be impacted by unanticipated changes in asset quality of the portfolio, such as increases in risk rating downgrades in our commercial portfolio, deterioration in borrower delinquencies or credit scores in our credit card portfolio or increases in LTVs in our consumer real estate portfolio. In addition, while we have incorporated our estimated impact of COVID-19 into our allowance for credit losses, the ultimate impact of the pandemic is still unknown, including how long economic activities will be impacted and what effect the unprecedented levels of government fiscal and monetary actions will have on the economy and our credit losses. 

As described above, the process to determine the allowance for credit losses requires numerous estimates and assumptions, some of which require a high degree of judgment and are often interrelated. Changes in the estimates and assumptions can result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses. Our process for determining the allowance for credit losses is further discussed in Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 5 &#8211; Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements .

We perform goodwill impairment testing at least annually, unless indicators of impairment exist in interim periods. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of June 30, 2020 . In performing that test, we compared the fair value of each reporting unit to its estimated carrying value as measured by allocated equity. We estimated the fair value of each reporting unit based on the income approach (which utilizes the present value of cash flows to estimate fair value) and the market multiplier approach (which utilizes observable market prices and metrics of peer companies to estimate fair value). 

Our discounted cash flows were generally based on the Corporation&#8217;s three-year internal forecasts with a long-term growth rate of 3.68 percent. Our estimated cash flows take into account the current challenging global industry and market conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the low interest rate environment. The cash flows were discounted using rates that range from 9 percent to 12 percent, which were derived from a capital asset pricing model that incorporates the risk and uncertainty in the cash flow forecasts, the financial markets and industries similar to each of the reporting units. 

Under the market multiplier approach, we estimated the fair value of the individual reporting units utilizing various market multiples, primarily various pricing multiples, from comparable publicly-traded companies in industries similar to the reporting unit and then factored in a control premium based upon observed comparable premiums paid for change-in-control transactions for financial institutions. 

Based on the results of the test, we determined that each reporting unit&#8217;s estimated fair value exceeded its respective carrying value and that the goodwill assigned to each reporting unit, as of June 30, 2020 , was not impaired. The fair values of the reporting units as a percentage of their carrying values ranged from 109 percent to 213 percent. As it currently remains difficult to predict the economic impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we will continue to monitor key assumptions and other factors utilized in our impairment analysis. It is possible that, during the remainder of 2020 , economic and market conditions (both in the U.S. and internationally) could further deteriorate, which could negatively impact our reporting units. If our key assumptions and related estimates change, we may be required to record an impairment charge in the future.
