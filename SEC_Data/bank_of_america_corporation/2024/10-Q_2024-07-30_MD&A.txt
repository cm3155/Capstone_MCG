 Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Bank of America Corporation (the &#8220;Corporation&#8221;) and its management may make certain statements that constitute &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;targets,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;hopes,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221; &#8220;intends,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;goals,&#8221; &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;continue&#8221; and other similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;might,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;would&#8221; and &#8220;could.&#8221; Forward-looking statements represent the Corporation&#8217;s current expectations, plans or forecasts of its future results, revenues, liquidity, net interest income, provision for credit losses, expenses, efficiency ratio, capital measures, strategy, deposits, assets, and future business and economic conditions more generally, and other future matters. These statements are not guarantees of future results or performance and involve certain known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and are often beyond the Corporation&#8217;s control. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, any of these forward-looking statements.

(2) Return on average tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity is a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information and a corresponding reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measures defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 48. 

Net income was $6.9 billion and $13.6 billion, or $0.83 and $1.59 per diluted share, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to $7.4 billion and $15.6 billion, or $0.88 and $1.82 per diluted share, for the same periods in 2023. The decrease in net income was primarily due to higher noninterest expense and provision for credit losses. 

Total assets increased $77.8 billion from December 31, 2023 to $3.3 trillion primarily driven by higher securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell and trading account assets to support Global Markets client activity. 

Total liabilities increased $75.6 billion from December 31, 2023 to $3.0 trillion primarily driven by higher securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase to support Global Markets client activity. 

Shareholders&#8217; equity increased $2.2 billion from December 31, 2023 primarily due to net income, partially offset by returns of capital to shareholders through common stock repurchases, common and preferred stock dividends, and preferred stock redemptions. 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income decreased $456 million to $13.7 billion, and $872 million to $27.7 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. Net interest yield on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis decreased 13 basis points (bps) to 1.93 percent and 17 bps to 1.96 percent for the same periods. The decreases were primarily driven by higher deposit costs, partially offset by higher asset yields and higher net interest income related to Global Markets activity. For more information on net interest yield and FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 6, and for more information on interest rate risk management, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 44.

Noninterest Income 

Table 2 Noninterest Income Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 (Dollars in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Fees and commissions: Card income $ 1,581 &#160; $ 1,546 $ 3,044 &#160; $ 3,015 Service charges 1,507 &#160; 1,364 2,949 &#160; 2,774 Investment and brokerage services 4,320 &#160; 3,839 8,507 &#160; 7,691 Investment banking fees 1,561 &#160; 1,212 3,129 &#160; 2,375 Total fees and commissions 8,969 &#160; 7,961 17,629 &#160; 15,855 Market making and similar activities 3,298 &#160; 3,697 7,186 &#160; 8,409 Other income (592) (619) (1,354) (1,415) Total noninterest income $ 11,675 &#160; $ 11,039 $ 23,461 &#160; $ 22,849 

Noninterest income increased $636 million to $11.7 billion and $612 million to $23.5 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. The following highlights the significant changes. 

&#9679; Service charges increased $143 million and $175 million primarily driven by higher treasury service charges. 

&#9679; Investment and brokerage services increased $481 million and $816 million primarily driven by higher asset management fees due to higher average equity market valuations and positive assets under management (AUM) flows, partially offset by the impact of lower AUM pricing. 

&#9679; Investment banking fees increased $349 million and $754 million primarily due to higher debt and equity issuance fees. 

&#9679; Market making and similar activities decreased $399 million and $1.2 billion primarily driven by lower trading revenue from macro products in Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC). The decreases were partially offset by higher trading revenue in Equities. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses increased $383 million to $1.5 billion and $771 million to $2.8 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. The provision for credit losses for the current-year periods was primarily driven by credit card loans and the commercial real estate office portfolio, partially offset by an improved macroeconomic outlook. For more information on the provision for credit losses, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 40. 

Noninterest Expense 

Table 3 Noninterest Expense Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 (Dollars in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Compensation and benefits $ 9,826 &#160; $ 9,401 $ 20,021 &#160; $ 19,319 Occupancy and equipment 1,818 &#160; 1,776 3,629 &#160; 3,575 Information processing and communications 1,763 &#160; 1,644 3,563 &#160; 3,341 Product delivery and transaction related 891 &#160; 956 1,742 &#160; 1,846 Marketing 487 &#160; 513 942 &#160; 971 Professional fees 654 &#160; 527 1,202 &#160; 1,064 Other general operating 870 &#160; 1,221 2,447 &#160; 2,160 Total noninterest expense $ 16,309 &#160; $ 16,038 $ 33,546 &#160; $ 32,276 

Noninterest expense increased $271 million to $16.3 billion and $1.3 billion to $33.5 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. The increases in both periods were primarily driven by higher investments in people and revenue-related compensation, 

partially offset by lower litigation expense. The increase in the six-month period also included the additional accrual of $700 million for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) special assessment recorded in the first quarter of 2024, as well as higher investments in technology.

Income Tax Expense 

Table 4 Income Tax Expense Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 (Dollars in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Income before income taxes $ 7,560 &#160; $ 8,034 $ 14,822 &#160; $ 17,123 Income tax expense 663 &#160; 626 1,251 &#160; 1,554 Effective tax rate 8.8 &#160; % 7.8 % 8.4 &#160; % 9.1 % 

The effective tax rates for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 were primarily driven by our recurring tax preference benefits that mainly consist of tax credits from investments in affordable housing and renewable energy. Also included in the effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was the discrete benefit from the $700 million charge recorded in the first quarter for the FDIC special assessment. Absent the tax credits and discrete tax benefits, the effective tax rates would have been approximately 25 percent and 26 percent for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 and 26 percent for both the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Supplemental Financial Data 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we present certain non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items or otherwise include components that differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are provided as additional useful information to assess our financial condition, results of operations (including period-to-period operating performance) or compliance with prospective regulatory requirements. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may not be defined or calculated the same way as non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. 

When presented on a consolidated basis, we view net interest income on an FTE basis as a non-GAAP financial measure. To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 21 percent and a representative state tax rate. Net interest yield, which measures the basis points we earn over the cost of funds, utilizes net interest income on an FTE basis. We believe that presentation of these items on an FTE basis allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practices. 

We may present certain key performance indicators and ratios excluding certain items (e.g., debit valuation adjustment (DVA) gains (losses)), which result in non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that the presentation of measures that exclude these items is useful because such measures provide additional information to assess the underlying operational performance and trends of our businesses and to allow better comparison of period-to-period operating performance. 

We also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible equity represents shareholders&#8217; equity or common 

shareholders&#8217; equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)), net of related deferred tax liabilities (&#8220;adjusted&#8221; shareholders&#8217; equity or common shareholders&#8217; equity). These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models use both return on average tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity and return on average tangible shareholders&#8217; equity as key measures to support our overall growth objectives. These ratios are: 

&#9679; Return on average tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity measures our net income applicable to common shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average common shareholders&#8217; equity. The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders&#8217; equity divided by total tangible assets. 

&#9679; Return on average tangible shareholders&#8217; equity measures our net income as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders&#8217; equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders&#8217; equity divided by total tangible assets. 

&#9679; Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders&#8217; equity divided by ending common shares outstanding. 

We believe ratios utilizing tangible equity provide additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. Tangible book value per common share provides additional useful information about the level of tangible assets in relation to outstanding shares of common stock. 

The aforementioned supplemental data and performance measures are presented in Table 5 on page 7. 

For more information on the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 48. 

Key Performance Indicators 

We present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance indicators (key performance indicators) that management uses when assessing our consolidated and/or segment results. We believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information about our underlying operational performance and trends. These key performance indicators (KPIs) may not be defined or calculated in the same way as similar KPIs used by other companies. For information on how these metrics are defined, see Key Metrics on page 103. 

Our consolidated key performance indicators, which include various equity and credit metrics, are presented in Table 1 on page 4 and Table 5 on page 7. 

For information on key segment performance metrics, see Business Segment Operations on page 10.

Business Segment Operations 

Segment Description and Basis of Presentation 

We report our results of operations through four business segments: Consumer Banking, GWIM, Global Banking and Global Markets , with the remaining operations recorded in All Other . We manage our segments and report their results on an FTE basis. For more information, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

We periodically review capital allocated to our businesses and allocate capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes. We utilize a methodology that considers the effect of regulatory capital requirements in addition to internal risk-based capital models. The capital allocated to the business segments is referred to as allocated capital. Allocated equity in the reporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital 

for the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the reporting unit. For more information, including the definition of a reporting unit, see Note 7 &#8211; Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

For more information on our presentation of financial information on an FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 6, and for reconciliations to consolidated total revenue, net income and period-end total assets, see Note 17 &#8211; Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Key Performance Indicators 

We present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance indicators that management uses when evaluating segment results. We believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information about our segments&#8217; operational performance, client trends and business growth.

Noninterest expense decreased $231 million to $261 million primarily due to lower expenses related to a liquidating business activity. 

The income tax benefit decreased $153 million to $1.8 billion due to lower tax preference benefits primarily related to 

tax credit investment activity. Both periods included income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking and Global Markets . 

Six-Month Comparison 

The net loss in All Other increased $657 million to $946 million primarily due to higher noninterest expense. 

Noninterest expense increased $356 million to $1.3 billion primarily due to a $700 million accrual for the increase in the Corporation&#8217;s estimated share of the FDIC special assessment, partially offset by lower expenses related to a liquidating business activity. 

The income tax benefit was $3.7 billion, relatively unchanged from the same period a year ago. Both periods included income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking and Global Markets.

Managing Risk 

Risk is inherent in all our business activities. The seven key types of risk faced by the Corporation are strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational. Sound risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver for our shareholders. If not managed well, risk can result in financial loss, regulatory sanctions and penalties, and damage to our reputation, each of which may adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategies. We take a comprehensive approach to risk management with a defined Risk Framework and an articulated Risk Appetite Statement, which are approved annually by the Enterprise Risk Committee and the Board. 

Our Risk Framework serves as the foundation for the consistent and effective management of risks facing the Corporation. The Risk Framework sets forth roles and responsibilities for the management of risk and provides a blueprint for how the Board, through delegation of authority to committees and executive officers, establishes risk appetite and associated limits for our activities. 

Our risk appetite provides a common framework that includes a set of measures to assist senior management and the Board in assessing the Corporation&#8217;s risk profile across all risk types against our risk appetite and risk capacity. Our risk appetite is formally articulated in the Risk Appetite Statement, which includes both qualitative statements and quantitative limits. 

For more information on the Corporation&#8217;s risks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation&#8217;s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risks are being managed within our Risk Framework and supporting risk management programs. For more information on our Risk Framework, risk management activities and the key types of risk faced by the Corporation, see the Managing Risk section in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Capital Management 

The Corporation manages its capital position so that its capital is more than adequate to support its business activities and aligns with risk, risk appetite and strategic planning. For more information, see Capital Management in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

CCAR and Capital Planning 

The Federal Reserve requires BHCs to submit a capital plan and planned capital actions on an annual basis, consistent with the rules governing the CCAR capital plan, which includes supervisory stress testing by the Federal Reserve. We submitted our 2024 CCAR capital plan and related supervisory stress tests in April 2024 and received our results on June 26, 2024. Based on the results, our SCB is expected to be 3.2 percent, and the CET1 minimum requirement will be 10.7 percent when finalized. The new SCB will be effective from October 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025. 

The Board has authorized the repurchase of up to $25 billion of common stock over time, which includes common stock repurchases to offset shares awarded under the Corporation&#8217;s equity-based compensation plans. Pursuant to Board authorization, during the three months ended June 30, 2024, we repurchased $3.5 billion of common stock. For more 

information, see Part II, Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds on page 105 and Capital Management &#8211; CCAR and Capital Planning in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

On July 24, 2024, the Corporation&#8217;s Board authorized a $25 billion common stock repurchase program, effective August 1, 2024, to replace the Corporation&#8217;s existing program adopted by the Board in October 2021 and subsequently modified in September 2023. The existing repurchase program will expire on August 1, 2024. 

The timing and amount of common stock repurchases are subject to various factors, including the Corporation&#8217;s capital position, liquidity, financial performance and alternative uses of capital, stock trading price, regulatory requirements and general market conditions, and may be suspended at any time. Such repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including repurchase plans that satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). 

Regulatory Capital 

As a BHC, we are subject to regulatory capital rules, including Basel 3, issued by U.S. banking regulators. The Corporation's depository institution subsidiaries are also subject to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework. The Corporation and its primary affiliated banking entity, BANA, are Advanced approaches institutions under Basel 3 and are required to report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and risk-weighted assets (RWA) under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The lower of the capital ratios under Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements is used to assess capital adequacy, including under the PCA framework. As of June 30, 2024, the CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios under the Standardized approach were the binding ratios. 

Minimum Capital Requirements 

In order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, the Corporation must meet risk-based capital ratio requirements that include a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent (under the Advanced approaches only), an SCB (under the Standardized approach only), plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer and a global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge. The buffers and surcharge must be comprised solely of CET1 capital. For the period from January 1, 2024 through September 30, 2024, the Corporation's minimum CET1 capital ratio requirements are 10.0 percent under both the Standardized approach and the Advanced approaches. 

The Corporation is required to calculate its G-SIB surcharge on an annual basis under two methods and is subject to the higher of the resulting two surcharges. Method 1 is consistent with the approach prescribed by the Basel Committee&#8217;s assessment methodology and is calculated using specified indicators of systemic importance. Method 2 modifies the Method 1 approach by, among other factors, including a measure of the Corporation&#8217;s reliance on short-term wholesale funding. Effective January 1, 2024, the Corporation&#8217;s G-SIB surcharge, which is higher under Method 2, increased 50 bps, resulting in an increase in our minimum CET1 capital ratio 

21 Bank of America 

requirement under the Standardized approach to 10.0 percent from 9.5 percent. At June 30, 2024, the Corporation&#8217;s CET1 capital ratio of 11.9 percent under the Standardized approach exceeded its CET1 capital ratio requirement. 

The Corporation is also required to maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. At June 30, 2024, our insured depository institution subsidiaries exceeded their requirement to 

maintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be considered well capitalized under the PCA framework.

(1) Capital ratios as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are calculated using the regulatory capital rule that allows a five-year transition period related to the adoption of the current expected credit losses (CECL) accounting standard on January 1, 2020. 

(2) The CET1 capital regulatory minimum is the sum of the CET1 capital ratio minimum of 4.5 percent, our G-SIB surcharge of 3.0 percent at June 30, 2024 and 2.5 percent at December 31, 2023, and our capital conservation buffer (under the Advanced approaches) or SCB (under the Standardized approach) of 2.5 percent, as applicable. The countercyclical capital buffer was zero for both periods. The SLR regulatory minimum includes a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent. 

(3) Total capital under the Advanced approaches differs from the Standardized approach due to differences in the amount permitted in Tier 2 capital related to the qualifying allowance for credit losses. 

(4) Reflects total average assets adjusted for certain Tier 1 capital deductions. 

At June 30, 2024, CET1 capital was $198.1 billion, an increase of $3.2 billion from December 31, 2023, primarily due to earnings, partially offset by capital distributions. Tier 1 capital increased $1.3 billion primarily driven by the same factors as CET1 capital, partially offset by preferred stock redemptions. Total capital under the Standardized approach increased $35 million primarily due to the same factors driving the increase in Tier 1 capital and an increase in the adjusted allowance for 

credit losses included in Tier 2 capital, largely offset by a decrease in subordinated debt. RWA under the Standardized approach, which yielded the lower CET1 capital ratio at June 30, 2024, increased $10.2 billion during 2024 to $1,661 billion primarily driven by client activity in Global Markets and lending activity in GWIM . Supplementary leverage exposure at June 30, 2024 increased $80.2 billion primarily driven by increased activity in Global Markets and ALM activities in All Other.

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity Requirements 

Total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) consists of the Corporation&#8217;s Tier 1 capital and eligible long-term debt issued directly by the Corporation. Eligible long-term debt for TLAC ratios is comprised of unsecured debt that has a remaining maturity of at least one year and satisfies additional requirements as prescribed in the TLAC final rule. As with the 

risk-based capital ratios and SLR, the Corporation is required to maintain TLAC ratios in excess of minimum requirements plus applicable buffers to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. Table 12 presents the Corporation's TLAC and long-term debt ratios and related information as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

(2) The TLAC RWA regulatory minimum consists of 18.0 percent plus a TLAC RWA buffer comprised of 2.5 percent plus the Method 1 G-SIB surcharge of 1.5 percent. The countercyclical buffer is zero for both periods. The TLAC supplementary leverage exposure regulatory minimum consists of 7.5 percent plus a 2.0 percent TLAC leverage buffer. The TLAC RWA and leverage buffers must be comprised solely of CET1 capital and Tier 1 capital, respectively. 

(3) The long-term debt RWA regulatory minimum is comprised of 6.0 percent plus the Corporation&#8217;s G-SIB surcharge of 3.0 percent at June 30, 2024 and 2.5 percent at December 31, 2023. The long-term debt leverage exposure regulatory minimum is 4.5 percent. Effective January 1, 2024, the Corporation&#8217;s G-SIB surcharge, which is higher under Method 2, increased 50 bps, resulting in an increase in our long-term debt RWA regulatory minimum requirement to 9.0 percent from 8.5 percent.

Regulatory Developments 

For information on regulatory developments, see Capital Management &#8211; Regulatory Developments in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Regulatory Capital and Securities Regulation 

The Corporation&#8217;s principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are BofA Securities, Inc. (BofAS) and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &#38; Smith Incorporated (MLPF&#38;S). The Corporation's principal European subsidiaries undertaking broker-dealer activities are Merrill Lynch International (MLI) and BofA Securities Europe SA (BofASE). 

The U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the net capital requirements of Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act. BofAS computes its capital requirements as an alternative net capital broker-dealer under Rule 15c3-1e, and MLPF&#38;S computes its capital requirements in accordance with the alternative standard under Rule 15c3-1. BofAS is registered as a futures commission merchant and is subject to Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Regulation 1.17. The U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are also registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA). Pursuant to FINRA Rule 4110, FINRA may impose higher net capital requirements than Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act with respect to each of the broker-dealers. 

BofAS provides institutional services, and in accordance with the alternative net capital requirements, is required to maintain tentative net capital in excess of $5.0 billion and net capital in excess of the greater of $1.0 billion or a certain percentage of its reserve requirement in addition to a certain percentage of securities-based swap risk margin. BofAS must also notify the SEC in the event its tentative net capital is less than $6.0 billion. BofAS is also required to hold a certain percentage of its customers' and affiliates' risk-based margin in order to meet its CFTC minimum net capital requirement. At June 30, 2024, BofAS had tentative net capital of $22.0 billion. BofAS also had regulatory net capital of $19.3 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement of $4.1 billion. 

MLPF&#38;S provides retail services. At June 30, 2024, MLPF&#38;S' regulatory net capital was $4.2 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement of $158 million. 

Our European broker-dealers are subject to requirements from U.S. and non-U.S. regulators. MLI, a U.K. investment firm, is regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority and is subject to certain regulatory 

capital requirements. At June 30, 2024, MLI&#8217;s capital resources were $33.8 billion, which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $12.1 billion. 

BofASE, an authorized credit institution with its head office located in France, is regulated by the Autorit&#233; de Contr&#244;le Prudentiel et de R&#233;solution and the Autorit&#233; des March&#233;s Financiers, and supervised under the Single Supervisory Mechanism by the European Central Bank. At June 30, 2024, BofASE's capital resources were $9.8 billion, which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $3.5 billion. 

In addition, MLI and BofASE remained conditionally registered with the SEC as security-based swap dealers, and maintained net liquid assets at June 30, 2024 that exceeded the applicable minimum requirements under the Exchange Act. The entities are also registered as swap dealers with the CFTC and met applicable capital requirements at June 30, 2024. 

Liquidity Risk 

Funding and Liquidity Risk Management 

Our primary liquidity risk management objective is to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral requirements, including payments under long-term debt agreements, commitments to extend credit and customer deposit withdrawals, while continuing to support our businesses and customers under a range of economic conditions. To achieve that objective, we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk under expected and stressed conditions, maintain liquidity and access to diverse funding sources, including our stable deposit base, and seek to align liquidity-related incentives and risks. These liquidity risk management practices have allowed us to effectively manage market fluctuations from the rising interest rate environment, inflationary pressures and changes in the macroeconomic environment. 

We define liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we can use to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations as they arise. We manage our liquidity position through line-of-business and ALM activities, as well as through our legal entity funding strategy, on both a forward and current (including intraday) basis under both expected and stressed conditions. We believe that a centralized approach to funding and liquidity management enhances our ability to monitor liquidity requirements, maximizes access to funding sources, 

25 Bank of America 

minimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely responses to liquidity events. For more information on the Corporation&#8217;s liquidity risks, see the Liquidity section within Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation&#8217;s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more information regarding global funding and liquidity risk management, as well as liquidity sources, liquidity arrangements, contingency planning and credit ratings discussed below, see Liquidity Risk in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

NB Holdings Corporation 

Bank of America Corporation, as the parent company (the Parent), which is a separate and distinct legal entity from our bank and nonbank subsidiaries, has an intercompany arrangement with our wholly-owned holding company subsidiary, NB Holdings Corporation (NB Holdings). We have transferred, and agreed to transfer, additional Parent assets not required to satisfy anticipated near-term expenditures to NB Holdings. The Parent is expected to continue to have access to the same flow of dividends, interest and other amounts of cash necessary to service its debt, pay dividends and perform other obligations as it would have had it not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets. These arrangements support our preferred single point of entry resolution strategy, under which only the Parent would be resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 

Global Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered Assets 

We maintain liquidity available to the Corporation, including the Parent and selected subsidiaries, in the form of cash and high- quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. Our liquidity buffer, referred to as Global Liquidity Sources (GLS), is comprised of assets that are readily available to the Parent and selected subsidiaries, including holding company, bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, even during stressed market conditions. Our cash is primarily on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank and, to a lesser extent, central banks outside of the U.S. We limit the composition of high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities to U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities and other investment-grade securities, and a select group of non-U.S. government securities. We can obtain cash for these securities, even in stressed conditions, through repurchase agreements or outright sales. We hold our GLS in legal entities that allow us to meet the liquidity requirements of our global businesses, and we consider the impact of potential regulatory, tax, legal and other restrictions that could limit the transferability of funds among entities. 

Table 13 presents average GLS for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

(1) Nonbank includes Parent, NB Holdings and other regulated entities. 

Our bank subsidiaries&#8217; liquidity is primarily driven by deposit and lending activity, as well as securities valuation and net debt activity. Bank subsidiaries can also generate incremental liquidity by pledging a range of unencumbered loans and securities to certain Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) and the 

Federal Reserve Discount Window. The cash we could have obtained by borrowing against this pool of specifically-identified eligible assets was $317 billion and $312 billion at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. We have established operational procedures to enable us to borrow against these assets, including regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible loans and securities collateral. Eligibility is defined in guidelines from the FHLBs and the Federal Reserve and is subject to change at their discretion. Due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries can generally be used only to fund obligations within the bank subsidiaries, and transfers to the Parent or nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to prior regulatory approval. 

Liquidity is also held in nonbank entities, including the Parent, NB Holdings and other regulated entities. The Parent and NB Holdings liquidity is typically in the form of cash deposited at BANA, which is excluded from the liquidity at bank subsidiaries, and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. Liquidity held in other regulated entities, comprised primarily of broker-dealer subsidiaries, is primarily available to meet the obligations of that entity, and transfers to the Parent or to any other subsidiary may be subject to prior regulatory approval due to regulatory restrictions and minimum requirements. Our other regulated entities also hold unencumbered investment-grade securities and equities that we believe could be used to generate additional liquidity. 

Table 14 presents the composition of average GLS for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

Table 14 Average Global Liquidity Sources Composition Three Months Ended (Dollars in billions) June 30 2024 December 31 2023 Cash on deposit $ 344 &#160; $ 380 U.S. Treasury securities 256 &#160; 197 U.S. agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, and other investment-grade securities

Our GLS are substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the final U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) rules. However, HQLA for purposes of calculating LCR is not reported at market value, but at a lower value that incorporates regulatory deductions and the exclusion of excess liquidity held at certain subsidiaries. The LCR is calculated as the amount of a financial institution&#8217;s unencumbered HQLA relative to the estimated net cash outflows the institution could encounter over a 30-day period of significant liquidity stress, expressed as a percentage. Our average consolidated HQLA, on a net basis, was $592 billion and $590 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. For the same periods, the average consolidated LCR was 113 percent and 115 percent. Our LCR fluctuates due to normal business flows from customer activity. 

Liquidity Stress Analysis 

We utilize liquidity stress analysis to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the Parent and our subsidiaries to meet contractual and contingent cash outflows under a range of scenarios. For more information on liquidity stress analysis, see Liquidity Risk &#8211; Liquidity Stress Analysis in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Net Stable Funding Ratio 

The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) is a liquidity requirement for large banks to maintain a minimum level of stable funding over a one-year period. The requirement is intended to support the ability of banks to lend to households and businesses in both normal and adverse economic conditions and is complementary to the LCR, which focuses on short-term liquidity risks. The U.S. NSFR applies to the Corporation on a consolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions. For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the average consolidated NSFR was 120 percent and 119 percent. 

Diversified Funding Sources 

We fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits, and secured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally coordinated funding approach diversified across products, programs, markets, currencies and investor groups. We fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposits, which were $1.91 trillion and $1.92 trillion at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . Our trading activities in other regulated entities are primarily funded on a secured basis through securities lending and repurchase agreements, and these amounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions. 

Deposits 

Our deposit base is well-diversified by clients, geography and product type across our business segments. At June 30, 2024, 50 percent of our deposits were in Consumer Banking , 15 percent in GWIM and 27 percent in Global Banking . We consider a substantial portion of our deposit base to be a stable, low- 

cost and consistent source of liquidity. At June 30, 2024 approximately 68 percent of consumer and small business deposits and 79 percent of U.S. deposits in Global Banking were held by clients who have had accounts with us for 10 or more years. In addition, at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 27 percent and 28 percent of our deposits were noninterest bearing and included operating accounts of our consumer and commercial clients. Deposits at June 30, 2024 decreased $13.3 billion from December 31, 2023 primarily due to seasonal deposit outflows and customers&#8217; movement of balances to higher yielding investment alternatives, partially offset by time deposit growth. 

During the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, rates paid on deposits were 60 bps and 22 bps in Consumer Banking , 314 bps and 235 bps in GWIM , and 318 bps and 224 bps in Global Banking . For information on rates paid on consolidated deposit balances, see Table 6 on page 8. 

Long-term Debt 

During the six months ended June 30, 2024, we issued $29.8 billion of long-term debt consisting of $7.8 billion of notes issued by Bank of America Corporation, which were primarily TLAC compliant, $10.6 billion of notes issued by Bank of America, N.A. and $11.4 billion of other debt. 

During the six months ended June 30, 2024, we had total long-term debt maturities and redemptions in the aggregate of $33.7 billion consisting of $20.9 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $6.8 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $6.0 billion of other debt. Table 15 presents the carrying value of aggregate annual contractual maturities of long-term debt at June 30, 2024.

For more information on our TLAC eligible and callable outstanding notes, see Liquidity Risk &#8211; Diversified Funding Sources in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

(2) Represents liabilities of consolidated variable interest entities (VIEs) included in total long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

Total long-term debt decreased $11.7 billion to $290.5 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2024 primarily due to debt maturities and valuation adjustments, partially offset by debt issuances. We may, from time to time, purchase outstanding debt instruments in various transactions, depending on market conditions, liquidity and other factors. Our other regulated entities may also make markets in our debt instruments to provide liquidity for investors. 

During the six months ended June 30, 2024, we issued $14.2 billion of structured notes, which are debt obligations that pay investors returns linked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. These structured notes are typically issued to meet client demand, and notes with certain attributes may also be TLAC eligible. We typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these liabilities with derivatives and/or investments in the underlying 

27 Bank of America 

instruments, so that from a funding perspective, the cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. We could be required to settle certain structured note obligations for cash or other securities prior to maturity under certain circumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning purposes. We believe, however, that a portion of such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or redemption date. 

Substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price. For more information on long-term debt funding, including issuances and maturities and redemptions, see Note 11 &#8211; Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation&#8217;s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

We use derivative transactions to manage the duration, interest rate and currency risks of our borrowings, considering the characteristics of the assets they are funding. For more information on our ALM activities, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 44. 

Credit Ratings 

Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by rating agencies on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and other securities, including asset securitizations. Table 16 presents the Corporation&#8217;s current long-term/short-term senior debt ratings and outlooks expressed by the rating agencies. 

The ratings and outlooks from Moody's Investors Service, Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings for the Corporation and its subsidiaries have not changed from those disclosed in the Corporation's 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

During the six months ended June 30, 2024, our net charge-off ratio increased primarily driven by credit card loans and the commercial real estate office portfolio. Commercial reservable criticized exposure increased compared to December 31, 2023 driven by an increase across a broad range of industries excluding commercial real estate, while nonperforming loans remained relatively unchanged. Uncertainty remains regarding 

Bank of America 28 

broader economic impacts as a result of inflationary pressures, elevated rates and the current geopolitical environment and could lead to adverse impacts to credit quality metrics in future periods. 

Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management 

Credit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower&#8217;s credit cycle. Statistical techniques in conjunction with experiential judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio management including underwriting, product pricing, risk appetite, setting credit limits, and establishing operating processes and metrics to quantify and balance risks and returns. Statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external sources, such as credit bureaus, and/or internal historical experience and are a component of our consumer credit risk management process. These models are used in part to assist in making both new and ongoing credit decisions as well as portfolio management strategies, including authorizations and line management, collection practices and strategies, and determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses and allocated capital for credit risk. 

Consumer Credit Portfolio 

During the six months ended June 30, 2024, the U.S. unemployment rate remained relatively stable and home prices continued to rise. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, net charge-offs increased $339 million and $714 million to $1.1 billion and $2.1 billion compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to higher credit card loan charge-offs. 

The consumer allowance for loan and lease losses was $8.5 billion, relatively unchanged from December 31, 2023. For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 40. 

For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, charge-offs and loan modifications for the consumer portfolio, see Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation&#8217;s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 5 &#8211; Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, residential mortgage included $125 million and $156 million of loans on which interest had been curtailed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), and therefore were no longer accruing interest, although principal was still insured, and $86 million and $96 million of loans on which interest was still accruing. 

(2) Outstandings primarily includes auto and specialty lending loans and leases of $53.6 billion and $53.9 billion, U.S. securities-based lending loans of $46.7 billion and $46.0 billion at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and non-U.S. consumer loans of $2.8 billion at both June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

We believe that the presentation of information adjusted to exclude the impact of the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option is more representative of the ongoing operations and credit quality of the business. As a result, in the following tables and discussions of the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios, we exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option and provide information that excludes the impact of the fully-insured loan portfolio in certain credit quality statistics. 

Residential Mortgage 

The residential mortgage portfolio made up the largest percentage of our consumer loan portfolio at 50 percent of consumer loans and leases at June 30, 2024. Approximately 51 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio was in Consumer Banking, 46 percent was in GWIM and the remaining portion was in All Other . 

Outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio decreased $533 million during the six months ended June 30, 2024, as paydowns and payoffs outpaced new originations. 

At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the residential mortgage portfolio included $10.5 billion and $11.0 billion of outstanding fully-insured loans, of which $2.1 billion and $2.2 billion had FHA insurance, with the remainder protected by Fannie Mae long-term standby agreements. 

Table 19 presents certain residential mortgage key credit statistics on both a reported basis and excluding the fully-insured loan portfolio. The following discussion presents the residential mortgage portfolio excluding the fully-insured loan portfolio.

(1) Outstandings, accruing past due, nonperforming loans and percentages of portfolio exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. 

(2) Includes loans that are contractually current that have not yet demonstrated a sustained period of payment performance following a modification. 

Nonperforming outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio remained relatively unchanged during the six months ended June 30, 2024. Of the nonperforming residential mortgage loans at June 30, 2024, $1.3 billion, or 63 percent, were current on contractual payments. Loans accruing past due 30 days or more of $987 million also remained relatively unchanged. 

Of the $217.4 billion in total residential mortgage loans outstanding at June 30, 2024, $63.5 billion, or 29 percent, of loans were originated as interest-only. The outstanding balance of interest-only residential mortgage loans that had entered the amortization period was $3.5 billion, or six percent, at June 30, 2024. Residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period generally experience a higher rate of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status compared to the residential mortgage portfolio as a whole. At June 30, 2024, 

$49 million, or one percent, of outstanding interest-only residential mortgages that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more compared to $987 million, or less than one percent, for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, at June 30, 2024, $197 million, or six percent, of outstanding interest-only residential mortgage loans that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming, of which $75 million were contractually current. Loans that have yet to enter the amortization period in our interest-only residential mortgage portfolio are primarily well-collateralized loans to our wealth management clients and have an interest-only period of three years to 10 years. Substantially all of these loans that have yet to enter the amortization period will not be required to make a fully-amortizing payment until 2026 or later.

Table 20 presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the residential mortgage portfolio. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) made up 15 percent of outstandings at both 

June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana MSA within California represented 14 percent of outstandings at both June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Home Equity 

At June 30, 2024, the home equity portfolio made up six percent of the consumer portfolio and was comprised of home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), home equity loans and reverse mortgages. HELOCs generally have an initial draw period of 10 years, and after the initial draw period ends, the loans generally convert to 15- or 20-year amortizing loans. We no longer originate home equity loans or reverse mortgages. 

At June 30, 2024, 84 percent of the home equity portfolio was in Consumer Banking , 10 percent was in GWIM and the remainder of the portfolio was in All Other. Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased $85 million during the six months ended June 30, 2024 primarily due to paydowns outpacing draws on existing lines and new originations. Of the 

total home equity portfolio at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, $9.7 billion and $10.1 billion, or 38 percent and 39 percent, were in first-lien positions. At June 30, 2024, outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio that were in a second-lien or more junior-lien position and where we also held the first-lien loan totaled $4.4 billion, or 17 percent, of our total home equity portfolio. 

Unused HELOCs totaled $45.3 billion and $45.1 billion at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The HELOC utilization rate was 35 percent at both June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

(1) Outstandings, accruing past due, nonperforming loans and percentages of the portfolio exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. 

(2) Includes loans that are contractually current that have not yet demonstrated a sustained period of payment performance following a modification. 

Nonperforming outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased $28 million to $422 million at June 30, 2024, primarily driven by paydowns and payoffs and returns to performing status outpacing new additions. Of the nonperforming home equity loans at June 30, 2024, $253 million, or 60 percent, were current on contractual payments. In addition, $94 million, or 22 percent, were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell. Accruing loans that were 30 days or more past d ue remained relatively unchanged d uring the six months ended June 30, 2024. 

Of the $25.4 billion in total home equity portfolio outstandings at June 30, 2024, as shown in Table 21, 10 percent require interest-only payments. The outstanding balance of HELOCs that had reached the end of their draw period and 

entered the amortization period was $3.6 billion at June 30, 2024. The HELOCs that have entered the amortization period have experienced a higher percentage of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status when compared to the HELOC portfolio as a whole. At June 30, 2024, $36 million, or one percent, of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more. In addition, at June 30, 2024, $262 million, or seven percent, were nonperforming. 

For our interest-only HELOC portfolio, we do not actively track how many of our home equity customers pay only the minimum amount due on their home equity loans and lines; however, we can infer some of this information through a review of our HELOC portfolio that we service and is still in its revolving period. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, 29 percent 

31 Bank of America 

of these customers with an outstanding balance did not pay any principal on their HELOCs. 

Table 22 presents outstandings, nonperforming balances and net recoveries by certain state concentrations for the home equity portfolio. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 11 percent of the 

outstanding home equity portfolio at both June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana MSA within California made up 10 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Credit Card 

At June 30, 2024, 97 percent of the credit card portfolio was managed in Consumer Banking with the remainder in GWIM . Outstandings in the credit card portfolio decreased $2.8 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2024 to $99.5 billion as payments more than offset purchase volume and card transfers. Net charge-offs increased $345 million to $955 million and $743 million to $1.9 billion during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. 

Credit card loans 30 days or more past due and still accruing interest of $2.4 billion, and 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest of $1.3 billion remained relatively unchanged at June 30, 2024. 

Unused lines of credit for credit card increased to $396.5 billion at June 30, 2024 from $390.2 billion at December 31, 2023.

Direct/Indirect Consumer 

At June 30, 2024, 52 percent of the direct/indirect portfolio was included in Consumer Banking (consumer auto and recreational vehicle lending) and 48 percent was included in 

GWIM (principally securities-based lending loans). Outstandings in the direct/indirect portfolio increased $366 million during the six months ended June 30, 2024 to $103.8 billion driven by increases in securities-based lending.

Other Consumer 

Other consumer primarily consists of deposit overdraft balances. Net charge-offs decreased $40 million to $67 million and $128 million to $141 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily driven by lower overdraft losses from fraud activity. 

Nonperforming Consumer Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity 

Table 25 presents nonperforming consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity for the three and six months 

ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, nonperforming consumer loans of $2.7 billion remained relatively unchanged. 

At June 30, 2024, $460 million, or 17 percent, of nonperforming loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to their estimated property value less costs to sell. In addition, at June 30, 2024, $1.6 billion, or 61 percent, of nonperforming consumer loans were current and classified as nonperforming loans in accordance with applicable policies. 

During the six months ended June 30, 2024, foreclosed properties of $114 million remained relatively unchanged.

Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management 

Commercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal that concentrations of credit exposure continue to be aligned with our risk appetite. We review, measure and manage concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, customer relationship and loan size. We also review, measure and manage commercial real estate loans by geographic location and property type. In addition, within our non-U.S. portfolio, we evaluate exposures by region and by country. Tables 30, 32 and 35 summarize our concentrations. We also utilize syndications of exposure to third parties, loan sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage 

the size and risk profile of the commercial credit portfolio. For more information on our industry concentrations, see Table 32 and Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management &#8211; Industry Concentrations on page 37. 

For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, net charge-offs and loan modifications for the commercial portfolio, see Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation&#8217;s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 5 &#8211; Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Commercial Credit Portfolio 

Outstanding commercial loans and leases increased $6.1 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2024 due to growth in U.S. commercial, primarily in GWIM and Global Markets. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, commercial credit quality deteriorated as reservable criticized utilized exposure increased primarily driven by U.S. commercial across a broad range of industries while commercial nonperforming loans remained relatively unchanged. Commercial net charge-offs increased $325 million and $641 million to $474 million and $944 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to higher losses in the commercial real estate office portfolio. 

With the exception of the office property type, which is further discussed in the Commercial Real Estate section herein, credit quality of commercial real estate borrowers has remained relatively stable since December 31, 2023; however, we are closely monitoring emerging trends and borrower performance in the higher interest rate environment. Recent demand for office space has been stagnant, and future demand for office space continues to be uncertain as companies evaluate space needs with employment models that utilize a mix of remote and conventional office use. 

The commercial allowance for loan and lease losses decreased $98 million during the six months ended June 30, 2024 to $4.7 billion. For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 40. 

Total commercial utilized credit exposure increased $1.5 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2024 to $697.8 billion primarily driven by increased loans and leases, partially offset by lower derivative assets. The utilization rate for loans and leases, standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and financial guarantees, and commercial letters of credit, in the aggregate, was 55 percent at both June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

Table 26 presents commercial credit exposure by type for utilized, unfunded and total binding committed credit exposure. Commercial utilized credit exposure includes SBLCs and financial guarantees and commercial letters of credit that have been issued and for which we are legally bound to advance funds under prescribed conditions during a specified time period, and excludes exposure related to trading account assets. Although funds have not yet been advanced, these exposure types are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes.

Commercial and Industrial 

Commercial and industrial loans include U.S. commercial and non-U.S. commercial portfolios. 

U.S. Commercial 

At June 30, 2024, 62 percent of the U.S. commercial loan portfolio, excluding small business, was managed in Global Banking, 22 percent in Global Markets , 15 percent in GWIM (loans that provide financing for asset purchases, business investments and other liquidity needs for high net worth clients) and the remainder primarily in Consumer Banking . U.S. commercial loans increased $10.2 billion, or three percent, during the six months ended June 30, 2024 primarily driven by Global Banking and GWIM. Reservable criticized utilized exposure increased $1.8 billion, or 15 percent, driven by a broad range of industries. 

Non-U.S. Commercial 

At June 30, 2024, 60 percent of the non-U.S. commercial loan portfolio was managed in Global Banking, 39 percent in Global Markets and the remainder primarily in GWIM. Non-U.S. commercial loans decreased $2.4 billion, or two percent, during the six months ended June 30, 2024 primarily driven by Global Banking . Reservable criticized utilized exposure increased $48 million, or three percent. For information on the non-U.S. commercial portfolio, see Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 39. 

Commercial Real Estate 

Commercial real estate primarily includes commercial loans secured by non-owner-occupied real estate and is dependent on the sale or lease of the real estate as the primary source of repayment. Outstanding loans decreased $2.6 billion, or four percent, during the six months ended June 30, 2024 to $70.3 billion primarily driven by the office property type. The 

commercial real estate portfolio is primarily managed in Global Banking and consists of loans made primarily to public and private developers, and commercial real estate firms. The portfolio remains diversified across property types and geographic regions. California represented the largest state concentration at 20 percent of commercial real estate at both June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

Reservable criticized utilized exposure decreased $435 million, or five percent, during the six months ended June 30, 2024 primarily driven by office loans. Office loans represented the largest property type concentration at 23 percent of the commercial real estate portfolio at June 30, 2024, and approximately two percent of total loans for the Corporation. This property type is roughly 75 percent Class A and had an origination loan-to-value of approximately 55 percent. Reservable criticized exposure for the office property type was $5.1 billion at June 30, 2024, and approximately $4.8 billion of office loans are scheduled to mature by the end of 2024. 

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, net charge-offs increased by $203 million and $485 million to $272 million and $576 million compared to the same periods in 2023 driven by office loans. We use a number of proactive risk mitigation initiatives to reduce adversely rated exposure in the commercial real estate portfolio, including transfers of deteriorating exposures for management by independent special asset officers and the pursuit of loan restructurings or asset sales to achieve the best results for our customers and the Corporation.

U.S. Small Business Commercial 

The U.S. small business commercial loan portfolio is comprised of small business card loans and small business loans primarily managed in Consumer Banking . Credit card-related products were 54 percent of the U.S. small business commercial portfolio at both June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and represented 99 percent and 98 percent of net charge-offs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to 98 percent for the same periods in 2023. Accruing past due 90 days or more of $189 million remained relatively unchanged. 

Nonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity 

Table 31 presents the nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. Nonperforming loans do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, nonperforming commercial loans and leases increased $29 million to $2.8 billion. At June 30, 2024, 94 percent of commercial nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties were secured, and 42 percent were contractually current. Commercial nonperforming loans were carried at 79 percent of their unpaid principal balance, as the carrying value of these loans has been reduced to the estimated collateral value less costs to sell.

Industry Concentrations 

Table 32 presents commercial committed and utilized credit exposure by industry. For information on net notional credit protection purchased to hedge funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management &#8211; Risk Mitigation. 

Commercial credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of industries. Total commercial committed exposure increased $8.0 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2024 to $1.2 trillion. The increase in commercial committed exposure was concentrated in Asset managers and funds, Software and services and Consumer services. 

For information on industry limits, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management &#8211; Risk Mitigation in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Asset managers and funds, our largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $174.3 billion, increased $5.0 billion, or three percent, during the six months ended June 30, 2024, which was primarily driven by investment-grade exposures. 

Real estate, our second largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $97.3 billion decreased $3.0 billion or three percent during the six months ended June 30, 2024. For more information on the commercial real estate and related portfolios, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management &#8211; Commercial Real Estate on page 36. 

Capital goods, our third largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $92.2 billion, decreased $4.8 billion, or five percent, during the six months ended June 30, 2024. The decline in committed exposure was primarily due to decreases in Industrial conglomerates and Aerospace and defense, partially offset by an increase in Building products. 

Various macroeconomic challenges, including geopolitical tensions, inflationary pressures and elevated interest rates, have led to uncertainty in the U.S. and global economies and have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, a number of industries. We continue to monitor all industries, particularly higher risk industries that are experiencing or could experience a more significant impact to their financial condition.

(2) Includes the notional amount of unfunded legally binding lending commitments, net of amounts distributed (i.e., syndicated or participated) to other financial institutions. The distributed amounts were $10.3 billion at both June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

(3) Industries are viewed from a variety of perspectives to best isolate the perceived risks. For purposes of this table, the real estate industry is defined based on the primary business activity of the borrowers or counterparties using operating cash flows and primary source of repayment as key factors. 

Risk Mitigation 

We purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain credit exposures. To lower the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, we may add credit exposure within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection. 

At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, net notional credit default protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, was $10.4 billion and $10.9 billion. We recorded net gains of $9 million and net losses of $16 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to net losses of $34 million and $111 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023. The gains and losses on these instruments were largely offset by gains and losses on the 

related exposures. The Value-at-Risk (VaR) results for these exposures are included in the fair value option portfolio information in Table 38. For more information, see Trading Risk Management on page 42.

Non-U.S. Portfolio 

Our non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios are subject to country risk. We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes in government policies. A risk management framework is in place to measure, monitor and manage non-U.S. risk and exposures. In addition to the direct risk of doing business in a country, we also are exposed to indirect country risks (e.g., related to the collateral received on secured financing transactions or related to client clearing activities). These indirect exposures are managed in the normal course of business through credit, market and operational risk governance rather than through country risk governance. For more information on our non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios, see Non-U.S. Portfolio in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more information on risks related to our non-U.S. portfolio, see the Geopolitical section within Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation&#8217;s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Table 35 presents our 20 largest non-U.S. country exposures at June 30, 2024. These exposures accounted for 89 percent of our total non-U.S. exposure at both June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Net country exposure for these 20 countries increased $10.0 billion in 2024 primarily driven by an increase in the United Kingdom.

Our largest non-U.S. country exposure at June 30, 2024 was the United Kingdom with net exposure of $66.8 billion, which increased $10.9 billion from December 31, 2023 primarily due to increased deposits with the central bank. Our second largest non-U.S. country exposure was Germany with net exposure of $33.6 billion at June 30, 2024, which decreased $2.0 billion from December 31, 2023 primarily due to lower exposure with financial institutions.

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses decreased $209 million from December 31, 2023 to $14.3 billion at June 30, 2024, which included a $33 million and $176 million reserve decrease related to the consumer and commercial portfolios. The reserve 

decrease was primarily driven by the commercial portfolio due to an improved macroeconomic outlook.

Net charge-offs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 were $1.5 billion and $3.0 billion compared to $869 million and $1.7 billion for the same periods in 2023 primarily due to credit card loans and the commercial real estate office portfolio. The provision for credit losses increased $383 million to $1.5 billion and $771 million to $2.8 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. The provision for credit losses for the current-year periods was primarily driven by credit card loans and the commercial real estate office portfolio. The provision for credit losses for the consumer portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, of $1.1 billion and $2.1 billion was largely unchanged for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. The provision for credit 

losses for the commercial portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, increased $255 million to $414 million and $764 million to $774 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023.

Market Risk Management 

For more information on our market risk management process, see Market Risk Management in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more information on market risks, see the Market section within Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation&#8217;s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions may adversely impact the value of assets or liabilities, or otherwise negatively impact earnings. This risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations, primarily within our Global Markets segment. We are also exposed to these risks in other areas of the Corporation (e.g., our ALM activities). In the event of market stress, these risks could have a material impact on our results. 

Trading Risk Management 

To evaluate risks in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of revenues generated by individual positions as well as portfolios of positions. VaR is a common statistic used to measure market risk. Our primary VaR statistic is equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level, which means that for a VaR with a one-day holding period, there should not be losses in excess of VaR, on average, 99 out of 100 trading days. 

Table 38 presents the total market-based portfolio VaR, which is the combination of the total covered positions (and less liquid trading positions) portfolio and the fair value option portfolio. For more information on the market risk VaR for trading activities, see Trading Risk Management in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

The total market-based portfolio VaR results in Table 38 include market risk to which we are exposed from all business segments, excluding credit valuation adjustment (CVA), DVA and related hedges. The majority of this portfolio is within the Global Markets segment. 

Table 38 presents period-end, average, high and low daily trading VaR for the three months ended June 30, 2024, March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2023 using a 99 percent confidence level. The amounts disclosed in Table 38 and Table 39 align to the view of covered positions used in the Basel 3 capital calculations. Foreign exchange and commodity positions are always considered covered positions, regardless of trading or banking treatment for the trade, except for structural foreign currency positions that are excluded with prior regulatory approval. 

The average of total covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio VaR increased for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the prior quarter due to an increase in interest rate and debt risk.

The following graph presents the daily covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio VaR for the previous five quarters, corresponding to the data in Table 38. 

Additional VaR statistics produced within our single VaR model are provided in Table 39 at the same level of detail as in Table 38. Evaluating VaR with additional statistics allows for an increased understanding of the risks in the portfolio, as the historical market data used in the VaR calculation does not necessarily follow a predefined statistical distribution.

Backtesting 

The accuracy of the VaR methodology is evaluated by backtesting, which compares the daily VaR results, utilizing a one-day holding period, against a comparable subset of trading revenue. For more information on our backtesting process, see Trading Risk Management &#8211; Backtesting in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, there were no days where this subset of trading revenue had losses that exceeded our total covered portfolio VaR, utilizing a one-day holding period. 

Total Trading-related Revenue 

Total trading-related revenue, excluding brokerage fees, and CVA, DVA and funding valuation adjustment gains (losses), represents the total amount earned from trading positions, 

including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. For more information, see Trading Risk Management &#8211; Total Trading-related Revenue in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

The following histogram is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 100 percent of the trading days, of which 95 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million. This compares to the three months ended March 31, 2024 where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 100 percent of the trading days, of which 97 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million.

Trading Portfolio Stress Testing 

Because the very nature of a VaR model suggests results can exceed our estimates and it is dependent on a limited historical window, we also stress test our portfolio using scenario analysis. This analysis estimates the change in the value of our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements. For more information, see Trading Risk Management &#8211; Trading Portfolio Stress Testing in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel upward move in interest rates, with the majority of that impact coming from the short end of the yield curve. Additionally, higher interest rates negatively impact the fair value of our debt securities classified as available for sale and adversely affect accumulated OCI and thus capital levels under the Basel 3 capital rules. Under instantaneous upward parallel shifts, the near-term adverse impact to Basel 3 capital would be reduced over time by offsetting positive impacts to net interest income generated from banking book activities. For more information on Basel 3, see Capital Management &#8211; Regulatory Capital on page 21. 

As part of our ALM activities, we use securities, certain residential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity. The sensitivity analysis in Table 41 assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shocks and does not assume any change in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates. Beginning in the second quarter of 2024, the sensitivity analysis incorporates potential movements in customer behavior that could result in changes in both total customer deposit balances and deposit balance mix, (e.g., interest bearing versus noninterest bearing), under the various interest rate scenarios. In higher rate scenarios, the analysis assumes that a portion of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits are replaced with higher yielding deposits or market-based funding. Conversely, in lower rate scenarios, the analysis assumes that a portion of higher yielding deposits or market-based funding are replaced with low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits. 

For larger interest rate scenarios, the interest rate sensitivity may behave in a non-linear manner as there are numerous estimates and assumptions, which require a high degree of judgment and are often interrelated, that could impact the outcome. Pertaining to the mortgage-backed securities and residential mortgage portfolio, if long-end interest rates were to significantly decrease over the next twelve months, for example over 200 bps, there would generally be an increase in customer prepayment behaviors with an incremental reduction to net interest income, noting that the extent of changes in customer prepayment activity can be impacted by multiple factors and is not necessarily limited to long-end interest rates. Conversely, if long-end interest rates were to significantly increase over the next twelve months, for example, over 200 bps, customer prepayments would likely modestly decrease and result in an incremental increase to net interest income. In addition, deposit pricing is rate sensitive in nature. This sensitivity is assumed to have non-linear impacts to larger short-end rate movements. In decreasing interest rate scenarios, and particularly where interest rates have decreased to small amounts, the ability to further reduce rates paid is reduced as customer rates near zero. In higher short-end rate scenarios, deposit pricing will likely increase at a faster rate, leading to incremental interest expense and reducing asset sensitivity. While the impact related to the above assumptions used in the asset sensitivity analysis can provide directional analysis on how net interest income will be impacted in changing environments, the ultimate impact is dependent upon the interrelationship of the assumptions and factors, which vary in different macroeconomic scenarios. 

Economic Value of Equity 

In addition to interest rate sensitivity described above, the Corporation&#8217;s management of its interest rate exposures in the banking book also considers a long-term view of interest rate sensitivity through the measurement of Economic Value of Equity (EVE). EVE captures changes in the net present value of banking book assets and liabilities under various interest rate scenarios and its impact to Tier 1 capital. Similar to net interest income, the Corporation establishes limits for EVE. EVE is largely driven by the Corporation&#8217;s longer duration fixed-rate products, such as investment securities, residential mortgages and deposits. For assets or liabilities that have no stated maturity, such as deposits, the Corporation estimates the duration for measurement purposes. 

Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative Contracts 

We use interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts in our ALM activities to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Specifically, we use those derivatives to manage both the variability in cash flows and changes in fair value of various assets and liabilities arising from those risks. Our interest rate derivative contracts are generally non-leveraged swaps tied to various benchmark interest rates and foreign exchange basis swaps, options, futures and forwards, and our foreign exchange contracts include cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign currency futures contracts, foreign currency forward contracts and options. 

The derivatives used in our ALM activities can be split into two broad categories: designated accounting hedges and other risk management derivatives. Designated accounting hedges are primarily used to manage our exposure to interest rates as described in the Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book section and are included in the sensitivities presented in Table 41. The Corporation also uses foreign currency derivatives in accounting hedges to manage substantially all of the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations. By hedging the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations, the Corporation's market risk exposure in this area is not significant. 

Risk management derivatives are predominantly used to hedge foreign exchange risks related to various foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities and eliminate substantially all foreign currency exposures in the cash flows of the Corporation&#8217;s non-trading foreign currency-denominated financial instruments. These foreign exchange derivatives are sensitive to other market risk exposures such as cross-currency basis spreads and interest rate risk. However, as these features are not a significant component of these foreign exchange derivatives, the market risk related to this exposure is not significant. For more information on the accounting for derivatives, see Note 3 &#8211; Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Mortgage Banking Risk Management 

We originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. We determine whether loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate. 

Changes in interest rates impact the value of interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and the related residential first mortgage loans held-for-sale (LHFS), as well as the value of the MSRs. Because the interest rate risks of these hedged items offset, we combine them into one overall hedged item with one combined economic hedge portfolio consisting of derivative contracts and securities. For more information on IRLCs and the related residential mortgage LHFS, see Mortgage Banking Risk Management in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

There were no significant gains or losses related to the change in fair value of MSRs, IRLCs and LHFS, net of gains and losses on the hedge portfolio, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. For more information on MSRs, see Note 14 &#8211; Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Climate Risk 

Climate Risk Management 

Climate risk is the risk that climate change or actions taken to mitigate climate change expose the Corporation to economic, legal/regulatory, operational or reputational harm. Climate-related risks are divided into two major categories, both of which span across the seven key risk types discussed in the Managing Risk section in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K: (1) Physical Risk: risks related to the physical impacts of climate change, driven by extreme weather events such as hurricanes and floods, as well as chronic longer-term shifts such as rising average global temperatures and sea levels, and (2) Transition Risk: risks related to the transition to a low-carbon economy, which may entail extensive policy, legal, technology and market changes. 

Physical risks of climate change, such as more frequent and severe extreme weather events, can increase the Corporation&#8217;s risks, including credit risk by diminishing borrowers&#8217; repayment capacity or collateral values, and operational risk by negatively impacting the Corporation&#8217;s facilities, employees, or vendors. Transition risks of climate change may amplify credit risks through the financial impacts of changes in policy, technology or the market on the Corporation or our counterparties. Unanticipated market changes can lead to sudden price adjustments and give rise to heightened market risk. 

Reputational risk can arise if we do not meet our climate-related goals and/or targets, or are perceived to be inadequately responsive to climate change or otherwise. 

Our approach to managing climate risk is consistent with our risk management governance structure, from senior management to our Board and its committees, including the Enterprise Risk Committee (ERC) and the Corporate Governance, ESG and Sustainability Committee (CGESC) of the Board, which regularly discuss climate-related topics. The ERC oversees climate risk as set forth in our Risk Framework and Risk Appetite Statement. The CGESC is responsible for overseeing the Corporation&#8217;s environmental and sustainability-related activities and practices, and regularly reviews the Corporation&#8217;s climate-related policies and practices. Our Climate Risk Council consists of leaders across risk, Front Line Unit and control functions, and meets routinely to discuss our approach to managing climate-related risks. 

Our climate risk management efforts are overseen by an officer who reports to the Chief Risk Officer. The Corporation has a Climate and Environmental Risk Management function that is responsible for overseeing climate risk management. They are responsible for establishing the Climate Risk Framework (described below) and governance structure, and providing an independent assessment of enterprise-wide climate risks. 

Based on the Corporation&#8217;s Risk Framework, in 2023 we created our internal Climate Risk Framework, which addresses how the Corporation identifies, measures, monitors and controls climate risk by enhancing existing risk management processes and also includes examples of how climate risk manifests across the seven risk types. The framework details the roles and responsibilities for climate risk management across our three lines of defense (i.e., Front Line Units, Global Risk Management and Corporate Audit). 

For more information on our governance framework, see the Managing Risk section in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more information on climate risk, see Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation&#8217;s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Climate-related Goals and Targets 

In 2021, the Corporation announced a goal of achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions before 2050 in our financing activities, operations and supply chain (Net Zero goal). As part of this goal, we have set interim 2030 targets across our financing activities related to certain high-emitting sectors (2030 Financing Activity Emissions Targets), operations and supply chain, all of which are further supported and complemented by our 10-year goal to mobilize and deploy $1.5 trillion in sustainable finance by 2030 in support of the U.N. 

Bank of America 46 

Sustainable Development Goals, of which $1 trillion is dedicated to supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy, including capital mobilized across clean energy sectors and tailored financial solutions for emerging areas of the low-carbon economy. In particular, we have announced 2030 Financing Activity Emissions Targets for auto manufacturing, aviation, cement, energy, iron and steel, maritime shipping and power generation sectors. 

Achieving our climate--related goals and targets, including our Net Zero goal and 2030 Financing Activity Emissions Targets, may require technological advances, clearly defined roadmaps for industry sectors and better emissions data reporting. Required changes may also include new standards and public policies, including those that improve the cost of capital for the transition to a low-carbon economy, as well as strong and active engagement with customers, suppliers, investors, government officials and other stakeholders. Activities related to our climate-related goals and targets have not resulted in a significant effect on our results of operations or financial position in the relevant periods presented herein. 

For more information on climate-related matters and the Corporation&#8217;s climate-related goals and targets, including the Corporation&#8217;s plans to achieve its Net Zero goal and its 2030 targets, and progress on its sustainable finance goal, see the Corporation&#8217;s website, including its 2023 Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Report (2023 TCFD Report) and Addendum to the 2023 TCFD Report (2023 TCFD Addendum). The contents of the Corporation&#8217;s website, including the 2023 TCFD Report and 2023 TCFD Addendum are not incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

The foregoing discussion and the statements on the Corporation&#8217;s website, including in the 2023 TCFD Report and 2023 TCFD Addendum, regarding the Corporation&#8217;s climate-related goals and targets, its approach with respect to climate risk management, and the nature and extent of climate-related risks, contain &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are not guarantees of future results or performance and involve certain known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and are often beyond the Corporation&#8217;s control. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, any of these forward-looking statements. 

Complex Accounting Estimates 

Our significant accounting principles, are essential in understanding the MD&#38;A. Many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. We have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments. For more information, see Complex Accounting Estimates in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation&#8217;s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Goodwill and Intangible Assets 

The nature of and accounting for goodwill and intangible assets are discussed in Note 7 &#8211; Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein and Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation&#8217;s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of June 30, 2024, goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet was as follows. 

Table 42 Goodwill by Reporting Segment (Dollars in millions) June 30 2024 December 31 2023 Consumer Banking $ 30,137 &#160; $ 30,137 Global Wealth and Investment Management 9,677 &#160; 9,677 Global Banking 24,026 &#160; 24,026 Global Markets 5,181 &#160; 5,181 Total $ 69,021 &#160; $ 69,021 

We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of June 30, 2024 by using a qualitative assessment. Factors considered in the qualitative assessment include, among others, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, financial performance of the respective reporting unit and other relevant entity and reporting-unit specific considerations. Based on our assessment, we have concluded that none of our reporting units are at risk of impairment, as each of the reporting units&#8217; fair values are substantially in excess of their carrying values.
