 Item 2. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Bank of America Corporation (the &#8220;Corporation&#8221;) and its management may make certain statements that constitute &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;targets,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;hopes,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221; &#8220;intends,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;goals,&#8221; &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;continue&#8221; and other similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;might,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;would&#8221; and &#8220;could.&#8221; Forward-looking statements represent the Corporation&#8217;s current expectations, plans or forecasts of its future results, revenues, provision for credit losses, expenses, efficiency ratio, capital measures, strategy, and future business and economic conditions more generally, and other future matters. These statements are not guarantees of future results or performance and involve certain known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and are often beyond the Corporation&#8217;s control. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, any of these forward-looking statements.

Recent Developments 

Monoline Insurance Litigation Settlement 

As previously disclosed, on October 6, 2022, the Corporation and certain wholly owned subsidiaries entered into an agreement with Ambac Assurance Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, &#8220;Ambac&#8221;) to resolve all pending Ambac lawsuits against the Corporation and its subsidiaries previously disclosed in the Corporation&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in prior SEC reports. Under the terms of the agreement, in exchange for the Corporation&#8217;s payment of $1.84 billion, Ambac, among other things, caused all pending litigation between the parties to be dismissed with prejudice, and released the Corporation and its subsidiaries from all outstanding claims related to Ambac&#8217;s issuance of bond insurance policies for certain of the Corporation&#8217;s and legacy entities&#8217; securitized pools of residential mortgage loans. The Corporation recorded litigation expense of $354 million in the third quarter of 2022 for the portion of the settlement in excess of previously accrued amounts. For more information, see Note 10 &#8211; Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Changes in U.S. Tax Law 

On August 16, 2022, the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which contained a number of tax-related provisions. The tax changes included the extension and expansion of renewable energy tax credit programs, the establishment of a new 15 percent alternative minimum tax on adjusted financial statement income for large corporations and a one percent excise tax on stock repurchases. For more information, see Financial Highlights &#8211; Income Tax Expense on page 7. 

Capital Management 

In June 2022, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) announced the results of the 2022 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) supervisory stress tests, which included preliminary stress capital buffers (SCBs) that were finalized in August 2022. Based on the results, our SCB increased to 3.4 percent from 2.5 percent, resulting in a minimum Common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio requirement of 10.4 percent under the Standardized approach, effective October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023. 

On October 19, 2022, the Corporation&#8217;s Board of Directors (the Board) declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.22 per share, payable on December 30, 2022 to shareholders of record as of December 2, 2022. 

For more information on our capital resources, see Capital Management on page 23. 

Russia/Ukraine Conflict 

As previously disclosed, due to the Russia/Ukraine conflict, there has been significant volatility in financial and commodities markets, and multiple jurisdictions have implemented various economic sanctions. At September 30, 2022, June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, our direct net country exposure to Russia was $461 million, $550 million and $733 million, 

3 Bank of America 

primarily consisting of outstanding loans and leases totaling $390 million, $468 million and $686 million, respectively, and our net country exposure to Ukraine was not significant. While the Corporation&#8217;s direct exposure to Russia is limited, the potential duration, course and impact of the Russia/Ukraine conflict remain uncertain and could adversely affect macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, which could negatively impact the Corporation's businesses, results of operations and financial position. For more information on the Russia/Ukraine conflict, including related risks, see Recent Developments &#8211; Russia/Ukraine in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended June 30, 2022 and March 31, 2022, and the Market and Geopolitical sections within Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rates 

Immediately after December 31, 2021, ICE Benchmark Administration ceased publishing British Pound Sterling (GBP), Euro, Swiss Franc, and Japanese Yen (JPY) London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) settings and one-week and two-month U.S. dollar (USD) LIBOR settings. However, certain GBP and JPY LIBOR settings that became no longer representative of the underlying market that such rates sought to measure are being published using a modified calculation (i.e., on a &#8220;synthetic&#8221; basis). The remaining USD LIBOR settings (i.e., overnight, one month, three month, six month and 12 month) will cease or become non-representative immediately after June 30, 2023. 

The Corporation continues to execute its enterprise-wide transition program with respect to LIBOR and other impacted benchmark rates. The Corporation has ceased entering into new contracts that use USD LIBOR as a reference rate, subject to limited exceptions, including those consistent with supervisory guidance issued by the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance 

Corporation (FDIC). The Corporation also continues to monitor a variety of market scenarios as part of its transition efforts, including risks associated with insufficient preparation by individual market participants or the overall market ecosystem, ability of market participants to transition away from impacted benchmarks, and access and demand by clients and market participants to liquidity in certain products, including LIBOR products. 

As previously disclosed, the Corporation has remediated a significant majority of its notional contractual exposure to LIBOR products referencing USD LIBOR settings that will cease or become non-representative immediately after June 30, 2023 (i.e., updated to include fallback provisions to alternative reference rates (ARRs), such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate for USD LIBOR, that are based on market-driven protocols, regulatory guidance, and industry-recommended fallback provisions and related mechanisms). The remaining non-remediated USD LIBOR exposure, a majority of which is made up of derivatives and commercial loans, represents a small minority of outstanding USD LIBOR notional contractual exposure of the Corporation and requires active dialogue with clients to modify such contracts. For any residual exposures after June 2023 that continue to have no fallback provisions, the Corporation is assessing and planning to leverage relevant contractual and statutory solutions, including the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act, enacted in March 2022 at the federal level in the U.S. and subject to the issuance of final implementing rules by the Federal Reserve, and other relevant legislation, to transition such exposure to ARRs. 

For more information on the expected replacement of LIBOR and other benchmark rates, see Executive Summary &#8211; Recent Developments &#8211; LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rates in the MD&#38;A and Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8211; Other of the Corporation&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Net income was $7.1 billion and $20.4 billion, or $0.81 and $2.34 per diluted share, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $7.7 billion and $25.0 billion, or $0.85 and $2.75 per diluted share, for the same periods in 2021. The decrease in net income was primarily due to an increase in provision for credit losses, lower noninterest income and higher noninterest expense, partially offset by higher net interest income. In addition, the nine-month period in the prior year included a positive income tax adjustment related to the revaluation of U.K. net deferred tax assets. 

Total assets decreased $96.5 billion from December 31, 2021 to $3.1 trillion primarily driven by lower cash and cash equivalents due to deposit outflows related to the rising interest rate environment and lower debt securities, partially offset by loan growth across commercial and consumer products, as well as higher trading account assets and derivative assets to support Global Markets activity. 

Total liabilities decreased $96.0 billion from December 31, 2021 to $2.8 trillion primarily driven by deposit outflows related to the rising interest rate environment and customer tax payments. 

Shareholders&#8217; equity decreased $542 million from December 31, 2021 primarily due to market value decreases on derivatives and debt securities, as well as returns of capital to 

shareholders through common and preferred stock dividends and common stock repurchases, partially offset by net income and the issuance of preferred stock. 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income increased $2.7 billion to $13.8 billion, and $6.3 billion to $37.8 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. Net interest yield on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis increased 38 basis points (bps) to 2.06 percent, and 21 bps to 1.87 percent for the same periods. The increase in net interest income for the three-month period was primarily driven by benefits from higher interest rates, including lower premium amortization expense, and loan growth, partially offset by lower deposits and securities. The increase in the nine-month period was primarily driven by lower premium amortization expense, loan growth and higher interest rates, partially offset by a decrease in the acceleration of net capitalized loan fees due to Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan forgiveness. For more information on net interest yield and the FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 8, and for more information on interest rate risk management, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 45.

Noninterest Income

Noninterest income decreased $935 million to $10.7 billion and decreased $2.9 billion to $32.6 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. The following highlights the significant changes. 

&#9679; Service charges decreased $462 million and $578 million primarily driven by the impact of non-sufficient funds and overdraft policy changes as well as lower treasury service charges. 

&#9679; Investment and brokerage services decreased $441 million and $244 million primarily driven by lower market valuations. 

&#9679; Investment banking fees decreased $1.0 billion and $2.8 billion primarily driven by a decline in demand resulting in lower equity and debt issuance fees and lower advisory fees. 

&#9679; Market making and similar activities increased $1.1 billion and $1.7 billion primarily driven by improved performance across macro products in fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) and derivative products in Equities. 

&#9679; Other income decreased $84 million and $876 million primarily due to certain valuation adjustments. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses increased $1.5 billion to $898 million and $5.6 billion to $1.5 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. The provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily driven by loan growth and a dampening macroeconomic outlook, and the nine-month period was driven by the same factors as well as a reserve build related to Russian exposure, partially offset by asset quality improvement and reduced COVID-19 pandemic (the pandemic) uncertainties. For the same periods in the prior year, the benefit in the provision for credit losses was due to an improved macroeconomic outlook. For more information on the provision for credit losses, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 42.

Noninterest Expense 

Table 3 Noninterest Expense Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Compensation and benefits $ 8,887 &#160; $ 8,714 $ 27,286 &#160; $ 27,103 Occupancy and equipment 1,777 &#160; 1,764 5,285 &#160; 5,353 Information processing and communications 1,546 &#160; 1,416 4,621 &#160; 4,289 Product delivery and transaction related 892 &#160; 987 2,749 &#160; 2,940 Marketing 505 &#160; 347 1,365 &#160; 1,528 Professional fees 525 &#160; 434 1,493 &#160; 1,263 Other general operating 1,171 &#160; 778 3,096 &#160; 2,524 Total noninterest expense $ 15,303 &#160; $ 14,440 $ 45,895 &#160; $ 45,000 

Noninterest expense increased $863 million to $15.3 billion and $895 million to $45.9 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. The increase in the three-month period was primarily due to higher investments in people and technology and the settlement of the legacy monoline insurance litigation, partially 

offset by lower net COVID-19 related costs. The increase in the nine-month period was primarily due to the same factors as described in the three-month period, as well as expenses recognized for certain regulatory matters during the second quarter of 2022. 

Income Tax Expense 

Table 4 Income Tax Expense Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 (Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 Income before income taxes $ 8,301 &#160; $ 8,950 $ 23,072 &#160; $ 26,158 Income tax expense 1,219 &#160; 1,259 2,676 &#160; 1,193 Effective tax rate 14.7 &#160; % 14.1 % 11.6 &#160; % 4.6 % 

Changes in the effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same periods a year ago were primarily driven by changes in our recurring preference benefits. Also included in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was the impact of the 2021 U.K. tax law change further discussed in this section. The majority of our recurring tax preference benefits consists of tax credits from ESG investments in affordable housing, where the recurring tax credits are recognized ratably over a term of up to 10 years, and wind and solar energy investments, where the tax credits are recognized either at inception for transactions electing Investment Tax Credits (ITCs) or as energy is produced if electing Production Tax Credits (PTCs), as further discussed below. Absent ESG tax credits and unusual items, the effective tax rates would have been approximately 25 percent. 

On August 16, 2022, the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which contained a number of tax-related provisions, including the extension and expansion of renewable energy tax credit programs. In particular, partnerships are no longer limited to an ITC, but can now elect a PTC for solar energy production facilities placed in service after December 31, 2021. As a result, the Corporation changed its estimated impact of solar-related tax credits and reversed the impact of certain solar investment tax credits recognized in the first half of 

2022, which increased income tax expense by $152 million in the third quarter of 2022. If there is a change in the expected tax credit election, an income tax adjustment will be recognized in the quarter in which the change occurs. 

Other notable tax law changes include the establishment of a new 15 percent alternative minimum tax (AMT) on adjusted financial statement income for large corporations and a one percent excise tax on net stock repurchases, both of which are effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2023. The tax law changes for the new AMT permit business credits, including those from ESG investments in renewable energy and affordable housing, to offset potential AMT liability. The Corporation has assessed the potential impacts of these two U.S. tax law changes and does not expect the changes will have a significant effect on its future effective tax rate. 

On June 10, 2021, the U.K. enacted the 2021 Finance Act, which increased the U.K. corporation income tax rate to 25 percent from 19 percent. This change is effective April 1, 2023 and unfavorably affects income tax expense on future U.K. earnings. As a result, during the three months ended June 30, 2021, the Corporation recorded a positive income tax adjustment of approximately $2.0 billion with a corresponding write-up of U.K. net deferred tax assets, which reflected a reversal of previously recorded write-downs of net deferred tax assets for prior changes in the U.K. corporation income tax rate.

Supplemental Financial Data 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

In this Form 10-Q, we present certain non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items or otherwise include components that differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are provided as additional useful information to assess our financial condition, results of operations (including period-to-period operating performance) or compliance with prospective regulatory requirements. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may not be defined or calculated the same way as non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. 

We view net interest income and related ratios and analyses on an FTE basis, which when presented on a consolidated basis are non-GAAP financial measures. To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 21 percent and a representative state tax rate. Net interest yield, which measures the basis points we earn over the cost of funds, utilizes net interest income on an FTE basis. We believe that presentation of these items on an FTE basis allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practices. 

We may present certain key performance indicators and ratios excluding certain items (e.g., debit valuation adjustment (DVA) gains (losses)), which result in non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that the presentation of measures that exclude these items is useful because such measures provide additional information to assess the underlying operational performance and trends of our businesses and to allow better comparison of period-to-period operating performance. 

We also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible equity represents shareholders&#8217; equity or common shareholders&#8217; equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)), net of related deferred tax liabilities (&#8220;adjusted&#8221; shareholders&#8217; equity or common shareholders&#8217; equity). These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models use both return on average tangible 

common shareholders&#8217; equity and return on average tangible shareholders&#8217; equity as key measures to support our overall growth objectives. These ratios are: 

&#9679; Return on average tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity measures our net income applicable to common shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average common shareholders&#8217; equity. The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders&#8217; equity divided by total tangible assets. 

&#9679; Return on average tangible shareholders&#8217; equity measures our net income as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders&#8217; equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders&#8217; equity divided by total tangible assets. 

&#9679; Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders&#8217; equity divided by ending common shares outstanding. 

We believe ratios utilizing tangible equity provide additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. Tangible book value per common share provides additional useful information about the level of tangible assets in relation to outstanding shares of common stock. 

The aforementioned supplemental data and performance measures are presented in Table 5 on page 9. 

For more information on the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 48. 

Key Performance Indicators 

We present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance indicators (key performance indicators) that management uses when assessing our consolidated and/or segment results. We believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information about our underlying operational performance and trends. These key performance indicators (KPIs) may not be defined or calculated in the same way as similar KPIs used by other companies. For information on how these metrics are defined, see Key Metrics on page 101. 

Our consolidated key performance indicators, which include various equity and credit metrics, are presented in Table 1 on page 5 and Table 5 on page 9. 

For information on key segment performance metrics, see Business Segment Operations on page 12.

Business Segment Operations 

Segment Description and Basis of Presentation 

We report our results of operations through four business segments: Consumer Banking, GWIM, Global Banking and Global Markets , with the remaining operations recorded in All Other . We manage our segments and report their results on an FTE basis. For more information, see Business Segment Operations in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

We periodically review capital allocated to our businesses and allocate capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes. We utilize a methodology that considers the effect of regulatory capital requirements in addition to internal risk-based capital models. Our internal risk-based capital models use a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segment&#8217;s credit, market, interest rate, business and operational risk components. For more information on the nature of these risks, see Managing Risk on page 22. The capital allocated to the business segments is referred to as 

allocated capital. Allocated equity in the reporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital for the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the reporting unit. For more information, including the definition of a reporting unit, see Note 7 &#8211; Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

For more information on our presentation of financial information on an FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 8, and for reconciliations to consolidated total revenue, net income and period-end total assets, see Note 17 &#8211; Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Key Performance Indicators 

We present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance indicators that management uses when evaluating segment results. We believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information about our segments&#8217; operational performance, customer trends and business growth.

Consumer Banking, comprised of Deposits and Consumer Lending, offers a diversified range of credit, banking and investment products and services to consumers and small businesses. For more information about Consumer Banking , see Business Segment Operations in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Consumer Banking Results 

Three-Month Comparison 

Net income for Consumer Banking increased $27 million to $3.1 billion due to higher revenue, largely offset by higher noninterest expense and an increase in provision for credit losses. Net interest income increased $1.3 billion to $7.8 billion primarily due to higher interest rates and the benefits of higher deposit and loan balances, partially offset by a decrease in the acceleration of net capitalized loan fees due to PPP loan forgiveness. Noninterest income decreased $225 million to $2.1 billion primarily driven by the impact of non-sufficient funds and overdraft policy changes. 

The provision for credit losses increased $491 million to $738 million primarily driven by loan growth in the current-year period compared to the prior-year period that benefited from an improved macroeconomic outlook. Noninterest expense increased $539 million to $5.1 billion primarily driven by continued investments for business growth, including marketing, technology and compensation and benefits expenses, as well as increased client activity. 

The return on average allocated capital was 30 percent, down from 31 percent, primarily driven by an increase in allocated capital. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 12. 

Nine-Month Comparison 

Net income for Consumer Banking increased $172 million to $8.9 billion due to higher revenue, partially offset by an increase in provision for credit losses and higher noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $3.2 billion to $21.6 billion primarily due to the same factors as described in the three-month discussion. Noninterest income decreased $405 million to $6.3 billion primarily driven by the impact of non-sufficient funds and overdraft policy changes and lower mortgage banking income, partially offset by higher other service charges and card income due to increased client activity. 

The provision for credit losses increased $2.1 billion to $1.0 billion primarily driven by loan growth and a dampening macroeconomic outlook in the current-year period compared to a benefit in the prior-year period due to an improved macroeconomic outlook. Noninterest expense increased $429 million to $15.0 billion primarily driven by continued investments for business growth and increased client activity, partially offset by an impairment charge for real estate rationalization and the contribution to the Bank of America Foundation in the prior-year period. 

The return on average allocated capital was 30 percent, unchanged from the prior-year period.

GWIM consists of two primary businesses: Merrill Wealth Management and Bank of America Private Bank. For more information about GWIM , see Business Segment Operations in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Three-Month Comparison 

Net income for GWIM of $1.2 billion remained relatively unchanged. The operating margin was 29 percent compared to 31 percent a year ago. 

Net interest income increased $529 million to $2.0 billion driven by the benefits of higher interest rates and higher loan balances.

The provision for credit losses increased $95 million to $37 million primarily due to loan growth and a dampening macroeconomic outlook in the current-year period. Noninterest expense increased $72 million to $3.8 billion primarily driven by continued investments in the business, partially offset by lower revenue-related incentives. 

The return on average allocated capital was 27 percent, down from 30 percent, due to an increase in allocated capital and lower net income. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 12.

Except as otherwise noted below, the following explanations for current period-over-period changes for Global Markets , including those disclosed under Sales and Trading Revenue, are the same for amounts including and excluding net DVA. Amounts excluding net DVA are a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information on net DVA, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 8. 

Three-Month Comparison 

Net income for Global Markets increased $139 million to $1.1 billion. Net DVA losses were $14 million compared to losses of $20 million in the prior-year period. Excluding net DVA, net income increased $135 million to $1.1 billion. These increases were primarily driven by lower noninterest expense. 

Revenue decreased $36 million to $4.5 billion primarily driven by lower investment banking fees, largely offset by higher sales and trading revenue. Sales and trading revenue increased $478 million, and excluding net DVA, increased $472 million. These increases were driven by higher revenue in FICC. 

Noninterest expense decreased $229 million to $3.0 billion primarily driven by the realignment of a liquidating business activity from Global Markets to All Other in the fourth quarter of 2021. 

Average total assets increased $43.0 billion to $847.9 billion driven by loan growth, higher derivative balances due to a strong U.S. dollar and higher interest rates, as well as growth in commodities activity. 

The return on average allocated capital was 10 percent, unchanged from the prior-year period, reflecting higher net income offset by an increase in allocated capital. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 12. 

Nine-Month Comparison 

Net income for Global Markets decreased $210 million to $3.7 billion. Net DVA gains were $213 million compared to losses of $56 million in the prior-year period. Excluding net DVA, net income decreased $415 million to $3.5 billion. These decreases were primarily driven by lower revenue, partially offset by lower noninterest expense. 

Revenue decreased $1.2 billion to $14.3 billion primarily due to the same factors as described in the three-month discussion. Sales and trading revenue increased $711 million and excluding net DVA, sales and trading revenue increased $442 million. These increases were driven by higher revenue in both FICC and Equities. 

Noninterest expense decreased $901 million to $9.2 billion primarily due to the same factor as described in the three-month discussion and an acceleration of expenses from incentive compensation award changes in the prior-year period. 

Average total assets increased $82.2 billion to $857.7 billion driven by loan growth and commodities activity in FICC as well as higher balances in Equities. Period-end total assets increased $101.0 billion from December 31, 2021 to $848.8 billion driven by higher derivative balances due to a strong U.S. dollar and higher interest rates, higher levels of inventory in FICC to facilitate client activity, and increased hedging of client activity with stock positions relative to derivatives in Equities. 

The return on average allocated capital was 12 percent, down from 14 percent, reflecting lower net income and an increase in allocated capital.

21 Bank of America 

Three-Month Comparison 

FICC revenue increased $542 million driven by improved performance across macro products, partially offset by a weaker trading performance in credit and mortgage products. Equities revenue decreased $70 million driven by lower client activity in Asia and a weaker trading performance in cash, partially offset by increased client activity in derivatives. 

Nine-Month Comparison 

FICC revenue increased $314 million driven by improved trading performance across interest rate and currency products, partially offset by gains in commodities in the prior-year period for a weather-related event and a weaker trading environment for credit products in the current-year period. Equities revenue increased $128 million driven by a strong trading performance in derivatives, partially offset by a weaker trading performance in cash.

All Other primarily consists of asset and liability management (ALM) activities, liquidating businesses and certain expenses not otherwise allocated to a business segment. ALM activities encompass interest rate and foreign currency risk management activities for which substantially all of the results are allocated to our business segments. For more information on our ALM activities, see Note 17 &#8211; Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Three-Month Comparison 

The net loss of All Other increased $226 million to a loss of $281 million primarily due to higher noninterest expense and a lower income tax benefit, partially offset by higher revenue. 

Revenue increased $246 million primarily driven by lower valuation adjustments. 

Noninterest expense increased $364 million primarily driven by higher litigation expense due to the legacy monoline insurance litigation settlement and the realignment of a liquidating business activity from Global Markets to All Other in the fourth quarter of 2021, partially offset by decreases in other expenses. 

The income tax benefit decreased $118 million primarily due to the impact of lower levels of income tax credits associated with ESG investment activities, which were impacted by enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 in the third quarter of 2022. For more information, see Financial Highlights &#8211; Income Tax Expense on page 7. Both periods included 

income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking . 

Nine-Month Comparison 

Net income decreased $3.0 billion to a loss of $963 million primarily due to a lower income tax benefit and higher noninterest expense. 

Noninterest expense increased $868 million primarily due to the same factors as described in the three-month discussion and expenses recognized for certain regulatory matters during the second quarter of 2022. 

The income tax benefit decreased $2.1 billion primarily due to the impact of the 2021 U.K. tax law change. For more information, see Financial Highlights &#8211; Income Tax Expense on page 7. Both periods included income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking . 

Managing Risk 

Risk is inherent in all our business activities. The seven key types of risk faced by the Corporation are strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational. Sound risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver for our shareholders. If not managed well, risk can result in financial loss, regulatory sanctions and penalties, and damage to our reputation, each of which may adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategies. We take a comprehensive approach to risk management with a defined 

Bank of America 22 

Risk Framework and an articulated Risk Appetite Statement, which are approved annually by the Enterprise Risk Committee and the Board. 

Our Risk Framework serves as the foundation for the consistent and effective management of risks facing the Corporation. The Risk Framework sets forth roles and responsibilities for the management of risk and provides a blueprint for how the Board, through delegation of authority to committees and executive officers, establishes risk appetite and associated limits for our activities. 

Our risk appetite provides a common set of measures for senior management and the Board to clearly indicate the level of risk we are willing to take in alignment with our strategic and capital plans and ensure that the Corporation&#8217;s risk profile remains aligned with our risk appetite. Our risk appetite is formally articulated in the Risk Appetite Statement, which includes both qualitative components and quantitative limits that are reviewed and approved by the Board at least annually. 

For more information about the Corporation&#8217;s risks, including those related to the pandemic, see Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risks are being managed within our Risk Framework and supporting risk management programs. 

For more information on our Risk Framework, our risk management activities and the key types of risk faced by the Corporation, see the Managing Risk section in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Capital Management 

The Corporation manages its capital position so that its capital is more than adequate to support its business activities and aligns with risk, risk appetite and strategic planning. For more information, including related regulatory requirements, see Capital Management in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

CCAR and Capital Planning 

The Federal Reserve requires BHCs to submit a capital plan and planned capital actions on an annual basis, consistent with the rules governing the CCAR capital plan. Based on the results of our 2022 CCAR stress test, our SCB increased to 3.4 percent from 2.5 percent, effective October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023. 

In October 2021, the Board renewed the Corporation&#8217;s $25 billion common stock repurchase program previously announced in April 2021. The Board&#8217;s authorization replaced the previous program. As with the April 2021 authorization, the Board also authorized common stock repurchases to offset shares awarded under the Corporation&#8217;s equity-based compensation plans. Pursuant to the Board&#8217;s authorizations, during the third quarter of 2022, we repurchased $450 million of common stock, predominantly offsetting shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans. 

The timing and amount of common stock repurchases are subject to various factors, including the Corporation&#8217;s capital position, liquidity, financial performance and alternative uses of capital, stock trading price, regulatory requirements and general market conditions, and may be suspended at any time. Such repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including repurchase plans that satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). 

Regulatory Capital 

As a financial services holding company, we are subject to regulatory capital rules, including Basel 3, issued by U.S. banking regulators. The Corporation's depository institution subsidiaries are also subject to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework. The Corporation and its primary affiliated banking entity, BANA, are Advanced approaches institutions under Basel 3 and are required to report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and risk-weighted assets (RWA) under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is used to assess capital adequacy, including under the PCA framework. As of September 30, 2022, the CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios for the Corporation were lower under the Standardized approach. 

Minimum Capital Requirements 

In order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments, the Corporation must meet risk-based capital ratio requirements that include a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent (under the Advanced approaches only), an SCB (under the Standardized approach only), plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer and a global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge. The buffers and surcharge must be comprised solely of CET1 capital. For the period from October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022, the Corporation's minimum CET1 capital ratio requirement was 9.5 percent under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. Based on the results of our 2022 CCAR stress test, the Corporation&#8217;s SCB increased to 3.4 percent, resulting in a minimum CET1 capital ratio requirement of 10.4 percent under the Standardized approach for the period from October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023. At September 30, 2022, the Corporation&#8217;s CET1 capital ratio of 11.0 percent under the Standardized approach exceeded its new CET1 capital ratio requirement that was effective October 1, 2022. Our minimum CET1 capital ratio requirement under the Advanced approaches remains unchanged at 9.5 percent. 

The Corporation is required to calculate its G-SIB surcharge on an annual basis under two methods and is subject to the higher of the resulting two surcharges. Method 1 is consistent with the approach prescribed by the Basel Committee&#8217;s assessment methodology and is calculated using specified indicators of systemic importance. Method 2 modifies the Method 1 approach by, among other factors, including a measure of the Corporation&#8217;s reliance on short-term wholesale funding. The Corporation&#8217;s G-SIB surcharge, which is higher under Method 2, is expected to increase to 3.0 percent on January 1, 2024 unless its surcharge calculated as of December 31, 2022 is lower than 3.0 percent. 

The Corporation is also required to maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Our insured depository institution subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be considered well capitalized under the PCA framework. 

Capital Composition and Ratios 

Table 8 presents Bank of America Corporation&#8217;s capital ratios and related information in accordance with Basel 3 Standardized and Advanced approaches as measured at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. For the periods presented herein, the Corporation met the definition of well capitalized under current regulatory requirements.

(1) Capital ratios as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 are calculated using the regulatory capital rule that allows a five-year transition period related to the adoption of the current expected credit losses (CECL) accounting standard. 

(2) The capital conservation buffer and G-SIB surcharge were 2.5 percent at both September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. At both September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Corporation's SCB of 2.5 percent was applied in place of the capital conservation buffer under the Standardized approach. The countercyclical capital buffer for both periods was zero. The CET1 capital regulatory minimum is the sum of the CET1 capital ratio minimum of 4.5 percent, our G-SIB surcharge of 2.5 percent and our SCB or the capital conservation buffer, as applicable, of 2.5 percent. The SLR regulatory minimum includes a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent. 

(3) Total capital under the Advanced approaches differs from the Standardized approach due to differences in the amount permitted in Tier 2 capital related to the qualifying allowance for credit losses. 

(4) Reflects total average assets adjusted for certain Tier 1 capital deductions. 

At September 30, 2022, CET1 capital was $175.6 billion, an increase of $3.8 billion from December 31, 2021, due to earnings, partially offset by dividends, an increase in net unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities included in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI), and common stock repurchases. Tier 1 capital increased $8.2 billion primarily driven by the same factors as CET1 capital as well as non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock issuances. Total capital under the Standardized approach increased $7.7 billion primarily due to the same factors driving the increase in Tier 1 

capital and an increase in the adjusted allowance for credit losses included in Tier 2 capital. RWA under the Standardized approach, which yielded the lower CET1 capital ratio at September 30, 2022, decreased $18.5 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 to $1,599 billion primarily due to lower client activity in Global Markets and a decrease in debt securities, partially offset by loan growth. Supplementary leverage exposure at September 30, 2022 decreased $48.2 billion primarily due to lower debt securities, driven by lower deposits, partially offset by loan growth.

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity Requirements 

Total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) consists of the Corporation&#8217;s Tier 1 capital and eligible long-term debt issued directly by the Corporation. Eligible long-term debt for TLAC ratios is comprised of unsecured debt that has a remaining maturity of at least one year and satisfies additional requirements as prescribed in the TLAC final rule. As with the 

risk-based capital ratios and SLR, the Corporation is required to maintain TLAC ratios in excess of minimum requirements plus applicable buffers to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Table 12 presents the Corporation's TLAC and long-term debt ratios and related information as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

(1) As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, TLAC ratios are calculated using the regulatory capital rule that allows a five-year transition period related to the adoption of CECL. 

(2) The TLAC RWA regulatory minimum consists of 18.0 percent plus a TLAC RWA buffer comprised of 2.5 percent plus the Method 1 G-SIB surcharge of 1.5 percent. The countercyclical buffer is zero for both periods. The TLAC supplementary leverage exposure regulatory minimum consists of 7.5 percent plus a 2.0 percent TLAC leverage buffer. The TLAC RWA and leverage buffers must be comprised solely of CET1 capital and Tier 1 capital, respectively. 

(3) The long-term debt RWA regulatory minimum is comprised of 6.0 percent plus an additional 2.5 percent requirement based on the Corporation&#8217;s Method 2 G-SIB surcharge. The long-term debt leverage exposure regulatory minimum is 4.5 percent. 

(4) The approach that yields the higher RWA is used to calculate TLAC and long-term debt ratios, which was the Standardized approach as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 

Regulatory Developments 

For information on regulatory developments, see Capital Management &#8211; Regulatory Developments in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Regulatory Capital and Securities Regulation 

The Corporation&#8217;s principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are BofA Securities, Inc. (BofAS), Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp. (MLPCC) and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &#38; Smith Incorporated (MLPF&#38;S). The Corporation's principal European broker-dealer subsidiaries are Merrill Lynch International (MLI) and BofA Securities Europe SA (BofASE). 

The U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the net capital requirements of Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act. BofAS computes its minimum capital requirements as an alternative net capital broker-dealer under Rule 15c3-1e, and MLPCC and MLPF&#38;S compute their minimum capital requirements in accordance with the alternative standard under Rule 15c3-1. BofAS and MLPCC are also registered as futures commission merchants and are subject to Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Regulation 1.17. The U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are also registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA). Pursuant to FINRA Rule 4110, FINRA may impose higher net capital requirements than Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act with respect to each of the broker-dealers. 

BofAS provides institutional services, and in accordance with the alternative net capital requirements, is required to maintain tentative net capital in excess of $5.0 billion and net capital in excess of the greater of $1.0 billion or a certain percentage of its reserve requirement in addition to a certain percentage of securities-based swap risk margin. BofAS must also notify the SEC in the event its tentative net capital is less than $6.0 billion. BofAS is also required to hold a certain percentage of its customers' and affiliates' risk-based margin in order to meet its CFTC minimum net capital requirement. At September 30, 2022, BofAS had tentative net capital of $19.1 billion. BofAS also had regulatory net capital of $16.2 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement of $4.1 billion. 

MLPCC is a fully-guaranteed subsidiary of BofAS and provides clearing and settlement services as well as prime brokerage and arranged financing services for institutional clients. At September 30, 2022, MLPCC&#8217;s regulatory net capital of $7.8 billion exceeded the minimum requirement of $1.5 billion. 

MLPF&#38;S provides retail services. At September 30, 2022, MLPF&#38;S' regulatory net capital was $5.6 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement of $158 million. 

Our European broker-dealers are subject to requirements from U.S. and non-U.S. regulators. MLI, a U.K. investment firm, is regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority and is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. At September 30, 2022, MLI&#8217;s capital resources were $33.1 billion, which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $12.1 billion. BofASE, a French investment firm, is regulated by the Autorit&#233; de Contr&#244;le Prudentiel et de R&#233;solution and the Autorit&#233; des March&#233;s Financiers, and is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. At September 30, 2022, BofASE's capital resources were $7.5 billion, which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $3.2 billion. 

In addition, MLI and BofASE became conditionally registered with the SEC as security-based swap dealers in the fourth quarter of 2021, and maintained net liquid assets at September 30, 2022 that exceeded the applicable minimum requirements under the Exchange Act. 

Liquidity Risk 

Funding and Liquidity Risk Management 

Our primary liquidity risk management objective is to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral requirements, including payments under long-term debt agreements, commitments to extend credit and customer deposit withdrawals, while continuing to support our businesses and customers under a range of economic conditions. To achieve that objective, we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk under expected and stressed conditions, maintain liquidity and access to diverse funding sources, including our stable deposit base, and seek to align liquidity-related incentives and risks. These liquidity risk management practices have allowed us to effectively manage the market fluctuation from the rising interest rate environment, inflationary pressures and macroeconomic environment. 

We define liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we can use to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations as they arise. We manage our liquidity position through line-of-business and ALM activities, as well as through our legal entity funding strategy, on both a forward and current (including intraday) basis under both expected and stressed conditions. We believe that a centralized approach to funding 

27 Bank of America 

and liquidity management enhances our ability to monitor liquidity requirements, maximizes access to funding sources, minimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely responses to liquidity events. For more information regarding global funding and liquidity risk management, as well as liquidity sources, liquidity arrangements, contingency planning and credit ratings discussed below, see Liquidity Risk in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

NB Holdings Corporation 

The parent company, which is a separate and distinct legal entity from our bank and nonbank subsidiaries, has an intercompany arrangement with our wholly-owned holding company subsidiary, NB Holdings Corporation (NB Holdings). We have transferred, and agreed to transfer, additional parent company assets not required to satisfy anticipated near-term expenditures to NB Holdings. The parent company is expected to continue to have access to the same flow of dividends, interest and other amounts of cash necessary to service its debt, pay dividends and perform other obligations as it would have had it not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets. These arrangements support our preferred single point of entry resolution strategy, under which only the parent company would be resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 

Global Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered Assets 

Table 13 presents average Global Liquidity Sources (GLS) for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

178 &#160; 152 Total Average Global Liquidity Sources 

$ 941 &#160; $ 1,158 

(1) Nonbank includes Parent, NB Holdings and other regulated entities. 

Our bank subsidiaries&#8217; liquidity is primarily driven by deposit and lending activity, as well as securities valuation and net debt activity. Bank subsidiaries can also generate incremental liquidity by pledging a range of unencumbered loans and securities to certain Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The cash we could have obtained by borrowing against this pool of specifically-identified eligible assets was $349 billion and $322 billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. We have established operational procedures to enable us to borrow against these assets, including regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible loans and securities collateral. Eligibility is defined in guidelines from the FHLBs and the Federal Reserve and is subject to change at their discretion. Due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries can generally be used only to fund obligations within the bank subsidiaries, and transfers to the parent company or nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to prior regulatory approval. 

Liquidity is also held in nonbank entities, including the parent, NB Holdings and other regulated entities. The parent company and NB Holdings liquidity is typically in the form of cash deposited at BANA, which is excluded from the liquidity at 

bank subsidiaries, and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. Liquidity held in other regulated entities, comprised primarily of broker-dealer subsidiaries, is primarily available to meet the obligations of that entity, and transfers to the parent company or to any other subsidiary may be subject to prior regulatory approval due to regulatory restrictions and minimum requirements. Our other regulated entities also hold unencumbered investment-grade securities and equities that we believe could be used to generate additional liquidity. 

Table 14 presents the composition of average GLS for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 

Table 14 Average Global Liquidity Sources Composition Three Months Ended (Dollars in billions) September 30 2022 December 31 2021 Cash on deposit $ 184 &#160; $ 259 U.S. Treasury securities 255 &#160; 278 U.S. agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, and other investment-grade securities

15 &#160; 15 Total Average Global Liquidity Sources $ 941 &#160; $ 1,158 

Our GLS are substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the final U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) rules. However, HQLA for purposes of calculating LCR is not reported at market value, but at a lower value that incorporates regulatory deductions and the exclusion of excess liquidity held at certain subsidiaries. The LCR is calculated as the amount of a financial institution&#8217;s unencumbered HQLA relative to the estimated net cash outflows the institution could encounter over a 30-day period of significant liquidity stress, expressed as a percentage. Our average consolidated HQLA, on a net basis, was $618 billion and $617 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. For the same periods, the average consolidated LCR was 123 percent and 115 percent. Our LCR fluctuates due to normal business flows from customer activity. 

Liquidity Stress Analysis 

We utilize liquidity stress analysis to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our subsidiaries to meet contractual and contingent cash outflows under a range of scenarios. For more information on liquidity stress analysis, see Liquidity Risk &#8211; Liquidity Stress Analysis in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Net Stable Funding Ratio 

The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) is a liquidity requirement for large banks to maintain a minimum level of stable funding over a one-year period. The requirement is intended to support the ability of banks to lend to households and businesses in both normal and adverse economic conditions and is complementary to the LCR, which focuses on short-term liquidity risks. The U.S. NSFR applies to the Corporation on a consolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions. At September 30, 2022, the Corporation and its insured depository institutions were in compliance with this requirement. 

Bank of America 28 

Diversified Funding Sources 

We fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits, and secured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally coordinated funding approach diversified across products, programs, markets, currencies and investor groups. We fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposits, which totaled $1.9 trillion and $2.1 trillion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 

Our trading activities in other regulated entities are primarily funded on a secured basis through securities lending and repurchase agreements, and these amounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions. 

Long-term Debt 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we issued $56.0 billion of long-term debt consisting of $41.5 billion of notes issued by Bank of America Corporation, substantially all of which was TLAC compliant, $5.9 billion of notes issued by Bank of America, N.A. and $8.6 billion of other debt, which is primarily structured liabilities. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we had total long-term debt maturities and redemptions in the aggregate of $24.3 billion consisting of $13.6 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $7.6 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $3.1 billion of other debt. Table 15 presents the carrying value of aggregate annual contractual maturities of long-term debt at September 30, 2022.

For more information on our TLAC eligible and callable outstanding notes, see Liquidity Risk &#8211; Diversified Funding Sources in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

(2) Represents liabilities of consolidated variable interest entities (VIEs) included in total long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

Total long-term debt decreased $11.0 billion to $269.1 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to debt valuation adjustments, maturities and redemptions, partially offset by debt issuances. We may, from time to time, purchase outstanding debt instruments in various transactions, depending on market conditions, liquidity and other factors. Our other regulated entities may also make markets in our debt instruments to provide liquidity for investors. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we issued $8.6 billion of structured notes, which are debt obligations that pay investors returns linked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. These structured notes are typically issued to meet client demand, and notes with certain attributes may also be TLAC eligible. We typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these liabilities with derivatives and/or investments in the underlying instruments, so that from a funding perspective, the cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. We could be required to settle certain structured note obligations for cash or other securities prior to maturity under certain circumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning purposes. We believe, however, that a portion of such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or redemption date. 

Substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price. For more information on long-term debt funding, including issuances and maturities and redemptions, see Note 11 &#8211; Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

We use derivative transactions to manage the duration, interest rate and currency risks of our borrowings, considering the characteristics of the assets they are funding. For more information on our ALM activities, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 45. 

Credit Ratings 

Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by rating agencies on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and other securities, including asset securitizations. Table 16 presents the Corporation&#8217;s current long-term/short-term senior debt ratings and outlooks expressed by the rating agencies.

Finance Subsidiary Issuers and Parent Guarantor 

BofA Finance LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (BofA Finance), is a consolidated finance subsidiary of the Corporation that has issued and sold, and is expected to continue to issue and sell, its senior unsecured debt securities (Guaranteed Notes) that are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Corporation. The Corporation guarantees the due and punctual payment, on demand, of amounts payable on the Guaranteed Notes if not paid by BofA Finance. In addition, each of BAC Capital Trust XIII, BAC Capital Trust XIV and BAC Capital Trust XV, Delaware statutory trusts (collectively, the Trusts), is a 100 percent owned finance subsidiary of the Corporation that has issued and sold trust preferred securities (the Trust Preferred Securities) or capital securities (the Capital Securities and, together with the Guaranteed Notes and the Trust Preferred Securities, the Guaranteed Securities), as applicable, that remained outstanding at September 30, 2022. The Corporation has fully and unconditionally guaranteed (or effectively provided for the full and unconditional guarantee of) all such securities issued by such finance subsidiaries. For more information regarding such guarantees by the Corporation, see Liquidity Risk &#8211; Finance Subsidiary Issuers and Parent Guarantor in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Credit Risk Management 

For information on our credit risk management activities, see the following: Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management, Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 35, Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 41, Allowance for Credit Losses on page 42, and Note 5 &#8211; Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, asset quality continued to improve. Excluding losses associated with non-core mortgage sales, our net charge-off ratio remained near historic lows, and nonperforming loans and commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure decreased, which was partially offset by an increase in reservable criticized exposure 

associated with our direct exposure to Russia as a result of the Russia/Ukraine conflict. While uncertainty around the pandemic has largely dissipated, uncertainty remains regarding broader economic impacts as a result of inflationary pressures, rising rates and the current geopolitical situation and could lead to adverse impacts to credit quality metrics in future periods. 

Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management 

Credit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower&#8217;s credit cycle. Statistical techniques in conjunction with experiential judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio management including underwriting, product pricing, risk appetite, setting credit limits, and establishing operating processes and metrics to quantify and balance risks and returns. Statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external sources, such as credit bureaus and/or internal historical experience, and are a component of our consumer credit risk management process. These models are used in part to assist in making both new and ongoing credit decisions, as well as portfolio management strategies, including authorizations and line management, collection practices and strategies, and determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses and allocated capital for credit risk. 

Consumer Credit Portfolio 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the U.S. unemployment rate continued to decline and home prices increased compared to the same period a year ago; however, inflationary pressures continued to persist. Net charge-offs increased $130 million to $459 million during the three months ended September 30, 2022 and decreased $211 million to $1.3 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. The increase in the three-month period was primarily due to overdrafts charged off in other consumer, and the decrease in the nine-month period was primarily due to lower credit card losses, as loss rates remain near historic lows. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, nonperforming loans declined primarily due to decreases from consumer real estate loan sales, partially offset by increases from loans with expired deferrals that were modified as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) during the first quarter of 2022. 

Bank of America 30 

The consumer allowance for loan and lease losses decreased $153 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 to $6.9 billion. For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 42.

We believe that the presentation of information adjusted to exclude the impact of the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option is more representative of the ongoing operations and credit quality of the business. As a result, in the following tables and discussions of the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios, we exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option and provide information that excludes the impact of the fully-insured loan portfolio in certain credit quality statistics. 

Residential Mortgage 

The residential mortgage portfolio made up the largest percentage of our consumer loan portfolio at 51 percent of consumer loans and leases at September 30, 2022. Approximately 52 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio was in Consumer Banking and 45 percent was in GWIM. The 

remaining portion was in All Other . 

Outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio increased $7.1 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 as originations were partially offset by paydowns and loan sales. 

At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the residential mortgage portfolio included $11.9 billion and $12.7 billion of outstanding fully-insured loans, of which both had FHA insurance of $2.2 billion, with the remainder protected by Fannie Mae long-term standby agreements. 

Table 19 presents certain residential mortgage key credit statistics on both a reported basis and excluding the fully-insured loan portfolio. The following discussion presents the residential mortgage portfolio excluding the fully-insured loan portfolio.

(2) Includes loans that are contractually current which primarily consist of collateral-dependent TDRs, including those that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy and loans that have not yet demonstrated a sustained period of payment performance following a TDR. 

Nonperforming outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio decreased $97 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 primarily due to decreases from consumer real estate loan sales in the second quarter of 2022, partially offset by increases from loans with expired deferrals that were modified as TDRs during the first quarter of 2022. Of the nonperforming residential mortgage loans at September 30, 2022, $1.4 billion, or 65 percent, were current on contractual payments. Loans accruing past due 30 days or more decreased $146 million. 

Net recoveries of $3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 remained relatively unchanged compared to the same period in 2021. Net charge-offs of $73 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 increased $90 million compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to loan sales that occurred in the second quarter of 2022. 

Of the $217.1 billion in total residential mortgage loans outstanding at September 30, 2022, 28 percent were originated as interest-only loans. The outstanding balance of interest-only residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period was $3.4 billion, or six percent, at September 30, 2022. Residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period generally experienced a higher rate of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status compared to the residential mortgage portfolio as a whole. At September 30, 

2022, $37 million, or one percent, of outstanding interest-only residential mortgages that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more compared to $720 million, or less than one percent, for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, at September 30, 2022, $213 million, or six percent, of outstanding interest-only residential mortgage loans that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming, of which $84 million were contractually current. Loans that have yet to enter the amortization period in our interest-only residential mortgage portfolio are primarily well-collateralized loans to our wealth management clients and have an interest-only period of three to ten years. Approximately 95 percent of these loans that have yet to enter the amortization period will not be required to make a fully-amortizing payment until 2025 or later. 

Table 20 presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the residential mortgage portfolio. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) within California represented 14 percent and 15 percent of outstandings at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 15 percent of outstandings at both September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

Home Equity 

At September 30, 2022, the home equity portfolio made up six percent of the consumer portfolio and was comprised of home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), home equity loans and reverse mortgages. HELOCs generally have an initial draw period of 10 years, and after the initial draw period ends, the loans generally 

convert to 15- or 20-year amortizing loans. We no longer originate home equity loans or reverse mortgages. 

At September 30, 2022, 82 percent of the home equity portfolio was in Consumer Banking , nine percent was in All Other and the remainder of the portfolio was primarily in GWIM . Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased 

Bank of America 32 

$1.1 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 primarily due to paydowns outpacing draws on existing lines and new originations. Of the total home equity portfolio at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, $11.4 billion and $12.2 billion, or 43 percent and 44 percent, were in first-lien positions. At September 30, 2022, outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio that were in a second-lien or more junior-lien position and where we also held the first-lien loan 

totaled $4.6 billion, or 17 percent of our total home equity portfolio. 

Unused HELOCs totaled $41.4 billion and $40.5 billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The HELOC utilization rate was 38 percent and 39 percent at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

Nonperforming outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased $98 million to $532 million at September 30, 2022, primarily driven by loan sales. Of the nonperforming home equity loans at September 30, 2022, $277 million, or 52 percent, were current on contractual payments. In addition, $189 million, or 36 percent, of nonperforming home equity loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell. Accruing loans that were 30 days or more past due decreased $74 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. 

Net recoveries decreased $16 million to $18 million and $21 million to $72 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. 

Of the $26.8 billion in total home equity portfolio outstandings at September 30, 2022, as shown in Table 21, 14 percent require interest-only payments. The outstanding balance of HELOCs that have reached the end of their draw period and have entered the amortization period was $5.5 billion at September 30, 2022. The HELOCs that have entered the amortization period have experienced a higher percentage of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status when 

compared to the HELOC portfolio as a whole. At September 30, 2022, $47 million, or one percent, of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more. In addition, at September 30, 2022, $380 million, or seven percent, were nonperforming. 

For our interest-only HELOC portfolio, we do not actively track how many of our home equity customers pay only the minimum amount due on their home equity loans and lines; however, we can infer some of this information through a review of our HELOC portfolio that we service and is still in its revolving period. During the three months ended September 30, 2022, 21 percent of these customers with an outstanding balance did not pay any principal on their HELOCs. 

Table 22 presents outstandings, nonperforming balances and net recoveries by certain state concentrations for the home equity portfolio. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 13 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana MSA within California made up 11 percent and 10 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

Credit Card 

At September 30, 2022, 97 percent of the credit card portfolio was managed in Consumer Banking with the remainder in GWIM . Outstandings in the credit card portfolio increased $5.9 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 to $87.3 billion primarily driven by increased purchase volumes, partially offset by the transfer of a $1.6 billion affinity card loan portfolio to held for sale that was sold in October 2022. Net charge-offs increased $7 million to $328 million during the three months ended September 30, 2022 and decreased $495 million to $948 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021, as loss rates 

remained near historic lows. In addition, the nine-month period in the prior year included charge-offs associated with deferrals that expired in 2020. Credit card loans 30 days or more past due and still accruing interest increased $205 million, and 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest increased $60 million. 

Unused lines of credit for credit card increased to $367.4 billion at September 30, 2022 from $361.2 billion at December 31, 2021.

Direct/Indirect Consumer 

At September 30, 2022, 47 percent of the direct/indirect portfolio was included in Consumer Banking (consumer auto and recreational vehicle lending) and 53 percent was included in GWIM (principally securities-based lending loans). Outstandings in the direct/indirect portfolio increased $3.6 billion during 

the nine months ended September 30, 2022 to $107.2 billion driven by growth in our auto portfolio and client demand for liquidity in securities-based lending.

Nonperforming Consumer Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity 

Table 25 presents nonperforming consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, nonperforming consumer loans decreased $229 million to $2.8 billion primarily due to decreases from loan sales, partially offset by increases from loans with expired deferrals that were modified as TDRs during the first quarter of 2022. 

At September 30, 2022, $639 million, or 23 percent, of nonperforming loans were 180 days or more past due and had 

been written down to their estimated property value less costs to sell. In addition, at September 30, 2022, $1.7 billion, or 63 percent, of nonperforming consumer loans were modified and are now current after successful trial periods, or are current loans classified as nonperforming loans in accordance with applicable policies. 

Foreclosed properties increased $24 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 to $125 million. Nonperforming loans also include certain loans that have been modified in TDRs where economic concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties.

(3) At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, home equity TDRs deemed collateral dependent totaled $413 million and $370 million, and include $290 million and $222 million of loans classified as nonperforming and $123 million and $148 million of loans classified as performing. 

In addition to modifying consumer real estate loans, we work with customers who are experiencing financial difficulty by modifying credit card and other consumer loans. Credit card and other consumer loan modifications generally involve a reduction in the customer&#8217;s interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months. 

Modifications of credit card and other consumer loans are made through programs utilizing direct customer contact, but may also utilize external programs. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, our credit card and other consumer TDR portfolio was $608 million and $672 million, of which $533 million and $599 million were current or less than 30 days past due under the modified terms. 

Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management 

Commercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal that concentrations of credit exposure continue to be aligned with our risk appetite. We review, measure and manage concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, customer relationship and loan size. We also review, measure and manage commercial real estate loans by geographic location and property type. In addition, within our non-U.S. portfolio, we evaluate exposures by region and by country. Tables 31, 34 and 37 summarize our concentrations. We also utilize syndications of exposure to third parties, loan sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of the commercial credit portfolio. For 

more information on our industry concentrations, see Table 34 and Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management &#8211; Industry Concentrations on page 39. 

For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, net charge-offs and TDRs for the commercial portfolio, see Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Commercial Credit Portfolio 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, commercial credit quality improved as charge-offs, nonperforming commercial loans and reservable criticized utilized exposure declined during this period. Due to the ongoing Russia/Ukraine conflict, all direct exposure to Russian counterparties was downgraded and reported as reservable criticized exposure, and expected credit losses have been incorporated into our estimate of the allowance for credit losses. Outstanding commercial loans and leases increased $38.2 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 due to growth in commercial and industrial, primarily in Global Banking . This increase was partially offset by lower U.S. small business commercial loans due to repayments of PPP loans by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the terms of the program. For more information on PPP loans, see Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the 

35 Bank of America 

Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Credit quality of commercial real estate borrowers continued to stabilize as pandemic-impacted sectors are recovering. However, many real estate markets, while improving, are still experiencing disruptions in demand, supply chain challenges, tenant difficulties and challenging capital markets. Demand for office space continues to be uncertain as companies evaluate space needs with employment models that utilize a mix of remote and conventional office use. 

The commercial allowance for loan and lease losses remained relatively unchanged at $5.4 billion at September 30, 2022, as asset quality improvement and reduced pandemic uncertainties were offset by a dampening macroeconomic outlook, loan growth and a reserve build related to Russian exposure. For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 42. 

Total commercial utilized credit exposure increased $65.0 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 to $718.6 billion primarily driven by higher loans and leases and derivative assets. The utilization rate for loans and leases, standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and financial guarantees, and commercial letters of credit, in the aggregate, was 57 percent and 56 percent at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 

Table 27 presents commercial credit exposure by type for utilized, unfunded and total binding committed credit exposure. Commercial utilized credit exposure includes SBLCs and financial guarantees and commercial letters of credit that have been issued and for which we are legally bound to advance funds under prescribed conditions during a specified time period, and excludes exposure related to trading account assets. Although funds have not yet been advanced, these exposure types are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes.

Table 30 presents commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure by loan type. Criticized exposure corresponds to the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful asset categories as defined by regulatory authorities. Total commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure decreased $4.7 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, which was broad-based across industries. At both September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, 87 percent of commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure was secured.

Commercial and Industrial 

Commercial and industrial loans include U.S. commercial and non-U.S. commercial portfolios. 

U.S. Commercial 

At September 30, 2022, 64 percent of the U.S. commercial loan portfolio, excluding small business, was managed in Global Banking, 20 percent in Global Markets , 15 percent in GWIM (loans that provide financing for asset purchases, business investments and other liquidity needs for high net worth clients) and the remainder primarily in Consumer Banking . U.S. commercial loans increased $29.4 billion, or nine percent, during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 primarily driven by Global Banking . Reservable criticized utilized exposure decreased $1.5 billion, or 13 percent, driven by decreases across a broad range of industries. 

Non-U.S. Commercial 

At September 30, 2022, 66 percent of the non-U.S. commercial loan portfolio was managed in Global Banking, 33 percent in Global Markets and the remainder in GWIM . Non-U.S. commercial loans increased $9.8 billion, or nine percent, during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, as loan growth in Global Banking and Global Markets was partially offset by foreign currency valuation adjustments on foreign currency-denominated loans. Reservable criticized utilized exposure increased $101 

million, or four percent, due to downgrades for direct exposure to Russian counterparties. For information on the non-U.S. commercial portfolio, see Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 41. For more information on the Russia/Ukraine conflict, see Recent Developments on page 3. 

Commercial Real Estate 

Commercial real estate primarily includes commercial loans secured by non-owner-occupied real estate and is dependent on the sale or lease of the real estate as the primary source of repayment. Outstanding loans increased $4.9 billion, or eight percent, during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 to $68.0 billion due to new originations outpacing paydowns and increased utilizations under existing credit facilities. Reservable criticized utilized exposure decreased $3.0 billion, or 40 percent, primarily driven by Hotels due to improving vacancy rates and reduced travel restrictions. The portfolio remains diversified across property types and geographic regions. California represented the largest state concentration at 20 percent and 21 percent of the commercial real estate portfolio at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The commercial real estate portfolio is predominantly managed in Global Banking and consists of loans made primarily to public and private developers, and commercial real estate firms. 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, we continued to see low default rates and varying 

37 Bank of America 

degrees of improvement in certain geographic regions and property types of the portfolio. We use a number of proactive risk mitigation initiatives to reduce adversely rated exposure in the commercial real estate portfolio, including transfers of deteriorating exposures for management by independent special asset officers and the pursuit of loan restructurings or asset 

sales to achieve the best results for our customers and the Corporation.

U.S. Small Business Commercial 

The U.S. small business commercial loan portfolio is comprised of small business card loans and small business loans primarily managed in Consumer Banking, and included $1.5 billion and $4.7 billion of PPP loans outstanding at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The decline of $3.2 billion in PPP loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily due to repayment of the loans by the SBA under the terms of the program. Excluding PPP, credit card-related products were 54 percent and 50 percent of the U.S. small business commercial portfolio at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 and represented all of the net charge-offs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to 100 percent and 96 percent for the same periods in 2021. The increase of $165 million in accruing past due 90 days or more for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was driven by PPP loans, which are fully guaranteed by the SBA. 

Nonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity 

Table 32 presents the nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. Nonperforming loans do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, nonperforming commercial loans and leases decreased $355 million to $1.2 billion. At September 30, 2022, 98 percent of commercial nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties were secured and 56 percent were contractually current. Commercial nonperforming loans were carried at 86 percent of their unpaid principal balance, as the carrying value of these loans has been reduced to the estimated collateral value less costs to sell.

(3) Commercial loans and leases may be returned to performing status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected, or when the loan otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection. TDRs are generally classified as performing after a sustained period of demonstrated payment performance. 

(4) Outstanding commercial loans exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. 

Table 33 presents our commercial TDRs by product type and performing status. U.S. small business commercial TDRs are comprised of renegotiated small business card loans and small business loans. The renegotiated small business card loans are not classified as nonperforming as they are charged off no later 

than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due. Commercial TDRs increased $799 million, or 42 percent, during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 primarily due to commercial real estate loans that were modified as TDRs during the first half of the year.

Industry Concentrations 

Table 34 presents commercial committed and utilized credit exposure by industry. For information on net notional credit protection purchased to hedge funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management &#8211; Risk Mitigation. 

Our commercial credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of industries. Total commercial committed exposure increased $71.2 billion, or six percent, during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 to $1.2 trillion. The increase in commercial committed exposure was concentrated in Asset managers and funds, Global commercial banks and Financial markets infrastructure (clearinghouses). 

For information on industry limits, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management &#8211; Industry Concentrations in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K . 

Asset managers and funds, our largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $172.5 billion, 

increased $35.6 billion, or 26 percent, during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, which was primarily driven by investment-grade exposures. 

Real estate, our second largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $98.6 billion, increased $2.4 billion, or two percent, during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. For more information on the commercial real estate and related portfolios, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management &#8211; Commercial Real Estate on page 37. 

Capital goods, our third largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $89.4 billion, increased $5.2 billion, or six percent, during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. 

While the U.S. and global economies have shown signs of relief from the pandemic, uncertainty remains as a result of geopolitical and inflationary pressures, and a number of industries will likely continue to be adversely impacted due to these conditions. We continue to monitor all industries, particularly higher risk industries that are experiencing or could experience a more significant impact to their financial condition.

(2) Includes the notional amount of unfunded legally binding lending commitments, net of amounts distributed (i.e., syndicated or participated) to other financial institutions. The distributed amounts were $10.4 billion and $10.7 billion at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 

(3) Industries are viewed from a variety of perspectives to best isolate the perceived risks. For purposes of this table, the real estate industry is defined based on the primary business activity of the borrowers or counterparties using operating cash flows and primary source of repayment as key factors. 

Risk Mitigation 

We purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain credit exposures. To lower the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, we may add credit exposure within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection. 

At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, net notional credit default protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, was $9.1 billion and $2.6 billion. We recorded net losses of $56 million and gains of $66 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to net losses of $18 million and $86 million for the same periods in 2021. The gains and losses on these instruments were largely offset by gains and losses on the related exposures. The Value-at-Risk (VaR) results for these exposures are included in the fair value option portfolio information in Table 40. For more information, see Trading Risk Management on page 44.

Non-U.S. Portfolio 

Our non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios are subject to country risk. We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes in government policies. A risk management framework is in place to measure, monitor and manage non-U.S. risk and exposures. In addition to the direct risk of doing business in a country, we also are exposed to indirect country risks (e.g., related to the collateral received on secured financing transactions or related to client clearing 

activities). These indirect exposures are managed in the normal course of business through credit, market and operational risk governance rather than through country risk governance. For more information on our non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios, see Non-U.S. Portfolio in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Table 37 presents our 20 largest non-U.S. country exposures at September 30, 2022. These exposures accounted for 89 percent of our total non-U.S. exposure at both September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Net country exposure for these 20 countries increased $1.8 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 primarily driven by increases in Japan, the United Kingdom, Ireland and India, partially offset by reductions in France, Canada and Australia.

Our largest non-U.S. country exposure at September 30, 2022 was the United Kingdom with net exposure of $58.0 billion, which represents a $3.0 billion increase from December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily driven by net counterparty exposure with financial institutions, partially offset by a reduction in deposits with the central bank. Our second 

largest non-U.S. country exposure was Germany with net exposure of $33.5 billion at September 30, 2022, a $280 million decrease from December 31, 2021. The reduction was driven by a decrease in exposure with financial institutions and corporates, offset by an increase in deposits with the central bank.

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The allowance for credit losses decreased $26 million from December 31, 2021 to $13.8 billion at September 30, 2022, which included a $171 million reserve decrease related to the consumer portfolio and a $145 million reserve increase related to the commercial portfolio. The decrease in the allowance was primarily driven by asset quality improvement and reduced 

pandemic uncertainties, partially offset by reserve builds related to loan growth, a dampening macroeconomic outlook and Russian exposure.

Net charge-offs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 were $520 million and $1.5 billion compared to $463 million and $1.9 billion for the same periods in 2021. During the three months ended September 30, 2022, net charge-offs increased $57 million, or 12 percent, primarily due to overdrafts charged off in other consumer. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, net charge-offs decreased $398 million, or 21 percent, primarily driven by lower credit card losses, as loss rates remained near historic lows. The provision for credit losses increased $1.5 billion to an expense of $898 million, and $5.6 billion to an expense of $1.5 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. The provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily driven by loan growth and a dampening macroeconomic outlook, and the nine-month period was driven by the same factors as well as a reserve build related to Russian exposure, partially offset by asset quality improvement and reduced pandemic uncertainties. For the same periods in the prior year, the benefit in the provision for credit losses was due to an improved macroeconomic outlook. The provision for credit losses for the 

consumer portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, increased $641 million to an expense of $722 million and $2.5 billion to an expense of $1.1 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021. The provision for credit losses for the commercial portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, increased $881 million to an expense of $176 million and $3.0 billion to an expense of $304 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021.

Market Risk Management 

For more information on our market risk management process, see Market Risk Management in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions may adversely impact the value of assets or liabilities, or otherwise negatively impact earnings. This risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations, primarily within our Global Markets segment. We are also exposed to these risks in other areas of the Corporation (e.g., our ALM activities). In the event of market stress, these risks could have a material impact on our results. 

Trading Risk Management 

To evaluate risks in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of revenues generated by individual positions as well as portfolios of positions. VaR is a common statistic used to measure market risk. Our primary VaR statistic is equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level, which means that for a VaR with a one-day holding period, there should not be losses in excess of VaR, on average, 99 out of 100 trading days. 

Table 40 presents the total market-based portfolio VaR, which is the combination of the total covered positions (and 

less liquid trading positions) portfolio and the fair value option portfolio. For more information on the market risk VaR for trading activities, see Trading Risk Management in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

The total market-based portfolio VaR results in Table 40 include market risk to which we are exposed from all business segments, excluding credit valuation adjustment (CVA), DVA and related hedges. The majority of this portfolio is within the Global Markets segment. 

Table 40 presents period-end, average, high and low daily trading VaR for the three months ended September 30, 2022, June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021 using a 99 percent confidence level as well as average daily trading VaR for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. The amounts disclosed in Table 40 and Table 41 align to the view of covered positions used in the Basel 3 capital calculations. Foreign exchange and commodity positions are always considered covered positions, regardless of trading or banking treatment for the trade, except for structural foreign currency positions that are excluded with prior regulatory approval. 

The average of total covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio VaR for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the prior quarter remained relatively unchanged.

Additional VaR statistics produced within our single VaR model are provided in Table 41 at the same level of detail as in Table 40. Evaluating VaR with additional statistics allows for an increased understanding of the risks in the portfolio, as the historical market data used in the VaR calculation does not necessarily follow a predefined statistical distribution. Table 41 presents average trading VaR statistics at 99 percent and 95 percent confidence levels for the three months ended September 30, 2022, June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021.

Backtesting 

The accuracy of the VaR methodology is evaluated by backtesting, which compares the daily VaR results, utilizing a one-day holding period, against a comparable subset of trading revenue. For more information on our backtesting process, see Trading Risk Management &#8211; Backtesting in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, there was one day where this subset of trading revenue had losses that exceeded our total covered portfolio VaR, utilizing a one-day holding period. 

Total Trading-related Revenue 

Total trading-related revenue, excluding brokerage fees, and CVA, DVA and funding valuation adjustment gains (losses), represents the total amount earned from trading positions, including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. For more information, see Trading Risk Management &#8211; Total Trading-related Revenue in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

The following histogram is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022 and March 31, 2022. During the three months ended September 30, 2022, positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 100 percent of the trading days, of which 94 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million. This compares to the three months ended June 30, 2022 where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 98 percent of the trading days, of which 85 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 100 percent of the trading days, of which 95 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million. 

Trading Portfolio Stress Testing 

Because the very nature of a VaR model suggests results can exceed our estimates and it is dependent on a limited historical window, we also stress test our portfolio using scenario analysis. This analysis estimates the change in the value of our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements. For more information, see Trading Risk Management &#8211; Trading Portfolio Stress Testing in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book 

The following discussion presents net interest income for banking book activities. For more information, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Table 42 presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. 

45 Bank of America 

Table 42 Forward Rates September 30, 2022 &#160; Federal Funds Three-month LIBOR 10-Year Swap Spot rates 3.25 &#160; % 3.75 &#160; % 3.88 &#160; % 12-month forward rates 4.50 &#160; 4.56 &#160; 3.76 &#160; December 31, 2021 Spot rates 0.25 % 0.21 % 1.58 % 12-month forward rates 1.00 1.07 1.84 

Table 43 shows the pretax impact to forecasted net interest income over the next 12 months from September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 resulting from instantaneous parallel and non-parallel shocks to the market-based forward curve. Periodically, we evaluate the scenarios presented so that they are meaningful in the context of the current rate environment. The interest rate scenarios also assume U.S. dollar interest rates are floored at zero. Depending on the level of interest rates, Down-rate scenarios may not receive the full impact of the rate shock, particularly in low rate environments. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the overall decrease in asset sensitivity of our balance sheet to Up-rate scenarios was primarily due to an increase in long-end and short-end rates. We continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel upward move in interest rates with the majority of that impact coming from the short end of the yield curve. Additionally, higher interest rates negatively impact the fair value of our debt securities classified as available for sale and adversely affect accumulated OCI and thus capital levels under the Basel 3 capital rules. Under instantaneous upward parallel shifts, the near-term adverse impact to Basel 3 capital would be reduced over time by offsetting positive impacts to net interest income generated from the banking book activities. For more information on Basel 3, see Capital Management &#8211; Regulatory Capital on page 23.

The sensitivity analysis in Table 43 assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shocks and does not assume any change in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates. As part of our ALM activities, we use securities, certain residential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity. 

The behavior of our deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in 

our projected estimates of net interest income. The sensitivity analysis in Table 43 assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce our benefit in those scenarios. 

Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative Contracts 

We use interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts in our ALM activities to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Specifically, we use those derivatives to manage both the variability in cash flows and changes in fair value of various assets and liabilities arising from those risks. Our interest rate derivative contracts are generally non-leveraged swaps tied to various benchmark interest rates and foreign exchange basis swaps, options, futures and forwards, and our foreign exchange contracts include cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign currency futures contracts, foreign currency forward contracts and options. 

The derivatives used in our ALM activities can be split into two broad categories: designated accounting hedges and other risk management derivatives. Designated accounting hedges are primarily used to manage our exposure to interest rates as described in the Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book section and are included in the sensitivities presented in Table 43. The Corporation also uses foreign currency derivatives in accounting hedges to manage substantially all of the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations. By hedging the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations, the Corporation's market risk exposure in this area is not significant. 

Risk management derivatives are predominantly used to hedge foreign exchange risks related to various foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities and eliminate substantially all foreign currency exposures in the cash flows of the Corporation&#8217;s non-trading foreign currency-denominated financial instruments. These foreign exchange derivatives are sensitive to other market risk exposures such as cross-currency basis spreads and interest rate risk. However, as these features are not a significant component of these foreign exchange derivatives, the market risk related to this exposure is not significant. For more information on the accounting for derivatives, see Note 3 &#8211; Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Mortgage Banking Risk Management 

We originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. We determine whether loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate. 

Changes in interest rates impact the value of interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and the related residential first mortgage loans held-for-sale (LHFS), as well as the value of the MSRs. Because the interest rate risks of these hedged items offset, we combine them into one overall hedged item with one combined economic hedge portfolio consisting of derivative contracts and securities. For more information on IRLCs and the related residential mortgage LHFS, see Mortgage Banking Risk Management in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

There were no significant gains or losses related to the change in fair value of MSR, IRLCs and LHFS, net of gains and 

Bank of America 46 

losses on the hedge portfolio, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. For more information on MSRs, see Note 14 &#8211; Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Climate Risk Management 

Climate-related risks are divided into two major categories: (1) risks related to the transition to a low-carbon economy, which may entail extensive policy, legal, technology and market changes, and (2) risks related to the physical impacts of climate change, driven by extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and floods, as well as chronic longer-term shifts, such as rising average global temperatures and sea levels. These changes and events can have broad impacts on operations, supply chains, distribution networks, customers and markets and are otherwise referred to, respectively, as transition risk and physical risk. These risks can impact both financial and nonfinancial risk types. The impacts of transition risk can lead to and amplify credit risk or market risk by reducing our customers&#8217; operating income or the value of their assets as well as expose us to reputational and/or litigation risk due to increased regulatory scrutiny or negative public sentiment. Physical risk can lead to increased credit risk by diminishing borrowers&#8217; repayment capacity or impacting the value of collateral. In addition, it could pose increased operational risk to our facilities and people. 

In 2021, we publicly announced our commitment to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions in our financing activities, operations, and supply chain before 2050 (Net Zero Goal) and set 2030 emissions targets for our operations and supply chain. In connection with our Net Zero Goal, we committed to reduce emissions by 2030 associated with our financing activities related to auto manufacturing, energy, and power generation (2030 Targets). In our September 2022 Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures report, we disclosed our 2019 and 2020 financed emissions and emissions intensity metrics for these sectors, with 2019 serving as the baseline for our 2030 Targets. 

In line with our participation in the Net Zero Banking Alliance, we plan to disclose the financed emissions for additional portions of our business loan portfolio in 2023, and we expect to set financing activity emission reduction targets for other key sectors by April 2024. These reduction targets are intended to align with the International Energy Agency Net Zero Emissions 2050 global pathway to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. 

Achieving our climate--related goals and targets, including our Net Zero Goal and 2030 Targets, will require technological advances, clearly defined roadmaps for industry sectors, public policies, including those that improve the cost of capital for 

net zero transition and better emissions data reporting, as 

well as ongoing, strong and active engagement with customers, suppliers, investors, government officials and other stakeholders. 

Given the extended period of these and other climate-related goals we have established, our initiatives have not resulted in a significant effect on our results of operations or financial condition in the relevant periods presented herein, and are not expected to have a significant effect on our results of operations or financial condition in the near-term.

The contents of the Corporation&#8217;s website and the 2021 Annual Report to shareholders are not incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

The foregoing discussion and our discussion in the 2021 Annual Report to shareholders regarding our goals and commitments with respect to climate risk management, including environmental transition considerations, include &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are not guarantees of future results or performance and involve certain known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and are often beyond the Corporation&#8217;s control. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, any of these forward-looking statements. 

Complex Accounting Estimates 

Our significant accounting principles, are essential in understanding the MD&#38;A. Many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. We have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments. For more information, see Complex Accounting Estimates in the MD&#38;A of the Corporation&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 1 &#8211; Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation&#8217;s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
