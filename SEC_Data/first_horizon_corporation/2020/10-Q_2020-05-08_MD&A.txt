General Information 

First Horizon National Corporation (&#8220;FHN&#8221;) began as a community bank chartered in 1864. FHN's sole class of common stock, $.625 par value, is listed and trades on the New York Stock Exchange LLC under the symbol FHN. 

FHN is the parent company of First Horizon Bank. First Horizon Bank's principal divisions and subsidiaries operate under the brands of First Horizon Bank, First Horizon Advisors, and FHN Financial. FHN offers regional banking, wealth management and capital market services through the First Horizon family of companies. First Horizon Bank and First Horizon Advisors provide consumer and commercial banking and wealth management services. FHN Financial, which operates partly through a division of First Horizon Bank and partly through subsidiaries, is an industry leader in fixed income sales, trading, and strategies for institutional clients in the U.S. and abroad. First Horizon Bank has over 270 banking offices in seven southeastern U.S. states, and FHN Financial has 29 offices in 18 states across the U.S. 

Segments 

FHN is composed of the following operating segments: 

&#8226; 

Regional banking segment offers financial products and services, including traditional lending and deposit taking, to consumer and commercial customers primarily in the southeast U.S. and other selected markets. Regional banking also provides investments, wealth management, financial planning, trust services and asset management, mortgage banking, credit card, and cash management. Additionally, the regional banking segment includes correspondent banking which provides credit, depository, and other banking related services to other financial institutions nationally. 

&#8226; 

Fixed income segment consists of fixed income securities sales, trading, underwriting, and strategies for institutional clients in the U.S. and abroad, as well as loan sales, portfolio advisory services, and derivative sales. 

&#8226; 

Corporate segment consists of unallocated corporate expenses, expense on subordinated debt issuances, bank-owned life insurance, unallocated interest income associated with excess equity, net impact of raising incremental capital, revenue and expense associated with deferred compensation plans, funds management, tax credit investment activities, derivative valuation adjustments related to prior sales of Visa Class B shares, gain/(loss) on extinguishment of debt, acquisition- and integration-related costs, expenses associated with 

&#160;

rebranding initiatives, and various charges related to restructuring, repositioning, and efficiency efforts. 

&#8226; 

Non-strategic segment consists of run-off consumer lending activities, pre-2009 mortgage banking elements, and the associated ancillary revenues and expenses related to these businesses. Non-strategic also includes the wind-down trust preferred loan portfolio and exited businesses. 

Significant Pending Transactions 

On November 4, 2019, FHN and IBERIABANK Corporation ("IBKC") announced that they had entered into an agreement and plan of merger under which IBKC will merge with FHN in a merger-of-equals transaction. IBKC, headquartered in Lafayette, Louisiana, has 319 offices in 12 states, mostly in the southern and southeastern U.S., and has reported $32.2 billion of total assets, $24.5 billion in loans, and $25.5 billion in deposits, at March 31, 2020. IBKC's common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Stock Market, LLC under the symbol IBKC. Under the merger agreement, each share of IBKC common stock will be converted into 4.584 shares of FHN common stock. After closing, FHN expects IBKC common shares will be converted into approximately 44 percent of the then-outstanding shares of FHN common stock. The merger agreement requires FHN to expand its board of directors to seventeen persons; after closing, eight board positions will be held by current IBKC directors, and nine will be held by current FHN directors. FHN expects the transaction to close in second quarter, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. 

On November 8, 2019, FHN announced an agreement for First Horizon Bank to purchase 30 branches from SunTrust Bank in conjunction with SunTrust Banks, Inc.'s merger with BB&#38;T Corporation, which created Truist Financial Corp. As part of the agreement, FHN will assume approximately $2.4 billion of branch deposits for a 3.40 percent deposit premium and purchase approximately $410 million of branch loans. The branches are in communities in North Carolina (20 branches), Virginia (8 branches), and Georgia (2 branches). FHN expects the purchase to close in third quarter 2020, subject to customary closing conditions. 

In second quarter 2019, FHN sold a subsidiary acquired as part of the Capital Bank Financial Corporation ("CBF") merger (in 2017) , that did not fit within FHN's risk profile. The sale resulted in the removal of approximately $25 million UPB of subprime consumer loans from Loans held-for-sale on FHN's Consolidated Condensed Statements of Condition. 

In relation to all acquisitions, FHN's operating results include the operating results of the acquired assets and 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 1Q20 FORM 10-Q REPORT 78 

assumed liabilities subsequent to the acquisition date. Refer to Note 2 &#8211; Acquisitions and Divestitures in this report and in Item 7 to FHN&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 for additional information. 

For the purpose of this management&#8217;s discussion and analysis (&#8220;MD&#38;A&#8221;), earning assets have been expressed as averages, unless otherwise noted, and loans have been disclosed net of unearned income. The following financial discussion should be read with the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements and Notes in this report. Additional information including the 2019 financial statements, notes, and MD&#38;A is provided in Item 7 and 8 to FHN&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. 

ADOPTION OF ACCOUNTING UPDATES 

Effective January 1, 2020 FHN adopted ASU 2016-13, "Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments," (CECL); which resulted in a $106.4 million increase to the allowance for loan losses ("ALLL") and a $24.0 million increase to the reserve for unfunded commitments, resulting in a $96.1 million decrease of retained earnings (net of taxes). See Note 1 &#8211; Financial Information for additional information. 

Non-GAAP Measures 

Certain measures are included in the narrative and tables in this MD&#38;A that are &#8220;non-GAAP&#8221;, meaning (under U.S. financial reporting rules) they are not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) in the U.S. and also are not codified in U.S. banking regulations currently applicable to FHN. 

&#160;

Although other entities may use calculation methods that differ from those used by FHN for non-GAAP measures, FHN&#8217;s management believes such measures are relevant to understanding the capital position or financial results of FHN. Non-GAAP measures are reported to FHN&#8217;s management and Board of Directors through various internal reports. 

Presentation of regulatory measures, even those which are not GAAP, provide a meaningful base for comparability to other financial institutions subject to the same regulations as FHN, as demonstrated by their use by banking regulators in reviewing capital adequacy of financial institutions. Although not GAAP terms, these regulatory measures are not considered &#8220;non-GAAP&#8221; under U.S. financial reporting rules as long as their presentation conforms to regulatory standards. 

Regulatory measures used in this MD&#38;A include: common equity tier 1 capital, generally defined as common equity less goodwill, other intangibles, and certain other required regulatory deductions; tier 1 capital, generally defined as the sum of core capital (including common equity and instruments that cannot be redeemed at the option of the holder) adjusted for certain items under risk based capital regulations; and risk-weighted assets (&#8220;RWA&#8221;), which is a measure of total on- and off-balance sheet assets adjusted for credit and market risk, used to determine regulatory capital ratios. 

The non-GAAP measure presented in this filing is return on average tangible common equity (&#8220;ROTCE&#8221;). Refer to table 23 for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP measure and presentation of the most comparable GAAP item.

Forward-Looking Statements 

This MD&#38;A contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 with respect to FHN&#8217;s beliefs, plans, goals, expectations, and estimates. Forward-looking statements are not a representation of historical information but instead pertain to future operations, strategies, financial results, or other developments. The words &#8220;believe,&#8221; &#8220;expect,&#8221; &#8220;anticipate,&#8221; &#8220;intend,&#8221; &#8220;estimate,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;is likely,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;going forward,&#8221; and other expressions that indicate future events and trends identify forward-looking statements. 

Forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business, operational, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond FHN&#8217;s control, and many of which, with respect to future business decisions and actions (including acquisitions and divestitures), are subject to change. Examples of uncertainties and contingencies include, among other important factors: general economic and financial market conditions, including expectations of and actual timing and amount of interest rate movements including the slope of the yield curve, competition, customer and investor responses to these conditions, ability to execute business plans, geopolitical developments, recent and future legislative and regulatory developments, natural disasters, the potential impacts on FHN&#8217;s businesses of the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic, including negative impacts from quarantines, market declines and volatility, and changes in customer behavior related to COVID-19, potential requirements for FHN to repurchase, or compensate for losses from, previously sold or securitized mortgages or securities based on such mortgages; potential claims alleging mortgage servicing failures, individually, on a class basis, or as master servicer of securitized loans; potential claims relating to participation in government programs, especially lending or other financial services programs; expectations of and actual timing and amount of interest rate movements, including the slope and shape of the yield curve, which can have a significant impact on a financial services institution; market and monetary fluctuations, including fluctuations in mortgage markets; inflation or deflation; customer, investor, competitor, regulatory, and legislative responses to any or all of these conditions; the financial condition of borrowers and other counterparties; competition within and outside the financial services industry; 

&#160;

geopolitical developments including possible terrorist activity; natural disasters; effectiveness and cost-efficiency of FHN&#8217;s hedging practices; technological changes; fraud, theft, or other incursions through conventional, electronic, or other means directly or indirectly affecting FHN or its customers, business counterparties or competitors; demand for FHN&#8217;s product offerings; new products and services in the industries in which FHN operates; the increasing use of new technologies to interact with customers and others; and critical accounting estimates. Other factors are those inherent in originating, selling, servicing, and holding loans and loan-based assets, including prepayment risks, pricing concessions, fluctuation in U.S. housing and other real estate prices, fluctuation of collateral values, and changes in customer profiles. Additionally, the actions of the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;), the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;), the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions ("TDFI") and its Commissioner, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (&#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221; or &#8220;Fed&#8221;), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&#8220;FINRA&#8221;), the U.S. Department of the Treasury (&#8220;U.S. Treasury&#8221;), the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (&#8220;MSRB&#8221;), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC"), the Financial Stability Oversight Council (&#8220;Council&#8221;), the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (&#8220;PCAOB&#8221;), and other regulators and agencies; pending, threatened, or possible future regulatory, administrative, and judicial outcomes, actions, and proceedings; current or future Executive orders; changes in laws and regulations applicable to FHN; and FHN&#8217;s success in executing its business plans and strategies and managing the risks involved in the foregoing, could cause actual results to differ, perhaps materially, from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. 

FHN assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements that are made in this Quarterly Report of which this MD&#38;A is a part or otherwise from time to time. Actual results could differ and expectations could change, possibly materially, because of one or more factors, including those presented in this Forward-Looking Statements section, in other sections of this MD&#38;A, in other parts of and exhibits to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2020 , and in documents incorporated into this Quarterly Report. 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 1Q20 FORM 10-Q REPORT 80 

Financial Summary 

As previously mentioned, effective January 1, 2020, FHN adopted ASU 2016-13, (CECL). Application of CECL methodology creates larger immediate impacts on credit loss estimates in unanticipated rapid declines in economic projections when compared to the prior incurred loss estimation methodology. The sudden, steep decline in the economic forecast associated with the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (&#8220;COVID-19&#8221;) pandemic late in first quarter 2020 resulted in a significant increase in loan loss provision expense and the reserve for unfunded commitments, negatively impacting FHN&#8217;s operating results in first quarter 2020. 

In first quarter 2020, FHN reported net income available to common shareholders of $12.1 million, or $.04 per diluted share, compared to net income available to common of $99.0 million, or $.31 per diluted share in first quarter 2019. The decline in results in first quarter 2020 relative to the prior year was driven by a significant increase in loan loss provision expense and an increase in the reserve for unfunded commitments, somewhat offset by higher revenue. 

Total revenue increased 10 percent to $477.6 million in first quarter 2020 from $435.6 million in first quarter 2019. NII increased to $302.8 million in first quarter 2020 from $294.5 million in first quarter 2019 primarily due to strong loan and deposit growth, favorable deposit costs, and the maturity of $400 million of senior debt in fourth quarter 2019. Lower loan yields compared to first quarter 2019 negatively impacted NII in first quarter 2020, offsetting a portion of the overall increase in NII. Noninterest income increased 24 percent, or $33.7 million, in first quarter 2020 driven by higher fixed income revenue, somewhat offset by a decrease in deferred compensation income relative to first quarter 2019. 

Noninterest expense increased 5 percent to $311.9 million in first quarter 2020 from $296.1 million in first quarter 2019. The expense increase in first quarter 2020, was due in large part to an increase in credit expense on unfunded 

&#160;

commitments associated with economic uncertainty attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as higher personnel-related expenses, somewhat offset by lower restructuring and rebranding related expenses. 

Asset quality trends in first quarter 2020 were relatively consistent with trends in first quarter 2019. The NPL ratio and 30+ delinquencies improved from .65 percent and .23 percent, respectively in first quarter 2019 to .57 percent and .19 percent, respectively in first quarter 2020. Net charge offs increased from .07 percent in first quarter 2019 to .10 percent in first quarter 2020 primarily driven by two credits. 

Return on average common equity (&#8220;ROCE&#8221;) and ROTCE were 1.05 percent and 1.59 percent, respectively, in first quarter 2020 compared to 9.09 percent and 14.17 percent, respectively, in first quarter 2019. Return on average assets (&#8220;ROA&#8221;) declined to .15 percent in first quarter 2020 from 1.03 percent in first quarter 2019. Key financial ratios were negatively impacted in first quarter 2020 by the large increase in loan loss provision expense. Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1, Total Capital, and Leverage ratios were 8.54 percent, 9.52 percent, 10.78 percent, and 9.00 percent, respectively, in first quarter 2020 down from 9.62 percent, 10.65 percent, 11.78 percent, and 9.02 percent, respectively, in first quarter 2019 driven by an increase in risk-weighted assets due to higher loan balances and an increase in fixed income market risk assets. Average assets increased to $43.6 billion in first quarter 2020 from $40.9 billion in first quarter 2019. Average loans and average deposits increased to $30.5 billion and $32.9 billion, respectively, in first quarter 2020, up 12 percent and 1 percent from first quarter 2019. Period-end Shareholders&#8217; equity increased to $5.1 billion in first quarter 2020 from $4.8 billion in first quarter 2019. Average Shareholders&#8217; equity increased to $5.0 billion in first quarter 2020 from $4.8 billion in first quarter 2019. 

Business Line Review 

Regional Banking 

Pre-tax income within the regional banking segment was $25.6 million in first quarter 2020, down from $147.0 million in first quarter 2019. The decrease in pre-tax income was primarily driven by an increase in loan loss provision expense, and higher credit expense on unfunded commitments somewhat offset by increase in revenue. 

Total revenue increased 6 percent to $382.0 million in first quarter 2020 from $359.1 million in first quarter 2019, driven by increases in NII and noninterest income. The 

&#160;

increase in NII was primarily due to strong loan and deposit growth and favorable deposit costs, which more than offset lower loan yields compared to first quarter 2019. Noninterest income increased 12 percent or $8.8 million to $81.9 million in first quarter 2020 from $73.0 million in the prior year. The increase in noninterest income was primarily driven by an increase in fees from derivative sales, higher brokerage, management fees and commissions, and an increase in other service charges revenue, partially offset by lower fees from deposit transactions and cash management activities relative to first quarter 2019. 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 1Q20 FORM 10-Q REPORT 81 

Provision expense increased to $145.4 million in first quarter 2020 from $13.4 million in first quarter 2019, primarily driven by the application of CECL methodology and a sudden, steep decline in the economic forecast attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Noninterest expense was $211.0 million in first quarter 2020, up from $198.6 million in first quarter 2019. The increase in expense was primarily driven by a $8.8 million increase in the credit expense on unfunded commitments largely associated with the application of CECL methodology with a sudden, steep decline in economic forecast attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. An increase in FDIC premium expense due to balance sheet growth and expected loss severity ratios as well as $1.0 million of additional credit risk adjustments related to Regional Banking interest rate derivatives and swap participations also contributed to the overall increase in expenses in first quarter 2020 compared to the prior year. 

Fixed Income 

Pre-tax income in the fixed income segment more than doubled to $25.6 million in first quarter 2020 from $10.6 million in first quarter 2019. The increase in pre-tax income in first quarter 2020 was driven by higher revenue, somewhat offset by an increase in expenses. 

Noninterest income increased 78 percent, or $41.9 million to $95.7 million in first quarter 2020 from $53.8 million in first quarter 2019. Average daily revenue (&#8220;ADR&#8221;) increased to $1.3 million in first quarter 2019 from $729 thousand in first quarter 2019, due to elevated levels of commissionable revenues, partially offset by elevated levels of trading losses driven by extreme market volatility as compared to first quarter 2019. Other product revenue was $17.4 million in first quarter 2020, up from $9.3 million in the prior year, primarily driven by increases in fees from derivative sales. NII was $10.9 million in first quarter 2020, up from $7.3 million in first quarter 2019, primarily due to higher spreads on inventory positions in addition to higher inventory balances compared to prior year. 

Noninterest expense was $81.1 million in first quarter 2020 compared to $50.5 million in first quarter 2019, primarily driven by higher variable compensation due to increased commissionable revenues. 

&#160;

Corporate 

The pre-tax loss for the corporate segment was $32.5 million in first quarter 2020 compared to $36.3 million in first quarter 2019. 

Net interest expense was $13.4 million and $7.9 million in first quarter 2020 and 2019, respectively. Net interest expense was negatively impacted by lower average balances of excess cash at the Federal reserve (&#8220;Fed&#8221;) and AFS securities, somewhat offset by the maturity of $400 million of senior debt in fourth quarter 2019. Noninterest income/(loss)(including securities gain/losses) in first quarter 2020 was negative $3.7 million compared to $13.4 million in first quarter 2019, primarily due to a $15.0 million decrease in deferred compensation income driven by negative equity market valuations relative to the prior year. 

Noninterest expense decreased 63 percent or $26.3 million from $41.8 million in first quarter 2019 to $15.5 million in first quarter 2020. The decrease in expense for first quarter 2020 was primarily driven by decreases in deferred compensation expense, restructuring costs associated with efficiency initiatives and rebranding expenses relative to first quarter 2019. This expense decrease was somewhat offset by an increase in pension expense. 

Non-Strategic 

The non-strategic segment had pre-tax income of $2.6 million in first quarter 2020 compared to $9.2 million in first quarter 2019. The decrease in results for first quarter 2020 was driven by a smaller provision credit and a decline in NII relative to first quarter 2019 somewhat offset by a decrease in expenses. 

Total revenue was $6.0 million in first quarter 2020 down from $9.9 million in first quarter 2019. NII decreased to $5.1 million in first quarter 2020 from $9.1 million in first quarter 2019, primarily due to continued run-off of the loan portfolios. Noninterest income was $.9 million in first quarter 2020 and 2019. 

The provision for loan losses within the non-strategic segment was a provision credit of $.4 million in first quarter 2020 compared to a provision credit of $4.4 million in the prior year. The reduction in provision credit in first quarter 2020 was due to additional consumer reserves associated with a sudden, steep decline in economic forecast attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Noninterest expense decreased 27 percent to $3.8 million in first quarter 2020 from $5.2 million in first quarter 2019. 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 1Q20 FORM 10-Q REPORT 82 

Income Statement Review 

Total consolidated revenue was $477.6 million in first quarter 2020, up 10 percent from $435.6 million in first quarter 2019 driven by a 24 percent increase in noninterest income and a 3 percent increase in NII. Provision expense increased significantly from $9.0 million in first quarter 2019 to $145.0 million in first quarter 2020 primarily driven by a sudden, steep decline in the economic forecast attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. Total consolidated expenses increased 5 percent to $311.3 million in first quarter 2020 from $296.1 million in first quarter 2019, driven by an increase in expense on unfunded commitments and higher personnel-related expenses, somewhat offset by lower restructuring and rebranding related expenses. 

Net Interest Income 

Net interest income was $302.8 million in first quarter 2020, up from $294.5 million in first quarter 2019. The increase in NII was primarily attributable to strong loan and deposit growth, favorable deposit costs, and the maturity of $400 million of senior debt in fourth quarter 2019, somewhat offset by lower loan yields compared to first quarter 2019. Average earning assets increased to $38.8 billion in first quarter 2020 from $36.3 billion in first quarter 2019. 

&#160;

The increase in average earning assets was primarily driven by increases in loans, securities purchased under agreement to resell ("asset repos"), and fixed income inventory, somewhat offset by decreases in interest-bearing cash. 

For purposes of computing yields and the net interest margin, FHN adjusts net interest income to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent pre-tax basis which provides comparability of net interest income arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. 

The consolidated net interest margin was 3.16 percent in first quarter 2020 down 15 basis points from 3.31 percent in first quarter 2019. The net interest spread was 2.89 percent in first quarter 2020, down 3 basis points from 2.92 percent in first quarter 2019. The decrease in NIM in first quarter 2020 was primarily the result of the negative impact of interest rates (including LIBOR and Prime) relative to first quarter 2019. Additionally, higher balances of trading securities negatively impacted NIM in first quarter 2020, but was somewhat mitigated by loan and deposit growth, lower balances of cash held at the Fed, and the maturity of $400 million of senior debt in fourth quarter 2019.

FHN&#8217;s net interest margin is primarily impacted by its balance sheet mix including the levels of fixed and floating rate loans, rate sensitive and non-rate sensitive liabilities, cash levels, trading inventory levels as well as loan fees and cash basis income. For 2020, NIM will also depend on potentially modest loan growth, rate impact from the elevated spread of LIBOR to Fed Funds, widening credit spreads, PPP fees, Fixed Income trading inventory and the extent of assets moving to nonaccrual status. 

PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES 

The provision for loan losses is the charge to earnings that management determines to be necessary to maintain the ALLL at a sufficient level reflecting management&#8217;s estimate of expected credit losses in the loan portfolio. Provision expense was $145.0 million in first quarter 2020 calculated under the CECL methodology adopted January 1, 2020, compared to $9.0 million in first quarter 2019 calculated under the &#8220;incurred loss&#8221; methodology. The increase in provision expense was primarily the result of a sudden, steep decline in the economic forecast attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, and to a much less extent associated with loan growth. For additional information about the provision for loan losses refer to the Regional Banking and Non-Strategic sections of the Business Line Review section in this MD&#38;A. For additional information about general asset quality trends refer to the Asset Quality section in this MD&#38;A.

NONINTEREST INCOME 

Noninterest income (including securities gains/(losses)) was $174.8 million in first quarter 2020 and represented 37 percent of total revenue compared to $141.0 million in first quarter 2019 and 32 percent. The increase in noninterest income in first quarter 2020 was primarily driven by higher fixed income revenue, somewhat offset by a decrease in deferred compensation income relative to first quarter 2019. 

Fixed Income Noninterest Income 

Fixed income noninterest income was $95.6 million in first quarter 2020, a 78 percent increase from $53.7 million in first quarter 2019. The increase in first quarter 2020 was largely driven by elevated levels of commissionable revenues, partially offset by elevated levels of trading losses driven by extreme market volatility in March 2020. Revenue from other products increased 86 percent to $17.3 million in first quarter 2020 from $9.3 million in first quarter 2019, primarily driven by increases in derivative sales.

Brokerage, Management Fees and Commissions 

Noninterest income from brokerage, management fees and commissions increased 22 percent or $2.8 million from $12.6 million in first quarter 2019 to $15.4 million in first quarter 2020. The increase in first quarter 2020 was primarily driven by higher advisory revenue and annuity income as a result of increased transaction volume. 

Deposit Transactions and Cash Management 

Fees from deposit transactions and cash management activities were $30.3 million in first quarter 2020, down 4 percent from $31.6 million in first quarter 2019. The decrease in first quarter 2020 is largely due to lower debit 

&#160;

card transaction fees as a result of volume incentives received in 2019 and lower NSF/overdraft fee income driven by changes in consumer behavior relative to first quarter 2019, somewhat offset by an increase in fees from cash management activities. 

Other Noninterest Income 

Other income includes revenues related to other service charges, ATM and interchange fees, mortgage banking (primarily within the non-strategic and regional banking segments), letters of credit fees, dividend income, electronic banking fees, insurance commissions, gain/(loss) 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 1Q20 FORM 10-Q REPORT 85 

on the extinguishment of debt, deferred compensation plans (which are mirrored by changes in noninterest expense) and various other fees. 

Revenue from all other income and commissions decreased to $14.4 million in first quarter 2020 from $24.6 million in first quarter 2019. The decrease in all other income and commissions in first quarter 2020 was largely due to a $15.0 million decrease in deferred compensation income driven by negative equity market valuations. Deferred compensation income fluctuates with changes in the market value of the underlying investments and is mirrored 

&#160;

by changes in deferred compensation expense which is included in personnel expense. An increase in other service charges and higher fees from derivative sales relative to first quarter 2019 offset a portion of the overall decline in other noninterest income.

(b) 

Amounts are driven by market conditions and are mirrored by changes in deferred compensation expense which is included in employee compensation expense. First quarter 2020 decrease was driven by negative equity market valuations. 

NONINTEREST EXPENSE 

Total noninterest expense increased to $311.3 million in first quarter 2020 from $296.1 million in first quarter 2019. The increase in noninterest expense in first quarter 2020 was primarily driven by an increase in credit expense on unfunded commitments associated with a sudden, steep decline in economic forecast attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

To a lesser extent, higher personnel-related expense also contributed to the increase in noninterest expense, somewhat offset by restructuring costs associated with the identification of efficiency opportunities within the organization, strategic initiatives and rebranding expenses recognized in first quarter 2019. 

&#160;

Employee Compensation, Incentives, and Benefits 

Employee compensation, incentives, and benefits (personnel expense), the largest component of noninterest expense, increased 3 percent in first quarter 2020 to $183.5 million from $177.9 million in first quarter 2019. The increase in personnel expense in first quarter 2020 was primarily driven by higher variable compensation due to increased commissionable revenues within Fixed Income. 

These expense increases were somewhat offset by a $16.6 million decrease in deferred compensation expense driven by negative equity market valuations in first quarter 2020 and a $6.4 million decrease in restructuring costs associated with the identification of efficiency opportunities within the organization. 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 1Q20 FORM 10-Q REPORT 86 

Professional Fees 

Professional fees decreased 43 percent or $5.3 million from $12.3 million in first quarter 2019 to $7.0 million in first quarter 2020. The decrease in professional fees was primarily driven by lower restructuring costs associated with the identification of efficiency opportunities within the organization. Additionally, strategic investments recognized in first quarter 2019 to analyze growth potential and product mix for new markets also contributed to the year-over-year decline in professional fees. 

FDIC premium expense 

FDIC premium expense increased 58 percent from $4.3 million in first quarter 2019 to $6.7 million in first quarter 2020 driven by balance sheet growth and expected loss severity ratios. 

Contract employment and outsourcing 

Expenses associated with contract employment and outsourcing increased 46 percent or $1.6 million to $4.9 million in first quarter 2020 compared to $3.4 million in first quarter 2019, primarily driven by merger and acquisition related projects. 

&#160;

Other Noninterest Expense 

Other expense includes expenses associated with unfunded commitments, travel and entertainment, other insurance and tax expenses, expenses associated with the non-service components of net periodic pension and post-retirement cost, supplies, customer relation expenses, costs associated with employee training and dues, miscellaneous loan costs, tax credit investments expenses, losses from litigation and regulatory matters, expenses associated with OREO, and various other expenses. 

All other expenses increased 72 percent to $33.2 million in first quarter 2020 from $19.3 million in first quarter 2019. The increase was primarily driven by an $8.8 million increase in credit expense on unfunded commitments largely associated with the application of CECL methodology with a sudden, steep decline in economic forecast attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, a $2.1 million increase in pension-related costs and $1.0 million of additional credit risk adjustments on Regional Banking interest rate derivatives and swap participations also contributed to the overall increase in all other expenses in first quarter 2020 related to prior year.

INCOME TAXES 

&#160;

F HN recorded an income tax provision of $4.8 million in first quarter 2020 , compared to $27.1 million in first 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 1Q20 FORM 10-Q REPORT 87 

quarter 2019 . The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2020 was approximately 22 percent compared to 21 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2019 . 

The Company&#8217;s effective tax rate is favorably affected by recurring items such as bank-owned life insurance, tax-exempt income, and credits and other tax benefits from affordable housing investments. The effective rate is unfavorably affected by the non-deductibility of a portion of the Company's FDIC premium and executive compensation expenses. The Company&#8217;s effective tax rate also may be affected by items that may occur in any given period but are not consistent from period to period, such as changes in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance and changes in unrecognized tax benefits. 

A deferred tax asset (&#8220;DTA&#8221;) or deferred tax liability (&#8220;DTL&#8221;) is recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities. The tax consequence is calculated by applying enacted statutory tax rates, applicable to future years, to these temporary differences. As of March 31, 2020 , FHN&#8217;s gross DTA (net of a valuation allowance) and gross DTL were $292.8 million and $207.6 million, respectively, resulting in a net DTA of $85.2 million at March 31, 2020 , compared with a net DTA of $69.0 million at December 31, 2019. 

&#160;

As of March 31, 2020 , FHN had deferred tax asset balances related to federal and state income tax carryforwards of $37.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively, which will expire at various dates. 

FHN believes that it will be able to realize the value of its DTA and that no valuation allowance is needed. FHN monitors its DTA and the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. 

RESTRUCTURING, REPOSITIONING, AND EFFICIENCY INITIATIVES 

Beginning in 2019, FHN initiated a company-wide review of business practices with the goal of optimizing its expense base to improve profitability and create capacity to reinvest savings into technology and revenue production activities. The net charges for restructuring, repositioning, and efficiency initiatives were immaterial in first quarter 2020 compared to $12.2 million in first quarter 2019. These expenses are primarily associated with severance and other employee costs and professional fees. Due to the broad nature of the actions being taken, many components of expense are expected to benefit from the current efficiency initiatives. See Note 17 - Restructuring, Repositioning, and Efficiency for additional information. 

Statement of Condition Review 

Total period-end assets were $47.2 billion on March 31, 2020 , up 9 percent from $43.3 billion on December 31, 2019. The increase in period-end assets was primarily driven by strong loan growth. Additionally, a net increase in other earning assets (primarily trading securities), derivative assets and FHLB stock also contributed to the increase in period-end assets. These increases were somewhat offset by an increase in the allowance for loan losses due to the Adoption of ASU 2016-13, &#8220;Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,&#8221; or (&#8220;CECL&#8221;) and all related ASUs on January 1, 2020 and additional reserves recognized in first quarter 2020 due to a sudden, steep decline in the economic forecast attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. Average assets increased 2 percent to $43.6 billion in first quarter 2020 from $42.9 billion in fourth quarter 2019. The increase in average assets was driven by higher balances of trading securities and securities purchased under agreements to resell (&#8220;asset repos&#8221;), somewhat offset by lower average loan balances and an increase in the ALLL due to the adoption of CECL. 

Total period-end liabilities were $42.1 billion on March 31, 2020 , a 10 percent increase from $38.2 billion on December 31, 2019. The net increase in period-end liabilities was primarily due to increases in deposits and 

&#160;

higher balances of short-term borrowings. In first quarter 2020, average liabilities increased to $38.5 billion from $37.8 billion in fourth quarter 2019. The increase in 

average liabilities was largely driven by higher balances of short-term borrowings somewhat offset by a decrease in federal funds purchased (&#8220;FFP&#8221;) relative to fourth quarter 2019. 

EARNING ASSETS 

Earning assets consist of loans, investment securities, loans HFS, and other earning assets such as trading securities and interest-bearing cash. Average earning assets increased 1 percent and 7 percent to $38.8 billion in first quarter 2020 from $38.2 billion and $36.3 billion, respectively, in fourth quarter 2019 and first quarter 2019. A more detailed discussion of the major line items follows. 

Loans 

Period-end loans increased 7 percent and 19 percent to $33.4 billion as of March 31, 2020 from $31.1 billion on December 31, 2019 and $28.0 billion as of March 31, 2019 . The increase is period-end loan balances compared to December 31, 2019 was primarily due to an increase in 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 1Q20 FORM 10-Q REPORT 88 

loans to mortgage companies during the end of March and additional commercial line draws. Average loans for first quarter 2020 were $30.5 billion compared to $30.7 billion 

&#160;

in fourth quarter 2019 and $27.3 billion in first quarter 2019.

In first quarter 2020, the Permanent Mortgage portfolio was combined into Consumer Real Estate portfolio, all prior periods were revised for comparability. 

C&#38;I loans are the largest component of the loan portfolio comprising 64 percent of total loans in both first quarter 2020 and fourth quarter 2019. C&#38;I loans declined 1 percent, from fourth quarter 2019 largely driven by lower balances within mortgage warehouse lending, partially mitigated by strong loan growth within other commercial portfolios of Regional Banking. Growth in other specialty lending areas, such as franchise finance, private client, asset based lending, and healthcare also offset a portion of the overall decline in average C&#38;I loans in first quarter 2020 compared to fourth quarter 2019.Commercial real estate loans experienced a net increase of 4 percent to $4.4 billion in first quarter 2020. 

Average consumer loans declined 1 percent from fourth quarter 2019 to $6.6 billion in first quarter 2020, largely driven by the continued wind-down of portfolios within the Non-strategic segment and declines in home equity lines of credit within the Regional Banking segment. 

Investment Securities 

FHN&#8217;s investment portfolio consists principally of debt securities including government agency issued mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;MBS&#8221;) and government agency issued collateralized mortgage obligations (&#8220;CMO&#8221;), substantially all of which are classified as available-for-sale (&#8220;AFS&#8221;). FHN utilizes the securities portfolio as a source of income, liquidity and collateral for repurchase agreements, for public funds, and as a tool for managing risk of interest rate movements. Period-end investment securities we re $4.6 billi on on March 31, 2020 compared to $4.5 billion on December 31, 2019. 

Average investment securities were $4.5 billi on in first quarter 2020 and $4.4 billion in fourth quarter 2019, representing 12 percent of average earning assets in first quarter 2020 and fourth quarter 2019. The increase in period-end and average investment securities was driven by FHN's reinvestment strategy in 2020. FHN manages the size and mix of the investment portfolio to assist in asset 

&#160;

liability management, provide liquidity, and optimize risk adjusted returns. 

Loans Held-for-Sale 

Loans HFS consists of small business, other consumer loans, the mortgage warehouse, USDA, student, and home equity loans. On March 31, 2020 , loans H FS were $595.6 million and $593.8 million, respectively. The average balance of loans HFS increased to $590.5 million in first quarter 2020 from $581.8 million in fourth quarter 2019. The increase in period-end and average loans HFS was primarily driven by an increase in small business loans, somewhat offset by a decrease in USDA loans. 

Other Earning Assets 

Other earning assets include trading securities, securities purchased under agreements to resell ("asset repos"), federal funds sold (&#8220;FFS&#8221;), and interest-bearing deposits with the Fed and other financial institutions. Other earning a ssets averaged $3.2 billion in first quarter 2020, a 28 percent increase from $2.5 billion in fourth quarter 2019. The increase in average other earning assets was primarily driven by increases in fixed income trading inventory and asset repos relative to fourth quarter 2019. Fixed income's trading inventory fluctuates daily based on customer demand. Asset repos are used in fixed income trading activity and generally fluctuate with the level of fixed income trading liabilities (short-positions) as securities collateral from asset repo transactions are used to fulfill trades. Other earning assets were $3.1 billion on March 31, 2020 , up from $2.5 billion on December 31, 2019, primarily driven by increases in fixed income trading inventory and interest-bearing cash.

Non-earning assets 

Period-end non-earning assets were $5.5 billion and $4.7 billion on March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, driven largely by increases in derivative assets, equity investments (primarily FHLB stock), and fixed income receivables, partially offset by an increase in the ALLL and a decrease in cash balances. Derivative assets and fixed income receivable balances were higher as a result of extreme market volatility during first quarter 2020 and an increase in required margin posting. The increase in the ALLL was due to the adoption of ASU 2016-13 (CECL) on January 1, 2020 and additional reserves established during first quarter 2020 associated with a sudden, steep decline in the economic forecast attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Deposits 

Average deposits increased to $32.9 billion during first quarter 2020 from $32.8 billion in fourth quarter 2019 and $32.5 billion in first quarter 2019. The increase in average deposits from fourth quarter 2019 was driven by a seasonal influx of consumer deposits (both non-interest bearing and interest bearing), coupled with an increase in market-indexed deposits, partially offset by lower commercial interest deposits. The increase in first quarter 2020 relative to first quarter 2019 was driven by increases in non-interest 

&#160;

bearing and consumer interest deposits as a result of FHN&#8217;s strategic focus on growing deposits during 2019, partially offset by decreases in commercial interest and market-indexed deposits. FHN's mix of interest-bearing deposits and noninterest-bearing deposits remained relatively consistent between periods. 

Period-end deposits increased 6 percent to $34.4 billion on March 31, 2020, from $32.4 billion on December 31, 2019 and $32.5 billion on March 31, 2019. The increase in deposits from December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2019 was largely the result of management&#8217;s decision to increase market-indexed deposits (given the favorable benefits of this funding source in lower interest-rate environments) to fund loan growth, as well as significant deposit inflows in March 2020 as brokerage customers exited equity markets to move in cash positions given the market volatility associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Th e following table summarizes FHN's average deposits for quarters-ended March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.

Short-Term Borrowings 

Short-term borrowings (federal funds purchased (&#8220;FFP&#8221;), securities sold under agreements to repurchase, trading liabilities, and other short-term borrowings) averaged $4.0 billion in first quarter 2020, up 20 percent from $3.3 billion in fourth quarter 2019. As noted in the table below, the increase in short-term borrowings between first quarter 2020 and fourth quarter 2019 was primarily driven by increases in other short-term borrowings and trading liabilities, partially offset by a decrease in FFP. Other short-term borrowings balances fluctuate largely based on 

&#160;

the level of FHLB borrowing as a result of loan demand, deposit levels and balance sheet funding strategies. Trading liabilities fluctuates based on expectations of customer demand. FFP fluctuates depending on the amount of excess funding of FHN&#8217;s correspondent bank customers. Period-end short-term borrowings increased 44 percent to $5.8 billion on March 31, 2020 from $4.0 billion on December 31, 2019, primarily driven by an increase in other short-term borrowings, somewhat offset by a decreases in FFP. The increase in short-term borrowings was used to fund commercial loan growth including an uptick in loans to mortgage companies in the latter part of the quarter.

Term Borrowings 

Term borrowings include senior and subordinated borrowings with original maturities greater than one year. Average term borrowings were $.8 billion in first quarter 2020 and $.9 billion in fourth quarter 2019. Period-end term borrowings we re $.8 billion on March 31 , 2020 and December 31, 2019. In April 2020, First Horizon Bank issued $450 million of subordinated notes. 

&#160;

Other Liabilities 

Period-end other liabil ities were $1.2 billion on March 31 , 2020, up from $1.0 billion on December 31, 2019, primarily driven by increases in derivative liabilities and fixed income payables. 

Capital 

Management&#8217;s objectives are to provide capital sufficient to cover the risks inherent in FHN&#8217;s businesses, to maintain excess capital to well-capitalized standards, and to assure ready access to the capital markets. Period-end equity decreased $20.4 million from $5.1 billion on December 31, 2019 to $5.1 billion on March 31, 2020. Average equity decreased $37.5 million to $5.0 billion in first quarter 2020 from $5.0 billion in fourth quarter 2019. The decrease in period-end and average equity was largely attributable to the adoption impact of ASU 2016-13 (CECL) which 

&#160;

resulted in a net decrease to retained earnings of $96.1 million on January 1, 2020, coupled with common and preferred dividends paid, somewhat offset by net income recognized since fourth quarter 2019. A decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI"), largely the result of an increase in unrealized gains associated with AFS debt securities partially mitigated the decrease in period-end and average equity.

(a) 

The modified CECL transitional amount is calculated as defined in the CECL interim final rule issued by the banking regulators on March 27, 2020 and includes the full amount of the impact to retained earnings from the initial adoption of CECL plus 25 percent of the change in the adjusted allowance for credit losses (&#8220;AACL&#8221;) since FHN&#8217;s initial adoption of CECL through March 31, 2020. 

Banking regulators define minimum capital ratios for bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries. Based on the capital rules and definitions prescribed by the banking regulators, should any depository institution&#8217;s capital ratios decline below predetermined levels, it would become subject to a series of increasingly restrictive regulatory actions. The system categorizes a depository institution&#8217;s 

&#160;

capital position into one of five categories ranging from well-capitalized to critically under-capitalized. For an 

institution the size of FHN to qualify as well-capitalized, Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 Capital, Total Capital, and Leverage capital ratios must be at least 6.5 percent, 8 percent, 10 percent, and 5 percent, respectively. Furthermore, beginning January 1, 2019, a capital conservation buffer of 50 basis points above these levels 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 1Q20 FORM 10-Q REPORT 92 

must be maintained on the Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios to avoid restrictions on dividends, share repurchases and certain discretionary bonuses. 

As of March 31, 2020 , each of FHN and First Horizon Bank had sufficient capital to qualify as well-capitalized institutions. FHN also had sufficient capital to meet the capital conservation buffer requirement while First Horizon Bank fell slightly below based on its Total Capital Ratio. (See discussion on dividend limitations for First Horizon Bank in the &#8220;Liquidity Risk Management&#8221; section of this MD&#38;A.) In April 2020, First Horizon Bank generated additional Tier 2 capital through the issuance of $450 million of subordinated notes. The first quarter 2020 capital ratios for both FHN and First Horizon Bank are calculated under the interim final rule issued by the banking regulators in late March 2020 to delay the effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year transition period. For both FHN and First Horizon Bank, the risk-based regulatory capital ratios decreased in first quarter 2020 relative to fourth quarter 2019 primarily due to increased risk-weighted assets due to period-end commercial loan growth (primarily loans to mortgage companies) and higher draw activity in March, coupled with an increase in market risk assets driven by a spike in VaR due to extreme volatility in March. During 2020, capital ratios are expected to remain above well-capitalized standards. 

&#160;

Common Stock Purchase Programs 

Pursuant to board authority, FHN may repurchase shares of its common stock from time to time and will evaluate the level of capital and take action designed to generate or use capital, as appropriate, for the interests of the shareholders, subject to legal and regulatory restrictions. Two common stock purchase programs currently authorized are discussed below. FHN&#8217;s board has not authorized a preferred stock purchase program. 

General Authority 

On January 23, 2018, FHN announced a $250 million share purchase authority with an expiration date of January 31, 2020. On January 29, 2019, FHN announced a $250 million increase in that authority along with an extension of the expiration date to January 31, 2021. Purchases may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and are subject to market conditions, accumulation of excess equity, prudent capital management, and legal and regulatory restrictions. As of March 31, 2020, $229.3 million in purchases had been made under this authority at an average price per share of $15.09, $15.07 excluding commissions. Management currently does not anticipate purchasing a material number of shares under this authority during the first half of 2020 due to the pending merger of equals with IBKC.

Compensation Authority 

A consolidated compensation plan share purchase program was announced on August 6, 2004. This program consolidated into a single share purchase program all of the previously authorized compensation plan share programs as well as the renewal of the authorization to purchase shares for use in connection with two compensation plans for which the share purchase authority had expired. 

&#160;

The total amount authorized under this consolidated compensation plan share purchase program, inclusive of a program amendment on April 24, 2006, is 29.6 million shares calculated before adjusting for stock dividends distributed through January 1, 2011. The authorization has been reduced for that portion which relates to compensation plans for which no options remain outstanding. The shares may be purchased over the option exercise period of the various compensation plans on or before December 31, 2023. Purchases may be made in the 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 1Q20 FORM 10-Q REPORT 93 

open market or through privately negotiated transactions and are subject to market conditions, accumulation of excess equity, prudent capital management, and legal and regulatory restrictions. As of March 31, 2020, the 

&#160;

maximum number of shares that may be purchased under the program was 24.3 million shares. Management currently does not anticipate purchasing a material number of shares under this authority during 2020.

Asset Quality 

Loan Portfolio Composition 

FHN groups its loans into portfolio segments based on internal classifications reflecting the manner in which the ALLL is established and how credit risk is measured, monitored, and reported. From time to time, and if conditions are such that certain subsegments are uniquely affected by economic or market conditions or are experiencing greater deterioration than other components of the loan portfolio, management may determine the ALLL at a more granular level. Commercial loans are composed of commercial, financial, and industrial (&#8220;C&#38;I&#8221;) and commercial real estate (&#8220;CRE&#8221;). Consumer loans are composed of consumer real estate; and credit card and other. In first quarter 2020, FHN consolidated its permanent mortgage portfolio into consumer real estate. Loans previously classified in permanent mortgage included p rimarily jumbo mortgages and one-time-close (&#8220;OTC&#8221;) completed construction loans in the non-strategic segment that were originated through pre-2009 mortgage businesses. FHN has a concentration of residential real estate loans (19 percent of total loans). Industry concentrations are discussed under the heading C&#38;I below. 

Consolidated key asset quality metrics for each of these portfolios can be fou nd in Table 17 &#8211; Asset Q uality by Portfolio. Credit underwriting guidelines are outlined in Exhibit 13 to FHN&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, in the Loan Portfolio Composition discussion in the Asset Quality Section 

&#160;

beginning on page 67 and continuing to page 87. FHN&#8217;s credit underwriting guidelines and loan product offerings as of March 31, 2020 , are generally consistent with those reported and disclosed in the Company&#8217;s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. 

COMMERCIAL LOAN PORTFOLIOS 

C&#38;I 

The C&#38;I portfolio was $22.1 billion on March 31, 2020 , and is comprised of loans used for general business purposes. Typical products include working capital lines of credit, term loan financing of owner-occupied real estate and fixed assets, and trade credit enhancement through letters of cr edit. The largest geographical concentrations of balances as of March 31, 2020, are in Tennessee (29 percent), North Carolina (10 percent), California (9 percent), Texas (6 percent), Florida (6 percent), Georgia (4 percent), South Carolina (3 percent), and Virginia (3 percent), with no other state representing more than 3 percent of the portfolio. 

The following table provides the composition of the C&#38;I portfolio by industry as of March 31, 2020 , and December 31, 2019. For purposes of this disclosure, industries are determined based on the North American Industry Classification System (&#8220;NAICS&#8221;) industry codes used by Federal statistical agencies in classifying business establishments for the collection, analysis, and publication of statistical data related to the U.S. business economy.

Industry Concentrations 

Loan concentrations are considered to exist for a financial institution when there are loans to numerous borrowers engaged in similar activities that would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditi ons. 39 percent of FHN&#8217;s C&#38;I portfolio (Finance and insurance plus Loans to mortgage companies) could be affected by items that uniquely impact the financial services in dustry. Except &#8220;Finance and Insurance&#8221; and &#8220;Loans to Mortgage Companies&#8221;, as discussed below, on March 31, 2020 , FHN did not have any other concentrations of C&#38;I loans in any single industry of 10 percent or more of total loans. 

Loans to Mortgage Companies 

The balance of loans to mortgage companie s was 26 perc ent of the C&#38;I portfolio as of March 31, 2020 , 2 2 percent as of December 31, 2019 and 13 percent as of March 31, 2019 , and includes balances related to both home purchase and refinance activity. This portfolio class, which generally fluctuates with mortgage rates and seasonal factors, includes commercial lines of credit to qualified mortgage companies primarily for the temporary warehousing of eligible mortgage loans prior to the borrower&#8217;s sale of those mortgage loans to third party investors. Generally, lending to mortgage lenders increases when there is a decline in mortgage rates and decreases when rates rise. In periods of economic uncertainty, this trend may not occur even if interest rates are declining. In first quarter 2020, 46 percent of the loans funded were home purchases and 54 percent were refinance transactio ns. 

Finance and Insurance 

The finance and insurance component represent s 13 p ercent of the C&#38;I portfolio as of March 31, 2020 compared to 14 percent as of December 31, 2019, and includes TRUPS (i.e., long-term unsecured loans to bank 

&#160;

and insurance-related businesses), loans to bank holding companies, and asset-based lending to consumer finance companies. As of March 31, 2020 , asset-based lending to consumer finance companies represents ap proximately $1.2 billion o f the finance and insurance component. 

TRUPS lending was originally extended as a form of &#8220;bridge&#8221; financing to participants in the pooled trust preferred securitization program offered primarily to smaller banking (generally less than $15 billion in total assets) and insurance institutions through FHN&#8217;s fixed income business. Origination of TRUPS lending ceased in early 2008. Individual TRUPS are re-graded at least quarterly as part of FHN&#8217;s commercial loan review process. The terms of these loans generally include a scheduled 30 year balloon payoff and include an option to defer interest for up to 20 consecutive quarters. As of March 31, 2020 , no TRUP relationship was on interest deferral. 

As of March 31, 2020 , the unpaid principal balance (&#8220;UPB&#8221;) of trust preferred loans totaled $234.2 million ($173.6 million of bank TRUPS and $60.7 million of insurance TRUPS) with the UPB of other bank-related loans totaling $282.3 million. Inclusive of a valuation allowance on TRUPS of $18.9 million, total reserves (ALLL plus the valuation allowance) for TRUPS and other bank-related loans were $29.9 million or 6 percent of outstanding UPB. 

C&#38;I Asset Quality Trends 

The C&#38;I portfolio trends remained stable in first quarter 2020; however, the impact of economic uncertainty attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic could negatively impact future trends. The C&#38;I ALLL increased $132.0 million from December 31, 2019, to $254.5 million as of March 31, 2020 , primarily due to the sudden, steep decline 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 1Q20 FORM 10-Q REPORT 95 

in the economic forecast attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic and the adoption of ASU 2016-13. 

The allowance as a percentage of period-end loans increased 54 basis points to 1.15 percent as of March 31, 2020 , compared to .61 percent as of year-end 2019. Nonperforming C&#38;I loans increased $21.8 million from December 31, 2019, to $96.1 million on March 31, 2020 . The nonperforming loan (&#8220;NPL&#8221;) ratio increased to .43 percent of C&#38;I loans as of March 31, 2020 , from .37 percent as of December 31, 2019. The increase in NPLs was primarily driven by one credit. 

&#160;

The 30+ delinquenc y ratio increased 3 basis points to .08 percent as of March 31, 2020 . First quarter 2020 experienced net charge-offs of $5.8 million compared to $3.3 million and $2.3 million of net charge-offs in fourth quarter 2019 and first quarter 2019, respectively. First quarter 2020 net charge-offs were primarily driven by one credit.

Commercial Real Estate 

The CRE portfolio was $4.6 billion on March 31, 2020 . The CRE portfolio includes both financings for commercial construction and nonconstruction loans. The largest geographical concentrations of balances as of March 31, 2020 are in North Carolina (28 percent), Tennessee (20 percent), Florida (13 percent), South Carolina (8 percent), Texas (8 percent), Georgia (6 percent), and Kentucky (3 percent), with no other state representing more than 3 percent of the portfolio. This portfolio is segregated between the income-producing CRE class which contains loans, draws on lines and letters of credit to commercial real estate developers for the construction and mini-permanent financing of income-producing real estate, and the residential CRE class. Subcategories of income CRE consist of office (27 percent), multi-family (22 percent), retail (19 percent), industrial (13 percent), hospitality (12 percent), land/land development (1 percent), and other (6 percent). 

The residential CRE class includes loans to residential builders and developers for the purpose of constructing single-family homes, condominiums, and town homes, and on a limited basis, for develo ping residential subdivisions. After the fulfillment of existing commitments over the near term, the residential CRE class will be in a wind-down state with the expectation of full runoff in the foreseeable future. 

&#160;

CRE Asset Quality Trends 

The CRE portfolio as of March 31, 2020 was not significantly affected by the global COVID-19 pandemic, with nonperforming loans up $.4 million fro m December 31, 2019. However, economic uncertainty attributable to COVID-19 could impact future CRE portfolio trends. The allowance increased to $47.6 million as of March 31, 2020 , from $36.1 million as of December 31, 2019 primarily due to COVID-19. Allowance as a percentage of loans increased 20 basis points from .83 percent as of December 31, 2019, to 1.03 percent as of March 31, 2020 . Nonperforming loans as a percentage of total CRE loans increased 1 basis point from December 31, 2019, to .05 percent as of March 31, 2020 . 

Accruing delinquencies as a percentage of period-end loans decreased to .01 percent as of March 31, 2020 , from .02 percent as of December 31, 2019. Net charge-offs were not significant in first quarter 2020 and were $377 thousand in first quarter 2019.

CONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIOS 

Consumer Real Estate 

The consumer real estate portfolio was $6.1 billion on March 31, 2020 , and is primarily composed of home equity lines and installment loans including restricted balances (loans consolidated under ASC 810). The largest geographical concentrations of balances as of March 31, 2020 , are i n Tennessee (55 percent), North Carolina (15 percent), Florida (14 percent), and California (3 percent), with no other state represen ting more than 3 percent of the portfoli o. As of March 31, 2020 , approximately 85 p ercent of the consumer real estate portfolio was in a first lien position. At origination, weighted average FICO score of this portfolio was 755 and refreshed FICO scores averaged 754 on March 31, 2020 . Generally, perform ance of this portfolio is affected by life events that affect borrowers&#8217; finances, the level of unemployment, and home prices. 

Home equity lines of credit (&#8220;HELOCs&#8221;) comprise $1.3 billion of the consumer real estate portfolio as of March 31, 2020 . FHN&#8217;s HELOCs typically have a 5 or 10 year draw period followed by a 10 or 20 year repayment period, respectively. During the draw period, a borrower is able to draw on the line and is only required to make interest payments. The line is automatically frozen if a borrower becomes 45 days or more past due on payments. Once the draw period has concluded, the line is closed and the borrower is required to make both principal and interest 

&#160;

payments monthly until the loan matures. The principal payment generally is fully amortizing, but payment amounts will adjust when variable rates reset to reflect changes in the prime rate. 

As of March 31, 2020 , approximately 78 pe rcent of FHN's HELOCs are in the draw period compared to approximately 76 percent as of December 31, 2019. Based on when draw periods are scheduled to end per the line agreement, it is expected that $306.7 million, or 32 percent o f HELOCs currently in the draw period, will enter the repayment period during the next 60 months. Delinquencies and charge-off rates for HELOCs that have entered the repayment period are initially higher than HELOCs still in the draw period because of the increased minimum payment requirement; however, after some seasoning, performance of these loans usually begins to stabilize. The home equity lines of the consumer real estate portfolio are being monitored closely for those nearing the end of the draw period and borrowers are initially being contacted at least 24 months before the repayment period begins to remind the customer of the terms of their agreement and to inform them of options. 

The following table shows the HELOCs currently in the draw period and expected timing of conversion to the repayment period.

C onsumer Real Estate Asset Quality Trends 

Overall, performance of the consumer real estate portfolio remained stable in first quarter 2020. Economic uncertainty attributable to COVID-19 could impact future trends. The non-strategic segment is a run-off portfolio and while the absolute dollars of delinquencies and nonaccruals as well as the 30+ accruing delinquencies ratio improved from year-end, nonperforming loans ratios deteriorated. That trend of increasing deterioration of ratios in the non-strategic 

&#160;

segment is likely to continue and may become more skewed as the portfolio shrinks and some of the stronger borrowers payoff or refinance elsewhere. NPLs as a percentage of loans increased 10 basis point from year-end to 1.49 percent as of March 31, 2020 . The ALLL increased $94.6 million from December 31, 2019, to $123.0 million as of March 31, 2020 , primarily due to the adoption of ASU 2016-13. The allowance as a percentage of loans increased 155 basis points to 2.01 percent as of March 31, 2020 , compared to year-end. The balance of nonperforming loans increased $5.5 million to $91.2 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 1Q20 FORM 10-Q REPORT 99 

million as of March 31, 2020 . Loans delinquent 30 or more days and still accruing declined from $42.9 million as of December 31, 2019, to $40.1 million as of March 31, 2020 . The portfolio realized net recoveries of $1.2 million in first quarter 2020 compared to net recoveries of $3.3 million in 

&#160;

fourth quarter 2019 and net recoveries of $1.2 million in first quarter 2019.

Credit Card and Other 

The credit card and other portfolio, which is primarily within the regional banking segment, was $.5 billion as of March 31, 2020 , and primarily includes credit card receivables, other consumer-related credits, and automobile loans. The allowance increased to $19.3 million as of March 31, 2020 , from $13.3 million as December 31, 2019, primarily driven by the sudden, steep decline in the 

&#160;

economic forecast attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic and the adoption of ASU 2016-13. Loans 30 days or more delinquent and accruing as a percentage of loans increased 6 basis points from December 31, 2019, to .99 percent as of March 31, 2020 . Net charge-offs were $2.6 million in first quarter 2020 compared to $3.1 million in first quarter 2019.

Allowance for Loan Losses 

Management&#8217;s policy is to maintain the ALLL at a level sufficient to recognize current expected credit losses on the amortized cost basis of the loan portfolio. The total allowance for loan losses increased to $444.5 million on March 31, 2020 , from $200.3 million on December 31, 2019. The ALLL as of March 31, 2020 , reflects the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020 and the sudden, steep decline in the economic forecast attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. The ratio of allowance for credit losses to total loans, net of unearned income, increase 69 basis points to 1.33 percent on March 31, 2020 , compared to .64 percent on December 31, 2019. 

The provision for loan losses is the charge to or release of earnings necessary to maintain the ALLL at a sufficient level reflecting management&#8217;s estimate of current expected losses on the amortized cost basis of the loan portfolio. Provision expense was $145.0 million in first quarter 2020, compared to $9.0 million provision expense in first quarter 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to the declining economic forecast attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

FHN expects asset quality trends to be impacted by the economic uncertainty attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. The C&#38;I portfolio reflects a broad mix of categories with the heaviest concentration in loans to mortgage companies which carry minimal credit risk. The CRE portfolio metrics could be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic due to travel and occupancy restrictions set by state and local governments affecting CRE- Hospitality and CRE-Retail. The consumer portfolio could be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic if consumer unemployment continues to rise and customers are unable to continue making loan payments. The consumer portfolio however is high quality with no subprime and minimal exposure to high risk lending. The remaining non-strategic consumer real estate should continue to steadily wind down; however, it could be impacted if unemployment continues to rise and borrowers have difficulty making loan payments. Asset quality metrics within non-strategic have become skewed as the portfolio continues to shrink. 

Consolidated Net Charge-offs 

In first quarter 2020, FHN experienced net charge-offs of $7.2 million compared to $4.5 million of net charge-offs in first quarter 2019. 

The commercial portfolio experienced $5.8 million of net charge-offs in first quarter 2020 compared to $2.6 million in net charge-offs in first quarter 2019. In addition, the consumer real estate portfolio experienced net recoveries of $1.2 million in both first quarter 2020 and first quarter 2019. Credit card and other consumer experienced net charge-offs of $2.6 million in first quarter 2020 compared to $3.1 million a year ago. 

&#160;

Nonperforming Assets 

Nonperforming loans are loans placed on nonaccrual if it becomes evident that full collection of principal and interest is at risk, impairment has been recognized as a partial charge-off of principal balance due to insufficient collateral value and past due status, or on a case-by-case basis if FHN continues to receive payments but there are other borrower-specific issues. Included in nonaccruals are loans in which FHN continues to receive payments including residential real estate loans where the borrower has been discharged of personal obligation through bankruptcy, and second liens, regardless of delinquency status, behind first liens that are 90 or more days past due, are bankruptcies, or are TDRs. These, along with OREO, excluding OREO from government insured mortgages, represent nonperforming assets (&#8220;NPAs&#8221;). 

Total nonperforming assets (including NPLs HFS) increased to $207.3 million on March 31, 2020 , from $181.9 million on December 31, 2019. The nonperforming assets ratio (nonperforming assets excluding NPLs HFS to total period-end loans plus OREO and other assets) increased to .61 percent as of March 31, 2020 , from .57 percent as of December 31, 2019. Portfolio nonperforming loans increased to $189.8 million as of March 31, 2020 , from $162.2 million as of December 31, 2019. The increase in nonperforming loans was driven by the C&#38;I portfolio. 

The ratio of the ALLL to NPLs in the loan portfolio was 2.34 times as of March 31, 2020 , compared to 1.24 times as of December 31, 2019. Certain nonperforming loans in both the commercial and consumer portfolios are deemed collateral-dependent and are charged down to an estimate of collateral value less costs to sell. Because loss content has been recognized through a partial charge-off, typically reserves are not recorded. 

Table 19 provides an activity rollforward of OREO balances for March 31, 2020 and 2019. The balance of OREO, exclusive of inventory from government insured mortgages, decreased to $13.9 million as of March 31, 2020 , f rom $20.7 millio n as of March 31, 2019 , driven by the sale of OREO. Moreover, property values have stabilized which also affects the balance of OREO.

Past Due Loans and Potential Problem Assets 

Past due loans are loans co ntractually past due as to interest or principal payments, but which have not yet been put on nonaccrual status. Loans in the portfolio that are 90 days or more past due and still accruing were $14.1 million on March 31, 2020 , compared to $21.9 million on December 31, 2019. Loans 30 to 89 days past due were $48.5 million on March 31, 2020 , compared to $36.1 million on December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily driven by the C&#38;I portfolio. 

Potential problem assets represent those assets where information about possible credit problems of borrowers has caused management to have serious doubts about the borrower&#8217;s ability to comply with present repayment terms and includes loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing. This definition is believed to be substantially consistent with the standards established by Federal banking regulators for loans classified as substandard. Potential problem assets in the loan po rtfolio were $411.1 million on March 31, 2020 , $346.9 million on December 31, 2019, and $270.4 million on March 31, 2019 . The increase in potential problem assets compared to December 31, 2019 was due to net increase in classified commercial loans within the C&#38;I portfolio. The current expectation of losses from potential problem assets has been included in management&#8217;s analysis for assessing the adequ acy of the allowance for loan losses. 

&#160;

Troubled Debt Restructuring and Loan Modifications 

As part of FHN&#8217;s ongoing risk management practices, FHN attempts to work with borrowers when appropriate to extend or modify loan terms to better align with their current ability to repay. Extensions and modifications to loans are made in accordance with internal policies and guidelines which conform to regulatory guidance. Each occurrence is unique to the borrower and is evaluated separately. In a situation where an economic concession has been granted to a borrower that is experiencing financial difficulty, FHN identifies and reports that loan as a Troubled Debt Restructuring (&#8220;TDR&#8221;). See Note 4 &#8211; Loans for further discussion regarding TDRs and loan modifications. 

On March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, FHN had $194.7 million and $206.3 million portfolio loans classified as TDRs, respectively. For TDRs in the loan portfolio, FHN had loan loss reserves of $13.9 million and $19.7 million, or 7 percent and 10 percent of TDR balances, as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Additionally, FHN had $50.5 million and $51.1 million of HFS loans classified as TDRs as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.

Value-at-Risk (&#8220;VaR&#8221;) and Stress Testing 

VaR is a statistical risk measure used to estimate the potential loss in value from adverse market movements over an assumed fixed holding period within a stated confidence level. FHN employs a model to compute daily VaR measures for its trading securities inventory. FHN computes VaR using historical simulation with a 1-year lookback period at a 99 percent confidence level and 1-day and 10-day time horizons. Additionally, FHN computes a Stressed VaR (&#8220;SVaR&#8221;) measure. The SVaR computation uses the same model but with model inputs reflecting historical data from a continuous 12-month period that reflects a period of significant financial stress appropriate for our trading securities portfolio.

First quarter 2020 VaR and SVaR increased due to extreme volatility as a result of economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. 

FHN&#8217;s overall VaR measure includes both interest rate risk and credit spread risk. Separate measures of these component risks are as follows:

First quarter 2020 VaR and SVaR increased due to extreme volatility as a result of economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The potential risk of loss reflected by FHN&#8217;s VaR measures assumes the trading securities inventory is static. Because FHN&#8217;s Fixed Income division procures fixed income securities for purposes of distribution to customers, its trading securities inventory turns over regularly. 

&#160;

Additionally, Fixed Income traders actively manage the trading securities inventory continuously throughout each trading day. Accordingly, FHN&#8217;s trading securities inventory is highly dynamic, rather than static. As a result, it would be rare for Fixed Income to incur a negative 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 1Q20 FORM 10-Q REPORT 107 

revenue day in its fixed income activities of the level indicated by its VaR measurements. 

In addition to being used in FHN&#8217;s daily market risk management process, the VaR and SVaR measures are also used by FHN in computing its regulatory market risk capital requirements in accordance with the Market Risk Capital rules. For additional information regarding FHN's capital adequacy refer to the "Capital" section of this MD&#38;A. 

FHN also performs stress tests on its trading securities portfolio to calculate the potential loss under various assumed market scenarios. Key assumed stresses used in those tests are: 

Down 25 bps - assumes an instantaneous downward move in interest rates of 25 basis points at all points on the interest rate yield curve. 

Up 25 bps - assumes an instantaneous upward move in interest rates of 25 basis points at all points on the interest rate yield curve. 

Curve flattening - assumes an instantaneous flattening of the interest rate yield curve through an increase in short-term rates and a decrease in long-term rates. The 2-year point on the Treasury yield curve is assumed to increase 15 basis points and the 10-year point on the Treasury yield curve is assumed to decrease 15 basis points. Shifts in other points on the yield curve are predicted based on their correlation to the 2-year and 10-year points. 

Curve steepening - assumes an instantaneous steepening of the interest rate yield curve through a decrease in short-term rates and an increase in long-term rates. The 2-year point on the Treasury yield curve is assumed to decrease 15 basis points and the 10-year point on the Treasury yield curve is assumed to increase 15 basis points. Shifts in other points on the yield curve are predicted based on their correlation to the 2-year and 10-year points. 

Credit spread widening - assumes an instantaneous increase in credit spreads (the difference between yields on Treasury securities and non-Treasury securities) of 25 basis points. 

Model Validation 

Trading risk management personnel within Fixed Income have primary responsibility for model risk management with respect to the model used by FHN to compute its VaR measures and perform stress testing on the trading inventory. Among other procedures, these personnel monitor model results and perform periodic backtesting as part of an ongoing process of validating the accuracy of the model. These model risk management activities are subject to annual review by FHN&#8217;s Model Validation Group, an independent assurance group charged with oversight responsibility for FHN&#8217;s model risk management. 

&#160;

INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT 

There have been no significant changes to FHN's interest rate risk management practices as described under "Interest Rate Risk Management" beginning o n page 90 o f Item 7 to FHN's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. 

Net Interest Income Simulation Analysis 

The information provided in this section, including the discussion regarding the outcomes of simulation analysis and rate shock analysis, is forward-looking. Actual results, if the assumed scenarios were to occur, could differ because of interest rate movements, the ability of management to execute its business plans, and other factors, including those presented in the Forward-Looking Statements section of this MD&#38;A. 

Management uses a simulation model to measure interest rate risk and to formulate strategies to improve balance sheet positioning, earnings, or both, within FHN&#8217;s interest rate risk, liquidity, and capital guidelines. Interest rate exposure is measured by forecasting 12 months of NII under various interest rate scenarios and comparing the percentage change in NII for each scenario to a base case scenario where interest rates remain unchanged. Assumptions are made regarding future balance sheet composition, interest rate movements, and loan and deposit pricing. In addition, assumptions are made about the magnitude of asset prepayments and earlier than anticipated deposit withdrawals. The results of these scenarios help FHN develop strategies for managing exposure to interest rate risk. While management believes the assumptions used and scenarios selected in its simulations are reasonable, simulation modeling provides only an estimate, not a precise calculation, of exposure to any given change in interest rates. 

Based on a static balance sheet as of March 31, 2020 , NII exposures over the next 12 months assuming rate shocks of plus 25 basis points, 50 basis points, 100 basis points, and 200 basis points are estimated to have favorable variances of 2.2 percent, 3.5 percent, 5.1 percent, and 6.5 percent, respectively compared to base NII. A steepening yield curve scenario where long-term rates increase by 50 basis points and short-term rates are static, results in a favorable NII variance of 1.7 percent. A flattening yield curve scenario where long-term rates decrease by 50 basis points and short-term rates are static, results in an unfavorable NII variance of 1.9 percent. Rate shocks of minus 25 basis points and 50 basis points result in unfavorable NII variances of 4.1 percent and 8.7 percent. These hypothetical scenarios are used to create a risk measurement framework, and do not necessarily represent management&#8217;s current view of future interest rates or market developments. 

During March 2020, the Federal Reserve lowered the Fed Funds range to 0.00% - 0.25%. However, due to 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 1Q20 FORM 10-Q REPORT 108 

dislocation in the short end of the curve, LIBOR has remained elevated compared to the Fed Funds rate. As most of FHN&#8217;s assets are indexed to LIBOR while most of FHN&#8217;s floating liabilities are indexed to Fed Funds, this has a material impact on the shock scenarios. 

FHN&#8217;s net interest income may be impacted by the disruption from the recent COVID-19 crisis. The increase in the unemployment rate, customer loan deferral requests, the impact of government assistance programs, and other developments could influence net interest income results. FHN is monitoring the current economic situation and potential exposures closely. 

CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT AND ADEQUACY 

There have been no significant changes to FHN's capital management practices as described under "Capital Risk Management and Adequacy" on pa ge 91 of Item 7 to FHN's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. 

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT 

There have been no significant changes to FHN's operational risk management practices as described under "Operational Risk Management" beginning on p age 91 of Item 7 to FHN's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. 

COMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT 

There have been no significant changes to FHN's compliance risk management practices as described under "Compliance Risk Management" on page 92 of Item 7 to FHN's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. 

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT 

There have been no significant changes to FHN's credit risk management practices as described under "Credit Risk Management" beginning on page 92 of Item 7 to FHN's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. 

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT 

ALCO also focuses on liquidity management: the funding of assets with liabilities of appropriate duration, while mitigating the risk of unexpected cash needs. ALCO and the Board of Directors have adopted a Liquidity Policy. The objective of the Liquidity Policy is to ensure that FHN meets its cash and collateral obligations promptly, in a cost-effective manner and with the highest degree of reliability. The maintenance of adequate levels of asset and liability liquidity should provide FHN with the ability to meet both expected and unexpected cash and collateral needs. Key liquidity ratios, asset liquidity levels and the amount available from funding sources are reported to ALCO on a regular basis. FHN&#8217;s Liquidity Policy 

&#160;

establishes liquidity limits that are deemed appropriate for FHN&#8217;s risk profile. 

In accordance with the Liquidity Policy, ALCO manages FHN&#8217;s exposure to liquidity risk through a dynamic, real time forecasting methodology. Base liquidity forecasts are reviewed by ALCO and are updated as financial conditions dictate. In addition to the baseline liquidity reports, robust stress testing of assumptions and funds availability are periodically reviewed. FHN maintains a contingency funding plan that may be executed, should unexpected difficulties arise in accessing funding that affects FHN, the industry as a whole, or both. Subject to market conditions and compliance with applicable regulatory requirements from time to time, funds are available from a number of sources including the available-for-sale securities portfolio, dealer and commercial customer repurchase agreements, access to the overnight and term Federal Funds markets, incremental borrowing cap acity at the F HLB ($2.1 billion wa s available at March 31, 2020 ), brokered deposits, loan sales, syndications, and access to the Federal Reserve Bank. 

Core deposits are a significant source of funding and have historically been a stable source of liquidity for banks. Generally, core deposits represent funding from a financial institution's customer base which provide inexpensive, predictable pricing. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insures these deposits to the extent authorized by law. Generally, these limits are $250 thousand per account owner for interest bearing and non-interest bearing accounts. The ratio of total loans, excluding loans HFS and restricted real estate loans, to core deposits was 100 percent on March 31, 2020 co mpared to 98 percent on December 31, 2019. 

FHN also may use unsecured short-term borrowings as a source of liquidity. Currently, the largest concentration of unsecured borrowings is federal funds purchased from correspondent bank customers. These funds are considered to be substantially more stable than funds purchased in the national broker markets for federal funds due to the long, historical, and reciprocal nature of banking services provided by FHN to these correspondent banks. The remainder of FHN&#8217;s wholesale short-term borrowings is securities sold under agreements to repurchase transactions accounted for as secured borrowings with Regional Banking&#8217;s business customers or Fixed Income&#8217;s broker dealer counterparties. 

Both FHN and First Horizon Bank may access the debt markets in order to provide funding through the issuance of senior or subordinated unsecured debt subject to market conditions and compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. In April 2020, First Horizon Bank issued $450 million of subordinated notes. These subordinated notes qualify as Tier 2 capital for First Horizon Bank as well as FHN, up to certain regulatory limits for minority interest capital instruments. 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 1Q20 FORM 10-Q REPORT 109 

Both FHN and First Horizon Bank have the ability to generate liquidity by issuing preferred equity, and (for FHN) by issuing common equity, subject to market conditions and compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. In January 2013, FHN issued $100 million of Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A. As of March 31, 2020 , First Horizon Bank and subsidiaries had outstanding preferred shares of $295.4 million, which are reflected as noncontrolling interest on the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Condition. 

Parent company liquidity is primarily provided by cash flows stemming from dividends and interest payments collected from subsidiaries. These sources of cash represent the primary sources of funds to pay cash dividends to shareholders and principal and interest to debt holders of FHN. The amount paid to the parent company through First Horizon Bank common dividends is managed as part of FHN&#8217;s overall cash management process, subject to applicable regulatory restrictions. Certain regulatory restrictions exist regarding the ability of First Horizon Bank to transfer funds to FHN in the form of cash, common dividends, loans, or advances. At any given time, the pertinent portions of those regulatory restrictions allow First Horizon Bank to declare preferred or common dividends without prior regulatory approval in an aggregate amount equal to First Horizon Bank&#8217;s retained net income for the two most recent completed years plus the current year to date. For any period, First Horizon Bank&#8217;s &#8216;retained net income&#8217; generally is equal to First Horizon Bank&#8217;s regulatory net income reduced by the preferred and common dividends declared by First Horizon Bank. Applying the dividend restrictions imposed under applicable federal and state rules as outlined above, the Bank&#8217;s total amount available for dividends was $294.7 million as of April 1, 2020. Additionally, a capital conservation buffer of 50 basis points above well-capitalized levels (equal to an extra 2.5 percent above minimum levels) must be maintained on the Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios to avoid restrictions on dividends. Since the Total Capital ratio for First Horizon Bank fell slightly below the required buffer as of March 31, 2020, these capital conservation buffer rules limit the amount of dividends that the Bank can declare in second quarter 2020 to its sole common stockholder, FHN, or to its preferred shareholders without prior regulatory approval at $70.9 million. First Horizon Bank declared and paid common dividends to the parent company in the amount of $65 million in first quarter 2020 and $345.0 million in 2019. First Horizon Bank declared and paid preferred dividends in first quarter 2020 and each quarter of 2019. Additionally, First Horizon Bank declared preferred dividends in second quarter 2020, payable in July 2020. 

Payment of a dividend to shareholders of FHN is dependent on several factors which are considered by the Board. These factors include FHN&#8217;s current and 

&#160;

prospective capital, liquidity, and other needs, applicable regulatory restrictions, and also availability of funds to FHN through a dividend from First Horizon Bank. FHN is subject to the capital conservation buffer requirements as described in the above paragraph for First Horizon Bank. Additionally, banking regulators generally require insured banks and bank holding companies to pay cash dividends only out of current operating earnings. Consequently, the decision of whether FHN will pay future dividends and the amount of dividends will be affected by current operating results. FHN paid a cash dividend of $.15 per common share on April 1, 2020, and in April 2020 the Board approved a $.15 per common share cash dividend payable on July 1, 2020, to shareholders of record on June 12, 2020. FHN paid a cash dividend of $1,550.00 per preferred share on April 10, 2020, and in April 2020 the Board approved a $1,550.00 per preferred share cash dividend payable on July 10, 2020, to shareholders of record on June 25, 2020. 

CASH FLOWS 

The Consolidated Condensed Statements of Cash Flows provide information on cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 . The level of cash and cash equivalents decreased $136.8 million during first quarter 2020 and $192.5 million in first quarter 2019. 

Net cash provided in financing activities was $3.7 billion in first quarter 2020, largely driven by an inflow of deposits and higher short-term borrowings (primarily FHLB stock). Net cash used by investing activities was $2.5 billion in first quarter 2020, driven by strong loan growth and an increase in interest-bearing cash. Net cash used by operating activities was $1.4 billion in first quarter 2020 primarily due to net cash outflows of $407.9 million related to loans held-for-sale as purchases and originations outpaced proceeds from sales and settlements, $285.4 million related to fixed income trading activities and $323.8 million related to an increase in derivatives. 

Net cash used in financing activities was $222.2 million in first quarter 2019, largely driven by a decrease in deposits, share repurchases and cash dividends paid during first quarter 2019, somewhat offset by an increase in other short-term borrowings, primarily FFP. Net cash used by investing activities was $92.7 million in first quarter 2019, largely driven by increases in loan balances somewhat offset by a decrease in interest-bearing cash and a net decrease in AFS debt securities, as maturities and sales outpaced purchases. Net cash provided by operating activities was $122.5 million in first quarter 2019 primarily due to net cash inflows of $369.2 million related to fixed income trading activities and favorably driven cash-related 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 1Q20 FORM 10-Q REPORT 110 

net income items, somewhat offset by outflows of $358.6 million related to loans held-for-sale. 

Repurchase Obligations, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, and Other Contractual Obligations 

Obligations from Pre-2009 Mortgage Businesses 

Prior to September 2008 FHN originated loans through its pre-2009 mort gage business, primarily first lien home loans, with the intention of selling them. Sales typically were effected either as non-recourse whole loan sales or through non-recourse proprietary securitizations. Conventional conforming single-family residential mortgage loans were sold predominately to two government-sponsored entities, or "GSEs": Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Also, federally insured or guaranteed whole loans were pooled, and payments to investors were guaranteed through Ginnie Mae. Many mortgage loan originations, especially nonconforming mortgage loans, were sold to investors, or certificate-holders, predominantly through First Horizon proprietary securitizations but also, to a lesser extent, through other whole loans sold to private non-Agency purchasers. FHN used only one trustee for all of its First Horizon proprietary securitizations. In addition to First Horizon proprietary securitization and other whole loan sales activities, FHN also originated and sometimes sold or securitized second-lien, line of credit, and government-insured mortgage loans. 

From these pre-2009 activities, FHN has incurred substantial losses stemming from obligations to repurchase loans, pay make-whole amounts, or otherwise resolve claims that loans which FHN originated, or FHN's servicing of those loans, were deficient in a manner for which FHN was liable. Many years ago, FHN established a repurchase and foreclosure liability, or reserve, in connection with those claims. FHN has settled many claims, and the reserve is reduced each time a claim is settled. As discussed in Note 10 - Contingencies and Other Disclosures, FHN's principal remaining exposures for those activities relate to (i) indemnification claims by underwriters, loan purchasers, and other parties which assert that FHN-originated loans caused or contributed to losses which FHN is legally obliged to indemnify, and (ii) indemnification or other claims related to FHN's servicing of pre-2009 mortgage loans. 

Servicing Obligations 

FHN's national servicing business was sold as part of the platform sale in 2008. A significant amount of mortgage servicing rights ("MSR") was sold at that time, and a significant amount was retained. The related servicing activities, including foreclosure and loss mitigation practices, not sold in 2008 were outsourced including a subservicing arrangement initiated in 2011 (the "2011 subservicer"). In fourth quarter 2013 and first quarter 2014, FHN sold and transferred a substantial majority of its 

&#160;

remaining servicing obligations and servicing assets (including advances) to the 2011 subservicer. The servicing still retained by FHN is not significant and continues to be subserviced. 

As servicer, FHN had contractual obligations to the owners of the loans (primarily GSEs) and securitization trustees to handle billing, custodial, and other tasks related to each loan. Each subservicer undertook to perform those obligations on FHN's behalf during the applicable subservicing period, although FHN legally remained the servicer of record for those loans that were subserviced. 

As mentioned in Note 10 - Contingencies and Other Disclosures - FHN has received a notice of indemnification claims from its 2011 subservicer, Nationstar Mortgage LLC, currently doing business as "Mr. Cooper." The notice asserts several categories of indemnity obligations by FHN to Nationstar in connection with mortgage loans under the subservicing arrangement and under the purchase transaction. This matter currently is not in formal litigation, but litigation in the future is possible. 

Repurchase Accrual Methodology 

FHN&#8217;s approach for determining the adequacy of the repurchase and foreclosure reserve has evolved, sometimes substantially, based on changes in information available. Repurchase/make-whole rates vary based on purchaser, vintage, and claim type. For those loans repurchased or covered by a make-whole payment, cumulative average loss severities range between 50 and 60 percent of the UPB. 

Repurchase Accrual Approach 

In determining potential loss content, claims are analyzed by purchaser, vintage, and claim type. FHN considers various inputs including claim rate estimates, historical average repurchase and loss severity rates, mortgage insurance cancellations, and mortgage insurance curtailment requests. Inputs are applied to claims in the active pipeline, as well as to historical average inflows to estimate loss content related to potential future inflows. Management also evaluates the nature of claims from purchasers and/or servicers of loans sold to determine if qualitative adjustments are appropriate. 

Repurchase and Foreclosure Liability 

The repurchase and foreclosure liability is comprised of accruals to cover estimated loss content in the active pipeline (consisting of mortgage loan repurchase, make-whole, foreclosure/servicing demands and certain related exposures), estimated future inflows, and estimated loss content related to certain known claims not currently 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 1Q20 FORM 10-Q REPORT 111 

included in the active pipeline. The liability contemplates repurchase/make-whole and damages obligations and estimates for probable incurred losses associated with loan populations excluded from the settlements with the GSEs, as well as other whole loans sold, mortgage insurance cancellations rescissions, and loans included in bulk servicing sales effected prior to the settlements with the GSEs. FHN compares the estimated probable incurred losses determined under the applicable loss estimation 

&#160;

approaches for the respective periods with current reserve levels. Changes in the estimated required liability levels are recorded as necessary through the repurchase and foreclosure provision. The repurchase and foreclosure liability decreased to $13.5 million on March 31, 2019 from $14.5 million on December 31, 2019. 

Market Uncertainties and Prospective Trends 

FHN&#8217;s future results could be affected both positively and negatively by several known trends. Key among those are changes in the U.S. and global economy and outlook, government actions affecting interest rates, availability and the administration of stimulus relief for the economy and FHN&#8217;s customers related to the recent global COVID-19 pandemic, political uncertainty, potential changes in federal policies and the potential impact to our customers, and FHN&#8217;s strategic initiatives. In addition, pre-2009 mortgage business matters in the Non-strategic segment could continue to impact FHN&#8217;s quarterly results in ways which are both difficult to predict and unrelated to current operations. 

Performance by FHN, and the entire U.S. financial services industry, is affected considerably by the overall health of the U.S. and global economy and outlook. Furthermore, FHN may be directly or indirectly impacted by global events that impact our customers and their businesses. The recent global COVID-19 pandemic has led to periods of significant volatility in financial commodities (including oil and gas) and other markets, has adversely affected FHN&#8217;s ability to conduct normal business, has adversely affected FHN customers, and is likely to harm FHN&#8217;s business and future results of operations. 

In March 2020 the Federal Reserve lowered short-term interest rates twice and started a &#8220;quantitative easing&#8221; program intended to lower longer-term interest rates and foster access to credit. The effective yields of 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury securities achieved record low rates and the U.S. Congress enacted relief legislation which, among other things, is intended to provide emergency credit to businesses at risk for failure from government and public actions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and to mitigate an economic recession. These changes in interest rates and the volatility in the market are likely to negatively impact FHN&#8217;s net interest margin. In the near term, amortization of net processing fees related to government relief programs, including the Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP"), may offset a portion of the net interest margin decline. In addition, credit spreads have widened. For new loans, wider spreads should help mitigate net interest margin compression. However, FHN will not be able to capture the widened spreads quickly for outstanding floating-rate loans. 

&#160;

The economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have significantly altered business in the U.S. and globally leading to partial or full business closures, individuals being furloughed or laid off, significant increases in unemployment, and workers being partially or wholly ordered to work from home. Disruption to FHN&#8217;s customers due to governmental and societal responses to COVID-19 are likely to adversely affect FHN&#8217;s loan and deposit fee income as well as create downward loan migration and a corresponding increase in loan loss expense and reserves. In addition, loan charge-offs likely will increase over time, especially if economic disruption related to COVID-19 continues for more than a few months. Furthermore, government programs under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the &#8220;CARES Act&#8221;) and other guidance intended to provide relief to customers through temporary modifications and deferrals, may in some instances mask or postpone reporting of credit problems and potential defaults. In these circumstances, current credit quality indicators may not be reflective of the underlying health of FHN's portfolios. 

Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is difficult to predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the businesses of FHN for the remainder of 2020 or afterward. 

In 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the London InterBank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;), announced that it intends to halt persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. As a result, LIBOR as currently operated may not continue after 2021. FHN is not currently able to predict the impact that the transition from LIBOR will have on the Company; however, because FHN has instruments with floating rate terms based on LIBOR, FHN may experience increases in interest, dividends, and other costs relative to these instruments subsequent to 2021. Additionally, the transition from LIBOR could impact or change FHN&#8217;s hedge accounting practices. FHN has initiated efforts to 1) develop an inventory of affected loans, securities, and derivatives, 2) evaluate and draft modifications as needed to address loans outstanding at the time of LIBOR retirement, 3) obtain an understanding of the potential 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 1Q20 FORM 10-Q REPORT 112 

effects for applicable securities and derivatives and 4) assess revisions to product pricing structures based on alternative reference rates. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, &#8220;Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting,&#8221; which provides several optional expedients and exceptions to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform. Refer to the Accounting Changes Issued but Not Currently Effective section of Note 1 - Financial Information for additional information. Additionally, the IRS has released a proposal that is intended to facilitate the transition of existing contracts from LIBOR to new reference rates without triggering modification accounting or taxable exchange treatment for those contracts. This proposal contains specific guidance that must be met in order to qualify for the beneficial transition approach and FHN is considering this guidance in its transition plans. 

FHN has prioritized expense discipline to include reducing or controlling certain expenses including realization of expense efficiencies from its 2017 merger with CBF and investing in revenue-producing activities, customer-facing technology, and critical infrastructure. FHN remains committed to organic growth through customer retention, key hires, targeted incentives, and other traditional means. 

When FHN closes its proposed merger with IBKC, under applicable accounting guidance FHN will be required to record IBKC's loans at estimated fair value as of the closing date. In addition, FHN will be required to assess the current (at that time) expected credit losses associated with IBKC loans. That credit loss assessment will be separate from the fair value estimation, and will result in a charge to FHN's income for certain loans for the period in which closing occurs. FHN is not able make that assessment at this time, but believes that the associated charge to income will be substantial to quarterly income. 

Lastly, while FHN has resolved most matters from the pre-2009 mortgage business, some remain unresolved. The timing or financial impact of resolution of these matters cannot be predicted with accuracy. Accordingly, the non-strategic segment may occasionally and unexpectedly impact FHN&#8217;s overall quarterly results negatively or positively with reserve accruals or releases. Also, although new pre-2009 mortgage business matters of significance arise at a much slower pace than in years past and some formerly common legal claims no longer can be made due to the passage of time, potential for new pre-2009 mortgage business matters remains. 

Foreclosure Practices 

FHN retains exposure for potential deficiencies in servicing related to its pre-2009 mortgage servicing business and subservicing arrangements. Further details regarding these matters are provided in

FHN response to the COVID-19 pandemic 

As previously mentioned, the COVID-19 pandemic has, and will continue, to directly and indirectly impact FHN and our customers. FHN has adapted many operations to help ensure the health and safety of employees and customers during these uncertain times. Among other things, FHN has implemented remote work policies, branch activities handled by appointment or via drive-through only, as well as additional sick time and child care assistance for employees. Additionally, FHN&#8217;s foundation has donated $2.5 million to support community relief efforts. 

Loans 

FHN is actively monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on customers and FHN&#8217;s credit quality. In response, FHN is proactively reaching out to customers to discuss challenges and solutions, is providing line draws and new extensions to existing customers, is providing support for small businesses through the PPP (discussed in more detail below) and other stimulus programs, as well as providing lending and deposit assistance through deferrals and waived fees. Additionally, in certain sectors, FHN has reduced or stopped new lending. 

Paycheck Protection Program 

On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law. Sections 1102 and 1106 of the CARES Act include a PPP that made $349 billion of funds available for qualifying businesses to receive fully-guaranteed loans via the Small Business Administration&#8217;s Section 7(a) lending program. These loans are potentially fully forgivable, depending upon the borrower&#8217;s use of the funds and maintenance of employment levels. 

PPP loans are intended to provide cash-flow assistance to nonprofit and small business employers for expenses incurred between February 15, 2020, and June 30, 2020. Generally, the maximum loan amount per qualified borrower is the lesser of 1) 250 percent of average monthly payroll costs (e.g., salaries and wages up to $100,000 and benefits) during the previous one-year period plus the outstanding amount of any existing SBA Economic Injury Disaster Loan made from January 1, 2020 through April 3, 2020, that is being refinanced under the PPP and 2) $10 million. Eligible borrowers include any of the following that were in operation on February 15, 2020: 

&#8226; 

Businesses, including nonprofit organizations under Internal Revenue Code (&#8220;IRC&#8221;) Section 501(c)(3), veterans&#8217; organizations under IRC Section 501(c)(19), and tribal organizations, that 

FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP. 1Q20 FORM 10-Q REPORT 113 

have 500 or fewer employees (or the Small Business Administration&#8217;s employee-based or revenue-based industry size standard, if higher). 

&#8226; 

Businesses in the food and accommodations industry (as defined in NAICS 724) with 500 or fewer employees per location. 

&#8226; 

Sole proprietors, independent contractors, and self-employed individuals. 

All PPP loans carry the same terms which are as follows: 

&#8226; 

Fixed interest rate of 1 percent per annum 

&#8226; 

Maturity date of two years, with the ability to prepay earlier with no fees 

&#8226; 

First payment deferred for six months 

&#8226; 

Waiver of &#8220;credit elsewhere&#8221; SBA 7(a) requirement 

&#8226; 

No collateral or personal guarantees required 

&#8226; 

No borrower fees charged to obtain such loans 

Under Section 1106 of the CARES Act, borrowers are eligible for forgiveness of principal and accrued interest on PPP loans to the extent that the proceeds are used to cover eligible payroll, interest, rent, and utility costs over the eight-week period after the loan is made as long as the borrower retains its employees and their compensation levels. However, no more than 25 percent of loan forgiveness may be attributable to eligible rent, utilities and interest. In addition, loans qualifying for forgiveness will not be included in the borrower&#8217;s taxable income. 

Lenders making these PPP loans are paid a fee by the Small Business Administration on the date the loans are made. Lender fees are based on the following sliding scale. 

&#8226; 

Loans $350,000 and under: 5.00% 

&#8226; 

Loans greater than $350,000 to $2 million: 3.00% 

&#8226; 

Loans greater than $2 million: 1.00% 

Borrowers can use agents to assist in the preparation of their PPP applications. Those agents are paid from the SBA fees received from the originating bank. Additionally, originating banks have certain internal costs of originating PPP loans. For applicable loans, agent fees are paid by originating banks based on the following scale. 

&#8226; 

Loans $350,000 and under: 1.00% 

&#8226; 

Loans greater than $350,000 to $2 million: 0.50% 

&#8226; 

Loans greater than $2 million: 0.25% 

&#160;

The SBA provides a 100 percent guarantee on PPP loans, which is an increase to the existing guarantee percentages under current SBA loan programs. In the event that a lender sells a PPP loan on the secondary market, the guarantee will transfer with the loan. Lenders are not required to conduct any verification regarding loan forgiveness provided that a borrower submits documentation supporting its request for loan forgiveness and attests that it has accurately verified the eligibility of the expenditures made. Lenders will be held harmless if they rely on such documentation. Lenders must make a decision on the forgiveness within 60 days. Section 1106 of the CARES Act indicates that any lender or purchaser of PPP loans may report to the SBA an expected forgiveness amount, and the SBA will purchase the expected forgiveness amounts, plus any interest accrued to date, within 15 days after such requests are received. Requests for forgiveness may occur as early as seven weeks after the loan is originated. 

As part of FHN&#8217;s efforts to support customers through various stimulus programs, FHN originated 6,761 of PPP loans with an aggregate principal of $1.7 billion in April 2020. For these loans, FHN anticipates recognizing net origination fees of approximately $45 to $50 million. Additional lower origination volumes are anticipated in May. FHN has decided to hold its PPP loans for investment. Therefore, the net amount of SBA fees and total direct origination costs are deferred as a discount to the recorded carrying value of the PPP loans. This discount is being amortized prospectively to interest income. SBA loan forgiveness payments are considered prepayments of the related loans. Under existing accounting principles, amortization of net origination fees can reflect expected prepayment activity if prepayments are determined to be probable and both the timing and volume can be reasonably estimated. Based on the terms of the PPP loans, including the expected end of the payment deferral period, FHN estimates that substantially all of the prepayment-eligible portions of PPP loans will be prepaid in 2020 as these loans are forgiven. These estimated prepayments will result in a similar amount of the net fees being recognized in interest income in 2020. 

Since PPP loans carry a full SBA guarantee, they do not have any credit risk and will not affect the amount of provision and ALLL recorded. Consistent with this view, the CARES Act indicates that investors should assign a risk weight of zero to PPP loans for regulatory capital purposes. 

The initial funding for the $359 billion PPP loans was exhausted by April 16, 2 020. However, on April 24, 2020, an additional $320 billion of funding was approved for the PPP. These funds will likely be exhausted in early May.

and Middle Tennessee markets), franchise finance (13 percent or $334.9 million), business banking (8 percent or $208.9 million), and private client (6 percent - $152.0 million). 

Deposits 

Deposit levels were also significantly impacted in April due to the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in an increase in period-end deposits of $3.7 billion, or 11 percent, from March 31, 2020 levels. This increase was due to an increase in commercial deposits as FHN saw many firms deposit funds (from lines of credit, PPP loans, operational revenues, etc.) into non-interest bearing operating accounts in order to increase their liquidity positions. Additionally, as various government stimulus programs were rolled out FHN saw increases in deposits from the Healthcare industry as Medicare reimbursements related to COVID-19 became available and a jump in deposits in Correspondent banking due to stimulus and PPP funds deposited into client banks. Consumer deposit inflows were also impacted by approximately $300 million in initial stimulus payments in mid-April. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Except for the changes to the following Allowance for Loan Losses section, there have been no significant changes to FHN&#8217;s critical accounting policies as described in &#8220;Critical Accounting Policies&#8221; beginning on page 99 of Item 7 to FHN&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. 

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES 

Management&#8217;s policy is to maintain the ALLL at a level sufficient to absorb expected credit losses in the loan portfolio. Management performs periodic and systematic detailed reviews of its loan portfolio to identify trends and to assess the overall collectability of the loan portfolio. Management believes the accounting estimate related to the ALLL is a &#8220;critical accounting estimate&#8221; as: (1) changes in it can materially affect the provision for loan losses and net income, (2) it requires management to predict borrowers&#8217; likelihood or capacity to repay, including evaluation of inherently uncertain future economic conditions, (3) prepayment activity must be projected to estimate of the life of loans that often are shorter than contractual terms, (4) it requires estimation of a reasonable and supportable forecast period for credit losses for loan portfolio segments before reversion to historical loss levels over the remaining life of a loan and (5) expected future recoveries of amounts previously charged off must be estimated. Accordingly, this is a highly subjective process and requires significant judgment since it is difficult to evaluate current and future economic conditions in relation to an overall credit cycle and estimate the timing and extent of loss events that are expected to occur prior to end of a loan&#8217;s estimated life. The ALLL is increased by the provision for loan losses and recoveries and is decreased by charged-off loans. Principal loan amounts are charged off against the ALLL in the period in which the loan or any portion of the loan is deemed to be uncollectible. This critical accounting estimate applies to the regional banking, non-strategic, and corporate segments. A management committee comprised of representatives from Risk Management, Finance, Credit, and Treasury performs a quarterly review of the assumptions used in FHN&#8217;s ALLL analytical models, makes qualitative assessments of the loan portfolio, and determines if qualitative adjustments should be recommended to the modeled results. On a quarterly basis, as a part of Enterprise Risk reporting and discussion, management addresses credit reserve adequacy and credit losses with the Executive and Risk Committee of FHN&#8217;s Board of Directors. 

FHN believes that the critical assumptions underlying the accounting estimates made by management include: (1) the commercial loan portfolio has been properly risk graded based on information about borrowers in specific industries and specific issues with respect to single borrowers; (2) borrower specific information made available to FHN is current and accurate; (3) the loan portfolio has been segmented properly and individual loans have similar credit risk characteristics and will behave similarly; (4) the lives for loan portfolio pools have been estimated properly, including consideration of expected prepayments; (5) the economic forecasts utilized in the modeling of expected credit losses are reflective of future economic conditions; (6) entity-specific historical loss information has been properly assessed for all loan portfolio segments as the 

&#160;

initial basis for estimating expected credit losses; (7) the reasonable and supportable periods for loan portfolio segments have been properly determined; (8) the reversion methodologies and timeframes for migration from the reasonable and supportable period to the use of historical loss rates are reasonable; (9) expected recoveries of prior charge off amounts have been properly estimated; and (10) qualitative adjustments to modeled loss results reasonably reflect expected future credit losses as of the date of the financial statements. 

While management uses the best information available to establish the ALLL, future adjustments to the ALLL and methodology may be necessary if economic or other conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the estimates. Such adjustments to original estimates, as necessary, are made in the period in which these factors and other relevant considerations indicate that loss levels vary from previous estimates. 

See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5 - Allowance for Loan Losses for detail regarding FHN&#8217;s processes, models, and methodology for determining the ALLL.
