Item 1. Business 

Our Businesses 

Overview 

First Horizon Corporation is a Tennessee corporation. We incorporated in 1968, and are headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee. We are a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act, and a financial holding company under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol &#8220;FHN.&#8221; At December 31, 2021, we had total consolidated assets of $89 billion. We provide diversified financial services primarily through our principal subsidiary, First Horizon Bank. The Bank is a Tennessee banking corporation headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee. 

During 2021 approximately 35% of our consolidated revenues were provided by fee and other noninterest income, and approximately 65% of revenues were provided by net interest income. 

As a financial holding company, we coordinate the financial resources of the consolidated enterprise and maintain systems of financial, operational, and administrative control intended to coordinate selected policies and activities, including as described in Item 9A of Part II. 

The Bank 

The Bank was founded in 1864 as First National Bank of Memphis. During 2021, through its various business lines, including consolidated subsidiaries, the Bank reported revenues (net interest income plus noninterest income) of approximately $3 billion. The Bank generated a substantial majority of First Horizon&#8217;s consolidated revenue. At 

December 31, 2021, the Bank had $89 billion in total assets, $76 billion in total deposits, and $54 billion in total loans and leases (net of unearned income and net of allowance for loan and lease losses). 

Principal Businesses, Brands, &#38; Locations 

At year-end 2021 our principal businesses were conducted mostly under two or three brands. Brand integration from the IBKC merger was delayed until February 2022, after which we began phasing out certain brands. Our principal brands at year-end are summarized in Table 1.1.

##TABLE_END

fixed income, title services, home mortgage, wealth management, and commercial loan offices. The largest groups of those offices were: 29 fixed income offices in 16 states across the U.S.; 30 title services offices in Arkansas, 

Tennessee, and Louisiana; and 15 stand-alone mortgage lending offices in 9 states. First Horizon also has operational and administrative offices. 

Loans &#38; Deposits 

Lending and deposit-taking are core businesses for us. Our largest resource to fund our lending is our deposit base. At year-end 2021, we had total loans (net of unearned income) of $55 billion, total net loans (net of unearned income and net of allowance for loan and lease losses) of $54 billion, and total deposits of $75 billion. Most of our loans and deposits are held in our regional banking and specialty banking segments. Most of our loans are commercial, and most of them are traditional, unsecured commercial, financial, and industrial loans, or &#8220;C&#38;I&#8221; loans. The other two major loan portfolios are secured commercial real estate loans, or &#8220;CRE&#8221; loans, and secured consumer real estate loans. Table 1.3 provides an overview of our loan and deposit balances at December 31, 2021 or averaged over the year 2021.

Business Segments 

Segment Overview 

Our financial results of operations are reported through operational business segments which are not closely related to the legal structure of our subsidiaries. As a result of our recent merger of equals with IBERIABANK Corporation (see Significant Business Developments over Past Five Years in this Item 1 below), we changed our segments. Before the merger, we operated through four business segments: regional banking, fixed income, corporate, and non-strategic. Currently, we operate through three segments: regional banking, specialty banking, and corporate. In this report, segment information related to prior periods has been reclassified to conform with current segments. 

Financial and other additional information concerning our segments&#8212;including information concerning assets, revenues, and financial results&#8212;appears in our 2021 MD&#38;A (Item 7) and in our 2021 Financial Statements (Item 8), especially in Note 20&#8212;Business Segment Information. Note 20 begins on page 178 . 

Regional and Specialty Banking Segments 

By far most of our loans and deposits are in the regional banking and specialty banking segments. Similarly, those segments are the sources of most of our revenues and expenses. The two segments create and use financial resources differently, and they generate different types of revenues. Most notably: regional banking provides a majority of our net interest income (mainly from lending), while specialty banking provides more noninterest income (mainly from fees). In addition, regional banking is larger than specialty banking by many financial measures. Table 1.6 provides high-level financial information for each of those two segments, highlighting these points.

Regional and Specialty Lines of Business 

The principal lines of business in the regional banking segment are: 

&#8226; commercial banking (larger business enterprises) 

&#8226; business banking (smaller business enterprises) 

&#8226; consumer banking 

&#8226; private client and wealth management 

The principal lines of business in the specialty banking segment are: 

&#8226; fixed income/capital markets 

&#8226; professional commercial real estate (Pro-CRE) 

&#8226; mortgage warehouse lending 

&#8226; asset-based (secured) lending 

&#8226; franchise finance 

&#8226; equipment finance 

&#8226; corporate banking 

&#8226; correspondent banking 

&#8226; mortgage origination and title services 

Geographically, regional banking's businesses mainly serve our traditional markets associated with our banking center footprint. Many of the businesses within specialty banking have much broader geographic reach. For example: our fixed income business has offices from Hawaii to Massachusetts; and California is listed in Table 1.5 primarily because of specialty banking business lines.

Priorities &#38; Developments 

Over the past five years, our strategic priorities have focused on: 

&#8226; targeted and opportunistic expansion of consumer and commercial banking products and markets; 

&#8226; targeted and opportunistic expansion of commercial lending, mainly through strategic and tactical transactions, talent development, and talent acquisitions; 

&#8226; rigorous expense management with continued investment in revenue generating initiatives; 

&#8226; managing business units and products with a strong emphasis on risk-adjusted returns on invested capital; 

&#8226; providing exceptional client service and experience as a primary means to differentiate us from competitors; and 

&#8226; investment in scalable technology and other infrastructure to attract and retain clients and to support expansion. 

Examples of our implementation of these priorities include: 

##TABLE_START 

&#160; 12 

2021 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT ##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

##TABLE_END

&#8226; In July 2020, we completed a merger of equals transaction with IBERIABANK Corporation and purchased 30 branches from Truist Bank, making 2020 a transformative year. See IBKC Merger of Equals and 30-Branch Acquisition in this Item below for additional information. In February 2022, we completed the main systems conversion work related to that merger. 

&#8226; As shown in Table 1.7, the COVID-19 pandemic caused us to recognize substantial provision for credit losses in 2020, and reduced our transaction volume and revenues. See the discussion captioned CECL Accounting and COVID-19 within Events Impacting Year-to-Year Comparisons , immediately below. In 2021, a large portion of that provision expense was effectively reversed, resulting in a provision credit for the year. 

&#8226; The pandemic also resulted in strong deposit growth in 2020 and 2021, despite interest rates being extremely low. We believe federal assistance and stimulus programs in 2020 and early 2021 significantly bolstered deposits in both years. 

&#8226; In 2017 we merged with Capital Bank Financial Corp., which had $10 billion of total assets and nearly 200 banking centers in four southern U.S. states. In another 2017 transaction, we acquired a national leader in trading, securitization, and analysis of Small Business Association loans. 

&#8226; We have made key talent hires in critical areas throughout our company, with the main focus on organically growing economically profitable business lines inside and outside our traditional markets. 

&#8226; Throughout this period, but especially in 2021, we have pruned and adapted our physical banking center network to reflect long-term trends in client usage of banking centers, and are making more efficient use of other physical facilities. Correspondingly, we have expanded and enhanced our digital banking products and services. These efforts are expected to continue. 

&#8226; Lending has been strong in certain specialty areas, such as lending to mortgage companies, where demand is strongly stimulated by the low interest rates in effect during this period. 

Events Impacting Year-to-Year Comparisons 

IBKC Merger of Equals in 2020 

In July 2020, we closed our merger of equals with IBERIABANK Corporation (&#8220;IBKC&#8221;). IBKC was the parent company of IBERIABANK based in Lafayette, Louisiana. At year-end 2019, IBKC had $31.7 billion of total assets&#8212;nearly 75% of our size at that time&#8212;and operated over 190 banking centers in 11 states: Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, North and South Carolina, and New York. IBKC&#8217;s largest concentrations of banking centers were in Louisiana and Florida. We and IBKC offered many of the same financial services before the merger, but IBKC exceeded us in several areas, most notably in equipment financing, mortgage, and title services. 

After closing, our board expanded to 17 directors, of which nine are from legacy First Horizon and eight are from legacy IBKC. IBKC shareholders collectively were issued 243 million First Horizon common shares (on a net basis). 

Under applicable accounting guidance, none of the income or expense recognized by IBKC prior to the merger is included in our income or expense for 2020. As a result, our 2020 operating results consist of approximately two quarters of legacy First Horizon plus approximately two quarters of combined First Horizon and IBKC. In addition, operating results in 2020 were significantly affected by merger-related expenses and by two significant accounting impacts, described in Large Accounting Impacts from IBKC Merger below. 

30-Branch Acquisition in 2020 

In July 2020, we purchased 30 branches in North Carolina (20), Virginia (8), and Georgia (2) from SunTrust Bank (now Truist Bank). Those branches are in markets which we did not serve before July, or in which we did not have a leading market position. Along with the branch facilities, we acquired $0.4 billion of related loans and assumed $2.2 billion of deposits. 

Large Accounting Impacts from IBKC Merger 

Under applicable accounting guidance, closing the IBKC merger in July created two substantial impacts on our operating results for 2020. First, although we were required to record IBKC&#8217;s loans at fair value on the closing date, we also were required to recognize, as a provision for credit losses, an estimate of current expected credit losses for certain acquired loans. A similar process, with much smaller numbers, occurred for the loans associated with the 30-branch purchase. The overall incremental expense, recorded in third quarter 2020, was $147 million. Moreover, we were required to record, on a preliminary basis, a nontaxable purchase accounting gain from the merger of $533 million, driven by the stock market decline in 2020 associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The net result of those two impacts was a $386 million uplift to our pretax income in 2020 unrelated to the ordinary operation of our businesses. 

Expenses related to IBKC Merger 

Closing the IBKC merger, integrating the business operations and systems, and making the changes necessary to achieve intended cost and other synergies resulted in substantial noninterest expenses in 2020 and 

##TABLE_START 

&#160; 13 

2021 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT ##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

##TABLE_END

in 2021. Additional significant expenses related to integration and optimization will be incurred in 2022. 

Low Credit Loss Rates through 2019 

During 2017-2019, our provision for credit losses was unusually low, though in 2019 it began to normalize. When provision is low, differences from year to year can be idiosyncratic, driven by just a few clients. 

CECL Accounting and COVID-19 

Starting in 2020, accounting guidance changed, requiring us to recognize &#8220;current expected credit loss&#8221; on all loans. The new guidance had the effect of accelerating, compared to prior guidance, the recognition of provision expense at times when general economic conditions deteriorate in a rapid manner. Starting in March 2020, government and public reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic caused substantial and rapid, and previously unexpected, business disruption and economic deterioration. Those events substantially changed our expectations for future credit loss and, accordingly, our provision was significantly elevated in 2020. 

In 2021, we recognized net provision credit (negative expense) in the year overall, as a portion of credit loss accrued in 2020 was effectively reversed and underlying credit loss trends remained modest in most portfolios. 

Fixed Income Volatility 

In 2017 and 2018, market conditions were quite subdued for our fixed income business. Starting in 2019, however, increased market volatility and the downward direction of interest rates resulted in much higher trading volume and noninterest income in that business. In 2021, performance in fixed income started to moderate as market conditions started to change again, and we expect moderation to continue into 2022. See the Fixed Income discussion under Cyclicality within the Other Business Information section of this Item, which begins on page 18 , for additional information. 

Sale of Visa Class B Stock in 2018 

In 2018, we sold our remaining legacy stock holdings of Visa for a large gain, significantly increasing noninterest income that year. 

Capital Bank Merger in 2017 

Many year-end balance sheet figures (loans, deposits, etc.) increased substantially in 2017 due to the Capital Bank transaction. Full-year operating results were less noticeably impacted until 2018, because the Capital Bank transaction closed late in 2017. 

Tax Reform in 2017 

Corporate tax reform in December 2017 resulted in significant negative adjustments to net deferred tax asset 

balance, driving a large net loss in fourth quarter that year. Financial results after 2017, in contrast, benefited significantly from lower tax rates compared to earlier years. 

Monetary Policy Shifts 

Although interest rates during each of these years were quite low by historical standards, short-term rates were raised in 2017 and 2018. Short-term rates were reduced in 2019 and again in 2020, the latter in response to the pandemic. An asset-buying program by the Federal Reserve put downward pressure on long-term interest rates as well, especially in 2020 and 2021. These changes impacted our net interest margin, raising and lowering it over this period. Net interest margin is a measure of the profit we make on loans and other earning assets in relation to our cost of deposits and other funding sources. Because funding costs cannot realistically fall below zero, the very low rate environment during 2020-21 resulted in historically low net interest margin levels for us. 

During much of 2021, the Federal Reserve kept short-term rates low and maintained an asset-buying program intended to put downward pressure on long-term rates. Late in 2021, and continuing into 2022, the Federal Reserve has signaled that its asset-buying program will cease, that it expects to start raising short-term rates in reaction to price inflation experienced in the U.S. during much of 2021, and that it expects to reduce its asset holdings once buying has stopped. 

Additional information concerning monetary policy and changes to it appears: within the Effect of Governmental Policies and Proposals section of Item 1 beginning on page 29 ; under the caption Risks Associated with Monetary Events beginning on page 38 within Item 1A; and under the caption Federal Reserve Policy in Transition within the Market Uncertainties and Prospective Trends section of 2021 MD&#38;A (Item 7), which begins on page 99 . 

Mortgage-Related Businesses 

We lend to mortgage lending companies, we originate mortgage loans, and we provide title and related services that depend significantly on new and refinanced home mortgage activity. Lending to mortgage companies has been a significant business for us in all five years shown in Table 1.7, while the latter two businesses were insignificant for us until our merger with IBKC in 2020. 

All three mortgage-related businesses benefited substantially from the recent low interest rate environment. As discussed above, we expect mortgage rates to rise in 2022, which should moderate revenues and income in all three businesses compared to 2021.

Significant Trends Past Five Years 

Noteworthy trends during these five years included: 

&#8226; Growth in net interest income was significant through 2018, driven by net loan growth, interest rate increases, and (in 2018) the Capital Bank merger. Growth flattened in 2019 as net loan growth, especially in mortgage warehouse lending, was offset by net interest margin declines. Margin declines continued in 2020 and 2021, though loan balances increased substantially with the IBERIABANK merger. 

&#8226; In 2017, an overall downward trend in noninterest income was due mainly to lower fixed income revenues, driven by challenging market conditions. The large increase in 2018 was mainly due to the Visa stock sale, along with an uptick following the Capital Bank merger. The 2017 downward trend reversed in 2019-21 as interest rates declined, market volatility increased, and fixed income revenues improved markedly. Also, 2020 and 2021 enjoyed a substantial increase in noninterest income following the IBERIABANK merger, especially in relation to consumer mortgage originations and related services. 

&#8226; The large deposit upticks in 2017 and 2020 were driven substantially by the Capital Bank, IBERIABANK, and 30-branch transactions. Also in 2020 and 2021, the federal Paycheck Protection Program (&#8220;PPP&#8221;) contributed to deposit growth as proceeds from PPP loans boosted average deposit account balances. Organic growth in deposits from core banking clients grew throughout this period, even when interest rates were extremely low. That core growth is masked in some years by our deliberate reductions in market-indexed deposits, which tend to be higher rate, and in other years by those large transactions. 

&#8226; Throughout 2020, and to a lesser extent in 2021, economic and business disruption related to the COVID-19 pandemic created substantial challenges for our clients and for our company. The disruptions in late 2021 from yet another new variant of the virus have continued in early 2022. 

Exited Businesses 

Over the past five years, we have focused primarily on regional banking and specialty banking products and services. We have partially or fully exited some smaller businesses during those years. Exited businesses are 

managed in our corporate segment currently, and were managed in our non-strategic segment before 2020. 

2022 Merger Agreement with Toronto-Dominion Bank 

On February 27, 2022, FHN entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#8220;TD Merger Agreement&#8221;) with The Toronto-Dominion Bank, a Canadian chartered bank (&#8220;TD&#8221;), TD Bank US Holding Company, a Delaware corporation and indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of TD (&#8220;TD-US&#8221;), and Falcon Holdings Acquisition Co., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of TD-US (&#8220;Merger Sub&#8221;). 

Pursuant to the TD Merger Agreement, FHN and Merger Sub will merge (the &#8220;First Holding Company Merger&#8221;), with FHN continuing as the surviving entity in the merger. Following the First Holding Company Merger, at the election of TD, FHN and TD-US will merge (the &#8220;Second Holding Company Merger&#8221; and, together with the First Holding Company Merger, the &#8220;Holding Company Mergers&#8221;), with TD-US continuing as the surviving entity in the merger. 

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the TD Merger Agreement, each share of FHN common stock, par value $0.625 per share, (&#8220;Company Common Stock&#8221;), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the First Holding Company Merger (the 

&#8220;First Effective Time&#8221;) will be converted into the right to receive $25.00 (USD) per share in cash, without interest. If the transaction does not close on or before November 27, 2022, shareholders will receive an additional $0.65 per share of Company Common Stock on an annualized basis (or approximately 5.4 cents per month) for the period from November 27, 2022 through the day immediately prior to the closing. Each outstanding share of FHN&#8217;s preferred stock, series B, C, D, E and F, will remain issued outstanding in connection with the First Holding Company Merger. If TD elects to effect the Second Holding Company Merger, at the effective time of the Second Holding Company Merger, each outstanding share of FHN&#8217;s preferred stock will be converted into a share of a newly created, corresponding series of TD-US having terms as described in the Merger Agreement. 

Following the completion of the First Holding Company Merger, at such time as determined by TD, First Horizon Bank and TD Bank, N.A., a national banking association (&#8220;TDBNA&#8221;) will merge, with TDBNA surviving as a subsidiary of TD-US (the &#8220;Bank Merger&#8221; and together with the Holding Company Mergers, the &#8220;Proposed TD Merger&#8221;).

In connection with the execution of the TD Merger Agreement, TD has agreed to purchase from FHN shares of non-voting Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock, Series G, a new series of preferred stock of FHN (the &#8220;Series G Convertible Preferred Stock&#8221;) in a private placement transaction having an aggregate liquidation preference and purchase price of approximately $493.5 million, pursuant to a securities purchase agreement between FHN and TD entered into concurrently with the execution and delivery of the TD Merger Agreement. The Series G Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible into up to 4.9% of the outstanding shares of Company Common

Competition 

In all aspects of the businesses in which we engage, we face substantial competition from banks doing business in our markets as well as from savings and loan associations, credit unions, other financial institutions, consumer finance companies, trust companies, investment 

counseling firms, money market and other mutual funds, insurance companies and agencies, securities firms, mortgage banking companies, hedge funds, and other firms offering financial products or services. 

Banking Competition 

Our regional banking business primarily competes in those areas within the southern U.S. where we have banking center locations, summarized in Table 1.2. However, competition in our industry is trending away from the traditional geographic footprint model. That trend is happening throughout the industry, but the rate of change is highly uneven among different types of clients, products, and services. In our company, that trend is most evident in our specialty banking segment. 

Our regional banking business serves both consumer and commercial clients. The consumer businesses remain strongly linked to our physical banking center locations, even as our delivery of financial services to consumers is increasingly focused on popular non-physical delivery methods, such as online and mobile banking. Online and mobile banking have contributed to a decline in banking center usage, but not (so far) an erosion of the link between banking center versus consumer client location. Increasingly, however, consumers are able to manage, through a single institution, their financial accounts at multiple institutions. Cross-institutional management features may contribute to a de-linking of consumers to physical banking center networks. 

Our commercial businesses, especially in our specialty banking segment, also have a geographic linkage, but it is weaker. Some areas of specialty lending, such as franchise finance, mortgage warehouse lending, asset-based lending, and certain other specialty businesses (see Fixed Income Competition below) are multi-regional or national in scope rather than being heavily centered on banking center locations. 

Key traditional competitors in many of our markets include Wells Fargo Bank N.A., Bank of America N.A., First- 

Citizens Bank &#38; Trust Company (dba First Citizens Bank), Synovus Bank, Truist Bank, Regions Bank, JPMorgan Chase Bank National Association, PNC Bank National Association, BankUnited, Hancock Whitney Bank, and Pinnacle Bank, among many others including many community banks and credit unions. 

A number of recent technologies created or operated by non-banks have been integrated into the financial systems used by traditional banks, such as the evolution of ATM cards into debit/credit cards and the evolution of debit/credit cards into smart phones. These sorts of incrementally evolutionary technologies often have expanded the market for banking services overall while siphoning a portion of the revenues from those services away from banks. Prior methods of delivering those services were disrupted, but often at a pace which all but the weakest banks could accommodate. 

Recently, some evolutionary pressures have arisen which may prove to be less incremental and more disruptive. For example, in financial planning and wealth management, companies that are not traditional banks, including both long-established firms (such as Vanguard) and new ones (such as Betterment), have developed highly-interactive systems and applications. These services compete directly with traditional banks in offering personal financial advice. The low-cost, high-speed nature of these &#8220;robo-advisor&#8221; services can be especially attractive to younger, less-affluent clients and potential clients. We and other traditional banks offer similar services, but doing so risks cannibalizing traditional business models for these services. 

In recent years, certain financial companies or their affiliates that traditionally were not banks have been able 

##TABLE_START 

&#160; 16 

2021 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT ##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

##TABLE_END

to compete more directly with the Bank for deposits and other traditional banking services and products. Increased fluidity across traditional boundaries is likely to continue. Non-traditional companies competing with us for traditional banking products and services include investment banks, brokerage firms, insurance company affiliates, peer-to-peer lending arrangers, non-bank deposit acceptors, companies offering payment 

facilitation services (such as PayPal and pre-paid debit card issuers), and extremely short-term consumer loan companies. An example of a non-traditional company offering a broad range of financial services is SoFi, an online/mobile company in operation for about a decade, that recently was approved in the U.S. to become a bank. 

Fixed Income Competition 

Our fixed income business, which is part of our specialty banking segment, serves institutional clients, broadly segregated into depositories (including banks, thrifts, and credit unions) and non-depositories (including money managers, insurance companies, governmental units and agencies, public funds, pension funds, and hedge funds). 

Both client groups are widely dispersed geographically, predominantly within the U.S. We have many competitors within both groups, including major U.S. and international securities firms as well as numerous regional and local firms. 

Additional Information About Competition 

For additional information on the competitive position of FHN and the Bank, refer to the General subsection above within this Item 1. Also, refer to the subsections entitled Supervision and Regulation and Effect of Governmental Policies , both of which are relevant to an analysis of our 

competitors. Due to the intense competition in the financial services industry we can make no representation that our competitive position has or will remain constant, nor can we predict how it may change in the future. 

Human Resources Management 

Firstpower Culture 

Our principal business is providing financial services to our clients. Although many financial services can be delivered through technology today, we believe that our clients&#8217; experiences with our associates is a critical way we differentiate from our competitors. Specifically, we ask our associates to take advantage of every opportunity to anticipate client needs and exceed client expectations. 

For this &#8220;differentiated experience&#8221; strategy to succeed, we must build and nurture a diverse and inclusive workplace culture that strives to attract, hire, and retain the best people available by compensating and, just as importantly, treating people fairly; ensure that associates have opportunities for professional growth and advancement within the company; support associates with appropriate workplace resources and training; promote constructive collegiality and a sense of workplace community; encourage innovation and the development of better ways to address business challenges; publicly recognize within the company associate achievements, both great and small; and promote behaviors that provide clients with best-in-class service. At First Horizon, we call that culture &#8220;Firstpower.&#8221; 

We have evolved Firstpower as a part of our MOE to incorporate aspects of both organizations&#8212;expanded expertise, resources and geographic footprint&#8212;into the culture of our company. We have developed the following 

Purpose, Promise and Principles to guide our associates on our core values and philosophies. 

Our Purpose: First Horizon is a relationship-driven leading provider of financial solutions. 

Our Promise: To strengthen the lives of our associates, clients and communities. 

Our Principles: 

&#8226; Great Place To Work &#8211; offer a collaborative and inclusive workplace that promotes associate development, performance and success

Other Business Information 

Strategic Transactions 

An element of our business strategy is to consider acquisitions and divestitures that would enhance long-term shareholder value. Significant acquisitions and divestitures which closed during the past three years are described in Note 2 to our 2021 Financial Statements (Item 8), beginning on page 134 of this report. 

The most significant transactions in the past five years are our merger of equals with IBKC in 2020 and our merger with Capital Bank Financial Corp. in 2017. IBKC&#8217;s assets comprised roughly three-sevenths of our combined assets immediately after closing in July 2020. Capital Bank&#8217;s 

assets comprised roughly one-fourth of our combined assets immediately after closing in November 2017. We completed systems integration for the Capital Bank transaction in 2018, and we completed systems integration with IBKC in February 2022. 

Other significant transactions include our purchase of 30 banking centers in July 2020, with over $2 billion of associated deposits, and our acquisition of Coastal Securities, Inc. in 2017, a leader in trading and securitizing SBA loans.

Client Concentration 

Neither we nor any of our significant subsidiaries is dependent upon a single client or very few clients. 

Calendar-Year Seasonality 

We do not experience material seasonality. We do experience seasonal variation in certain revenues, expenses, and credit trends. Historically, these variations have somewhat increased certain expenses and diminished certain revenues for the regional and specialty banking segments, principally in the first quarter each year. In addition, we experience seasonal variation in certain asset and liability balances, principally in the 

fourth quarter (consumer mortgages, related title services, commercial lending related to consumer mortgages, certain trading balances, and certain associate-related reserves) and first quarter (consumer mortgages, related title services, and commercial lending related to consumer mortgages). 

Cyclicality 

Banking 

Financial services facilitate commercial and consumer economic activities in critical ways. In many key respects, modern financial services make modern types and volumes of economic activity possible. Put simply, we do well when our clients do well, and vice-versa. As a result, our banking business is broadly and strongly dependent on the size and strength of the U.S. economy. 

Generally, when the U.S. economy is in an expansionary phase of the business cycle, our loan balances rise, income from lending tends to rise (assuming static interest rates and margins), credit losses tend to fall, and fee income tends to increase. In a contracting phase, those patterns tend to reverse. The impact of those factors on our operating results can be substantial, especially if they consistently move up or down at the same time. 

Our traditional banking businesses are crucially dependent on the level of interest rates, whether federal monetary policy is easing or tightening, and on the shape of the interest rate yield curve. These factors also are cyclical, and are related in complex ways with the business cycle mentioned above. 

These factors, and their impacts on us, often are mixed rather than consistently positive or negative. For example: low interest rates reduce the interest income we earn, reduce our costs of funding, tend to stimulate economic 

activity and loan growth, and, through lower debt service, tend to ease financial pressure on clients, reducing default risk. If the yield curve remains relatively steep, with long-term interest rates noticeably higher than short rates, our net interest margin will tend not to be significantly compressed by the lower rate environment, since lower short rates will keep our deposit costs down while higher long rates will support the rates we can charge on lending. But if rates fall low enough (as they have in recent years), the yield curve will flatten and our margins will suffer. Moreover, the Federal Reserve tends to lower rates in response to, or to avoid, a weakening economy. Economic weakness tends to diminish client borrowing and other activities which benefit our performance. 

Further information on these topics is presented: within Item 1A (which begins on page 31 ), in Risk from Economic Downturns and Changes , Risks Associated with Monetary Events , Liquidity and Funding Risks , and Interest Rate and Yield Curve Risks ; and, within 2021 MD&#38;A (Item 7), in Executive Overview (page 61 ), Interest Rate Risk Management (page 93 ), and Market Uncertainties and Prospective Trends (page 99 ). 

Fixed Income 

Our fixed income and capital markets business, reported as part of our specialty banking segment, is significantly affected by interest rate cycles which, in turn, are affected by general economic and business cycles. 

##TABLE_START 

&#160; 19 

2021 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT ##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

##TABLE_END

In broad terms, the typical impact of Federal Reserve interest and monetary policy on our fixed income business is summarized in Table 1.8. 

Table 1.8 

Typical Impact of Fed Policy on 

Fixed Income Performance 

##TABLE_START Federal Reserve Policy Phase Tightening Neutral Easing Fixed Income Performance Tends to be Weaker Average Stronger ##TABLE_END

&#8220;Tightening&#8221; can include actions by the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates, raise long-term rates, tighten credit, shrink the money supply, and decelerate economic activity. &#8220;Easing&#8221; can include actions by the Federal Reserve to lower short-term interest rates, lower long-term rates, loosen credit, expand the money supply, and accelerate economic activity. Expectations of policy actions can have impacts similar to the actions themselves. 

In terms of tightening vs. easing, the Federal Reserve policy phase sometimes is clearly known, but sometimes is not. Although Federal Reserve actions at a given time can consistently support one phase, often they are a mix. For example, The Federal Reserve may want to flatten the yield curve by raising short-term rates while lowering long-term rates, or steepen the curve by taking the opposite actions. Also, major exogenous factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, can significantly impact the capital markets and the performance of our fixed income business. In broad terms, these relationships are summarized in Table 1.9. 

Table 1.9 

Key Drivers of 

Fixed Income Performance 

##TABLE_START Driver If Driver Is: FI Revenues Tend to Be: Interest rates Rising Lower Falling Higher Market volatility Low Lower Moderate Higher Yield curve Flatter Lower Steeper Higher Credit spreads Narrower Lower Wider Higher Economy outlook Positive Lower Negative Higher ##TABLE_END

In many circumstances these drivers deliver mixed impacts on fixed income performance, with some pushing higher while others push lower, or with some drivers pushing weakly while others are stronger. If most or all drivers strongly push in the same direction at the same time, fixed income performance usually is strongly impacted. Revenue levels in a strongly &#8220;higher&#8221; year can be more than double what they are in a strongly &#8220;lower&#8221; year. As a result, fixed income performance can be highly variable from year to year. 

Mortgage Origination and Related Services 

The strength of consumer mortgage lending activity in the U.S. impacts three businesses of ours: mortgage origination and related services, title services, and commercial lending to other mortgage lenders. 

Mortgage lending activity is strongly linked to interest rate cycles. Activity tends to be inversely related to prevailing mortgage rates: when rates are high, home-buying and refinancing decrease, and when rates are low, home-buying and refinancing increase. Moreover, expectations about near-term future mortgage rates can accelerate or delay those impacts, as borrowers rush to avoid future rate increases or wait for future rate decreases. 

Market Outlook 

The single most important market factor in 2022 for FHN likely will be when, and to what extent, short-term and long-term interest rates rise from the very low levels seen in 2020 and 2021. A key corollary will be how rate changes affect the shape of the yield curve. Early in 2022, when this report was prepared and filed, long-term rates in the markets have risen modestly in reaction to, and perhaps in anticipation of, Federal Reserve actions. FHN believes it is likely that the Federal Reserve will act to cause long and short rates to rise during the year, though FHN cannot predict the timing or degree of effectiveness of those actions.

Supervision and Regulation 

Scope of this Section 

This section describes certain of the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to bank and financial holding companies and their subsidiaries, and to companies engaged in securities and insurance activities. It also provides certain specific information about us. To the extent that the following information describes 

statutory and regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by express reference to each of the particular statutory and regulatory provisions. A change in applicable statutes, regulations, or regulatory policy may have a material effect on our business. 

Overview 

The Corporation 

First Horizon Corporation is a bank holding company and financial holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the &#8220;BHCA&#8221;), and is registered with the Federal Reserve. We are subject to the regulation and supervision of, and to examination by, the Federal Reserve under the BHCA. We are required to file with the Federal Reserve annual reports and such additional information as the Federal Reserve may require pursuant to the BHCA. 

A bank holding company that is not a financial holding company is limited to engaging in &#8220;banking&#8221; and activities found by the Federal Reserve to be &#8220;closely related to banking.&#8221; Eligible bank holding companies that elect to become financial holding companies may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in a broader range of activities that are &#8220;financial in nature.&#8221; See Financial Activities other than Banking within this Supervision and Regulation discussion below. 

The Federal Reserve may approve an application by a bank holding company to acquire a bank located outside the acquirer&#8217;s principal state of operations without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited under state law, although state law may still impose certain requirements. See Interstate Branching and Mergers and Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;) , both within this Supervision and Regulation discussion below. 

The Tennessee Bank Structure Act of 1974, among other things, prohibits (subject to certain exceptions) a bank holding company from acquiring a bank for which the 

home state is Tennessee (a &#8220;Tennessee bank&#8221;) if, upon consummation, the company would directly or indirectly control 30% or more of the total deposits in insured depository institutions in Tennessee. As of June 30, 2021, the FDIC reports that the Bank held approximately 15% of such deposits. 

The Bank 

First Horizon Bank, our most significant subsidiary, is a Tennessee banking corporation subject to the regulation and supervision of, and to examination by, the TDFI. In addition to general supervision and examination powers, the TDFI has the power to approve mergers with the Bank, the Bank&#8217;s issuance of preferred stock or capital notes, the establishment of banking centers, and many other corporate actions. 

The Bank has chosen to be a member of the Federal Reserve. As a result, the Federal Reserve is the Bank&#8217;s primary federal regulator. As a member, the Bank must buy and hold stock in its district Federal Reserve Bank equal to 6% of the Bank&#8217;s capital stock and surplus. The Bank is paid a dividend on its investment at a rate which varies with ten-year U.S. Treasury rates, capped at 6%. The Bank cannot sell its investment in Federal Reserve Bank stock, and the investment provides the Bank with no control over the Federal Reserve System. 

Tennessee law requires the Bank, as a member of the Federal Reserve, to comply with federal capital and many other regulatory requirements in lieu of, or sometimes in addition to, state requirements. For that reason, this Supervision and Regulation section focuses on federal 

##TABLE_START 

&#160; 21 

2021 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT ##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

##TABLE_END

requirements for many topics related to the Bank, mentioning state requirements only where significant. 

From 1864 until 2019, the Bank was a national banking association subject to the regulation and supervision of, and to examination by, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. In 2019, the Bank converted from a national bank to a Tennessee state bank. Conversion did not significantly alter the scope of the Bank&#8217;s activities: Tennessee law generally allows a Tennessee state bank to take any action that a Tennessee-based national bank could take. 

The Bank is insured by, and subject to regulation by, the FDIC and is subject to regulation in certain respects by the CFPB. The Bank is also subject to various requirements and restrictions under federal and state law, including requirements to maintain reserves against deposits, restrictions on the types and amounts of loans that may be made and the interest that may be charged, limitations on the types of investments that may be made, activities 

that may be engaged in, and types of services that may be offered. Various consumer laws and regulations also affect the operations of the Bank. In addition, several of the Bank&#8217;s subsidiaries are regulated separately, as discussed in Subsidiaries within this Item 1 under the Other Business Information discussion above, which begins on page 18 . 

In addition to the impact of regulation, commercial banks are affected significantly by the actions of the Federal Reserve as it attempts to control interest rates, money supply, and credit availability in order to influence the economy. Also, the Bank and certain of its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with extensions of credit, leases or sales of property, or furnishing products or services. 

The regulatory framework governing banks and the financial industry is intended primarily to protect depositors and the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund, not to protect our Bank or our security holders. 

Regulatory Tiers Based on Asset Size 

Many rules dealing with critical regulatory topics divide banks into tiers based largely or entirely on asset size. Different topics have different cut-off points for the tiers. Within each topic, different rules apply to the different tiers. 

Cut-off points vary significantly. However, as a rough generalization, for many regulatory topics the critical cut-off points are $10 billion, $100 billion, and $250 billion. Companies with less than $10 billion are less regulated in several important ways than we are, and companies with 

$250 billion or more are regulated much more severely in many important ways than we are. As a result, under current law, compliance costs and restrictions grow with size, they tend to change abruptly as a company crosses to the next tier, and we are in a middle tier in many respects. 

The remainder of this Supervision and Regulation discussion focuses on current rules which apply to FHN based on our current asset size. 

Large-Bank Supervision Risk Categories 

Federal regulators have established four risk-based categories for applying enhanced prudential standards (enhanced for larger banks). Category I applies to the global systemically important companies. Categories II, III, and IV apply (with certain exceptions) to institutions with total consolidated assets of at least $700 billion, $250 

billion, and $100 billion, respectively. Currently, we and the Bank are below Category IV&#8217;s floor and therefore, generally, we are not subject to enhanced prudential standards. 

Payment of Dividends 

First Horizon Corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from First Horizon Bank and other subsidiaries. Our principal source of cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends on our stock or to pay principal (including premium, if any) and interest on debt securities, is dividends from the Bank. There are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by the Bank to us, as well as by us to ours shareholders. 

The Corporation 

Under Tennessee corporate law, we are not permitted to pay cash dividends if, after giving effect to such payment, we would not be able to pay our debts as they become 

due in the usual course of business or our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus any amounts needed to satisfy any preferential rights if we were dissolving. In addition, in deciding whether or not to declare a dividend of any particular size, our Board must consider our current and prospective capital, liquidity, and other needs, including the needs of the Bank which we are obligated to support. 

The Bank 

Under Tennessee corporate law, the Bank (like the Corporation, discussed above) may not pay a dividend if the Bank would not be able to pay its debts when due or if 

##TABLE_START 

&#160; 22 

2021 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT ##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

##TABLE_END

the Bank&#8217;s assets would be inadequate, in a dissolution, to pay liabilities and preferential rights. Similarly, the Bank&#8217;s Board must consider current and prospective needs in making a decision to declare a dividend. 

In addition, in order to pay cash dividends, the Bank must obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve and the TDFI Commissioner if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank&#8217;s board of directors in any calendar year exceeds the total of (i) the Bank&#8217;s retained net income for that year plus (ii) the Bank&#8217;s retained net income for the preceding two years, less certain required capital transfers, as applicable. Below that ceiling, approval generally is not required (but see Other Factors Affecting Dividends immediately following this discussion). Applying the dividend restrictions imposed under applicable federal and state rules, the Bank&#8217;s total amount available for dividends, without obtaining regulatory approval, was $ 1.1 billion at January 1, 2022. The application of those restrictions to the Bank is discussed in more detail in the following sections, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1 by reference: under the caption Liquidity Risk Management in our 2021 MD&#38;A (Item 7) beginning on page 95 of this report; and under the caption Restrictions on dividends in Note 13&#8212;Regulatory Capital and Restrictions of our 2021 Financial Statements (Item 8), beginning on page 159 . 

Other Factors Affecting Dividends 

If, in the opinion of the Federal Reserve, we or the Bank are engaged in or about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice (which, depending on the financial condition of FHN or the Bank, could include the payment of dividends), the Federal Reserve may require us or the Bank to cease and desist from that practice. The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution&#8217;s or holding 

company&#8217;s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. 

In addition, under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, an FDIC-insured depository institution (such as the Bank) may not make any capital distributions, pay any management fees to its holding company, or pay any dividend if it is undercapitalized or if such payment would cause it to become undercapitalized. 

The payment of cash dividends by us or by the Bank also may be affected or limited by other factors, such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines and requirements imposed by debt covenants. For example, as discussed under Capital Adequacy within this Supervision and Regulation discussion below, our ability to pay dividends would be restricted if its capital ratios fell below minimum regulatory requirements plus a capital conservation buffer. 

The Federal Reserve generally requires insured banks and bank holding companies to pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. The Federal Reserve has released a supervisory letter advising, among other things, that a bank holding company should inform the Federal Reserve and should eliminate, defer, or significantly reduce its dividends if (i) the bank holding company&#8217;s net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (ii) the bank holding company&#8217;s prospective rate of earnings is not consistent with the bank holding company&#8217;s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or (iii) the bank holding company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. 

Transactions with Affiliates 

The Bank&#8217;s ability to lend or extend credit to its parent company or nonbank subsidiaries (including for purposes of this paragraph, in certain situations, subsidiaries of the Bank) is restricted. The Bank and its subsidiaries generally may not extend credit to us or to any other affiliate in an amount which exceeds 10% of the Bank&#8217;s capital stock and surplus and may not extend credit in the aggregate to us and all such affiliates in an amount which exceeds 20% of its capital stock and surplus. Extensions of credit and other transactions between the Bank and us or such other affiliates must be on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that are substantially the same or at least as favorable to the Bank as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated companies. Further, the type, amount, and quality of 

collateral which must secure such extensions of credit is regulated. 

There are similar legal restrictions on: the Bank&#8217;s purchases of or investments in the securities of and purchases of assets from us or our nonbank subsidiaries; the Bank&#8217;s loans or extensions of credit to third parties collateralized by the securities or obligations of us or our nonbank subsidiaries; the issuance of guaranties, acceptances, and letters of credit on behalf of us or our nonbank subsidiaries; and certain bank transactions with us or our nonbank subsidiaries, or with respect to which we or our nonbank subsidiaries act as agent, participate, or have a financial interest.

Capital Adequacy 

Federal financial industry regulators require that regulated institutions maintain minimum capital levels. The capital rules in the U.S. are based on international standards known as &#8220;Basel III.&#8221; Those U.S. rules require the following: 

&#8226; Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio. For all supervised financial institutions, including us and the Bank, the ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital to risk-weighted assets (&#8220;Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio&#8221;) must be at least 4.5%. To be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio must be at least 6.5%. Common Equity Tier 1 Capital consists of core components of Tier 1 Capital. The core components consist of common stock plus retained earnings net of goodwill, other intangible assets, and certain other required deduction items. At December 31, 2021, our Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 9.92 % and the Bank&#8217;s was 10.75 %. 

&#8226; Tier 1 Capital Ratio. For all supervised financial institutions, including us and the Bank, the ratio of Tier 1 Capital to risk-weighted assets must be at least 6%. To be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; the Tier 1 Capital ratio must be at least 8%. Tier 1 Capital consists of the Tier 1 core components discussed in the bulleted paragraph immediately above, plus non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, a limited amount of minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, and a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock, net of goodwill, other intangible assets, and certain other required deduction items. At December 31, 2021, our Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 11.04 % and the Bank&#8217;s was 11.22 %. 

&#8226; Total Capital Ratio. For all supervised financial institutions, including us and the Bank, the ratio of Total Capital to risk-weighted assets must be at least 8%. To be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; the Total Capital ratios must be at least 10%. At December 31, 2021, our Total Capital Ratio was 12.34 % and the Bank&#8217;s was 12.41 %. 

&#8226; Capital Conservation Buffer. If a capital conservation buffer of an additional 2.5% above the minimum required Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio, Tier 1 Capital ratio, and Total Capital ratio is not maintained, special restrictions would apply to capital distributions, such as dividends and stock repurchases, and on certain compensatory bonuses. 

&#8226; Leverage Ratio&#8212;Base. For all supervised financial institutions, including us or the Bank, the Leverage ratio must be at least 4%. To be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; the Leverage ratio must be at least 5%. The Leverage ratio is Tier 1 Capital divided by quarterly average assets net of goodwill, certain other intangible assets, and certain required deduction items. At December 31, 

2021, our Leverage ratio was 8.08 % and the Bank&#8217;s was 8.20 %. 

&#8226; Leverage Ratio&#8212;Supplemental. For the largest internationally active supervised financial institutions, not including us or the Bank, a minimum supplementary Leverage ratio must be maintained that takes into account certain off-balance sheet exposures. 

We believe that we and the Bank were in compliance with applicable minimum capital requirements as of December 31, 2021. 

Federal regulators have incorporated market and interest-rate risk components into its risk-based capital standards. Those standards explicitly identify concentration of credit risk and certain risks arising from non-traditional activities, and the management of such risks, as important qualitative factors to consider in assessing an institution&#8217;s overall capital adequacy. 

Federal regulators&#8217; market risk rules are applicable to covered institutions&#8212;those with aggregate trading assets and trading liabilities of at least 10% of their total assets or at least $1 billion. We and the Bank are covered institutions under the rule. The rules specify the methodology for calculating the amount of risk-weighted assets related to trading assets and include, among other things, the addition of a component for stressed value at risk. The rule eliminates the use of credit ratings in calculating specific risk capital requirements for certain debt and securitization positions. Alternative standards of creditworthiness are used for specific standardized risks, such as exposures to sovereign debt, public sector entities, other banking institutions, corporate debt, and securitizations. In addition, an 8% capital surcharge applies to certain covered institutions, not including us or the Bank. 

Moreover, the Federal Reserve has indicated that it considers a &#8220;Tangible Tier 1 Capital Leverage Ratio&#8221; (deducting all intangibles) and other indicators of capital strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities. 

Failure to meet capital guidelines could subject a bank to a variety of enforcement remedies, including the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, and to certain restrictions on its business and in certain circumstances to the appointment of a conservator or receiver. See Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) immediately below for additional information. 

In addition, the Bank is required to have a capital structure that the TDFI determines is adequate, based on TDFI&#8217;s assessment of the Bank&#8217;s businesses and risks. The TDFI may require the Bank to increase its capital, if found to be inadequate.

Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) 

Federal banking regulators must take &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; regarding FDIC-insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For this purpose, insured depository institutions are divided into 

five capital categories. The specific requirements applicable to us are summarized in Table 1.10. 

Table 1.10 

REQUIREMENTS FOR PCA CAPITALIZATION CATEGORIES

At December 31, 2021, the Bank had sufficient capital to qualify as &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; under the regulatory capital requirements discussed above. An institution may be deemed to be in a capitalization category that is lower than is indicated by its actual capital position if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating. Institutions generally are not allowed to publicly disclose examination results. 

An FDIC-insured depository institution generally is prohibited from making any capital distribution (including payment of dividends) or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. Undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the Federal Reserve System. In addition, undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans. An insured depository institution&#8217;s holding company must guarantee the capital plan, up to an amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the depository institution&#8217;s assets at the time it becomes 

undercapitalized or the amount of the capital deficiency when the institution fails to comply with the plan, for the plan to be accepted by the applicable federal regulatory authority. The federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution&#8217;s capital. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it were significantly undercapitalized. 

Significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. 

Critically undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator, generally within 90 days of the date on which they become critically undercapitalized. 

Liquidity Coverage Ratio 

The liquidity coverage ratio, or LCR, refers to the amount of liquid assets (cash, cash equivalents, or short-term securities) banks are required to keep on hand to meet a hypothetically projected total net cash outflows over a forward-looking 30-day period of stress. The stressed outflow estimate is based a standard set of hypothetical assumptions set forth in regulatory requirements. The LCR 

is designed to ensure banks hold a buffer of high-quality liquid assets so that they can meet their short-term liquidity needs and remain stable and strong in a stressed environment. Liquid assets generally provide low income levels compared to other investments, so a higher LCR requirement can negatively impact a bank's earnings. 

##TABLE_START 

&#160; 25 

2021 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT ##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

##TABLE_END

The LCR requirement does not apply to institutions with assets of less than $100 billion, and so does not apply to us or the Bank. For larger institutions, the minimum LCR requirement increases based on a bank&#8217;s asset size. 

Category IV banks, with at least $100 billion in assets, are not subject to LCR requirements unless they have at least $50 billion in weighted short-term wholesale funding. 

Holding Company Structure and Support of Subsidiary Banks 

Because we are a holding company, our right to participate in the assets of any subsidiary upon the latter&#8217;s liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary&#8217;s creditors (including depositors in the case of the Bank), except to the extent that we may be a creditor with recognized claims against the subsidiary. In addition, depositors of a bank, and the FDIC as their subrogee, would be entitled to priority over the other creditors in the event of liquidation of the bank. 

Under Federal Reserve policy we are expected to act as a source of financial strength to, and to commit resources to 

support, the Bank. This support may be required at times even if, absent such Federal Reserve policy, we might not wish to provide it. In addition, any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank. In the event of a bank holding company&#8217;s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment. 

Cross-Guarantee Liability 

A depository institution insured by the FDIC can be held liable for any loss incurred by, or reasonably expected to be incurred by, the FDIC in connection with (i) the default of a commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institution or (ii) any assistance provided by the FDIC to any commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institution &#8220;in danger of default.&#8221; &#8220;Default&#8221; is defined generally as the appointment of a conservator or receiver and &#8220;in danger of default&#8221; is defined generally as the existence of certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance. The FDIC&#8217;s claim for damages is superior to claims of shareholders of the insured depository institution or its 

holding company but is subordinate to claims of depositors, secured creditors, and holders of subordinated debt (other than affiliates) of the commonly controlled insured depository institution. 

Currently the Bank is our only depository institution subsidiary. If we were to own or operate another depository institution, any loss suffered by the FDIC in respect of one subsidiary bank would likely result in assertion of the cross-guarantee provisions, the assessment of estimated losses against our other subsidiary bank(s), and a potential loss of our investment in our subsidiary banks. 

Interstate Branching &#38; Mergers 

As mentioned above, the Bank generally must have TDFI&#8217;s approval to establish a new banking center (technically, a &#8220;branch&#8221;). For a new banking center located outside of Tennessee, Tennessee law requires the Bank to comply with branching laws applicable to the state where the new banking center will be located. Federal law allows the Bank to establish or acquire a branch in another state to the same extent as a bank chartered in that other state would be allowed to establish or acquire a branch in Tennessee. 

For an interstate merger or acquisition: the acquiring bank must be well-capitalized and well-managed; concentration limits on liabilities and deposits may not be 

exceeded; regulators must assess the transaction for incremental systemic risk; and the acquiring bank must have at least &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; standing under the federal Community Reinvestment Act (discussed immediately below). 

Once a bank has established branches in a state through de novo or acquired branching or through an interstate merger transaction, the bank may then establish or acquire additional branches within that state to the same extent that a bank chartered in that state is allowed to establish or acquire branches within the state. 

Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;) 

The CRA requires each U.S. bank, consistent with safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of each community where the bank accepts deposits, including low- and moderate-income (&#8220;LMI&#8221;) communities. The Federal Reserve assesses the Bank periodically for CRA 

compliance, and that assessment is made public. The Bank&#8217;s LMI operations and activities traditionally are critical focal points in those assessments. 

A CRA rating below &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; can slow or halt a bank&#8217;s plans to expand by branching, acquisition, or merger, and 

##TABLE_START 

&#160; 26 

2021 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT ##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

##TABLE_END

can prevent a bank holding company from becoming a financial holding company. In its most recent CRA assessment, for 2020, the Bank received ratings of "High 

Satisfactory" in Lending and in Service, "Outstanding" in Investment, and "Satisfactory" overall. 

Financial Activities other than Banking 

Federal Law 

Federal law generally allows financial holding companies broad authority to engage in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity. These include: insurance underwriting and brokerage; merchant banking; securities underwriting, dealing, and market-making; real estate development; and such additional activities as the Federal Reserve in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury determines to be financial in nature or incidental. A bank holding company may engage in these activities directly or through subsidiaries by qualifying as a &#8220;financial holding company.&#8221; To qualify as a financial holding company, a bank holding company must file an initial declaration with the Federal Reserve, certifying that all of its subsidiary depository institutions are well-managed and well-capitalized. 

Federal law also permits banks to engage in certain of these activities through financial subsidiaries. To control or hold an interest in a financial subsidiary, a bank must meet the following requirements: 

(1) The bank must receive approval from its primary federal regulator for the financial subsidiary to engage in the activities. 

(2) The bank and its depository institution affiliates must each be well-capitalized and well-managed. 

(3) The aggregate consolidated total assets of all of the bank&#8217;s financial subsidiaries must not exceed the lesser of: 45% of the bank&#8217;s consolidated total assets; or $50 billion (subject to indexing for inflation). 

(4) The bank must have in place adequate policies and procedures to identify and manage financial and operational risks and to preserve the separate identities and limited liability of the bank and the financial subsidiary. 

(5) If the bank is among the 100 largest banks, the bank must meet the long-term debt rating or alternative 

standards adopted by the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury from time to time. If this fifth requirement ceases to be met after a bank controls or holds an interest in a financial subsidiary, the bank cannot invest additional capital in that subsidiary until the requirement again is met. 

No new activity may be commenced unless the bank and all of its depository institution affiliates have at least &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; CRA ratings. Certain restrictions apply if the bank holding company or the bank fails to continue to meet one or more of the requirements listed above. 

In addition, federal law contains a number of other provisions that may affect the Bank&#8217;s operations, including limitations on the use and disclosure to third parties of client information. 

At December 31, 2021, we are a financial holding company and the Bank has a number of financial subsidiaries, as discussed in Subsidiaries within this Item 1 under the Other Business Information discussion, which begins on page 18 . 

Tennessee Law 

Tennessee law does not expressly restrict the activities of a bank holding company or its non-bank affiliates. However, no Tennessee bank may maintain a branch office on the premises of an affiliate if the affiliate is engaged in activities that are not permissible for a bank holding company, a financial holding company, a national bank, or a national bank subsidiary under federal law. Tennessee law permits Tennessee banks to establish subsidiaries and to engage in any activities permissible for a national bank located in Tennessee, subject to compliance with Tennessee regulations relating to the conduct of such activities for the purpose of maintaining bank safety and soundness. 

Interchange Fee Restrictions 

Regulations severely cap interchange fees which the Bank may charge merchants for debit card transactions. 

Volcker Rule 

The Volcker rule (1) generally prohibits banks from engaging in proprietary trading, which is engaging as principal (for the bank&#8217;s own account) in any purchase or sale of one or more of certain types of financial 

instruments, and (2) limits banks&#8217; ability to invest in or sponsor hedge funds or private equity funds.

Consumer Regulation by the CFPB 

The CFPB adopts and administers significant rules affecting consumer lending and consumer financial services. Key rules for the Bank include detailed regulation of mortgage servicing practices and detailed regulation of mortgage origination and underwriting practices. The latter rules, among other things, establish the definition of 

a &#8220;qualified mortgage&#8221; using traditional underwriting practices involving down payments, credit history, income levels and verification, and so forth. The rules do not prohibit, but do tend to discourage, lenders from originating non-qualified mortgages. 

Data Security &#38; Portability 

Security &#38; Privacy 

Federal law requires banks to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative, technical, and physical safeguards. Banks are required to have appropriate data governance practices and risk management processes as key functions supporting its operational resilience. 

Data privacy and protection increasingly is a significant legislative, regulatory, and societal concern. The concern is driven by major technological and societal shifts in the past 20 years, led by relatively unregulated firms such as Amazon.com, Alibaba, Facebook, and Google and their many clients worldwide. Those firms have gathered large amounts of personal details about millions of people, and today have the ability to analyze that data and act on that analysis very quickly. These firms seek to understand enough about a person to know what a person wants before the person does. 

Banks (as mentioned above) already are subject to significant privacy regulations. Probably for that reason, the banking industry is not at the political center of these concerns today. Even so, banks are likely to be affected by broader legislative and regulatory responses to the perceived problems. Two prominent responses to date 

include the European Union General Data Protection Regulation and the California Data Privacy Protection Act. Neither is a banking industry regulation, but both apply to banks in relation to certain clients. To date, neither has had a material impact on the Bank. 

Portability &#38; Client Control 

Federal law restricts the Bank&#8217;s ability to share certain information with affiliates and non-affiliates for marketing and/or non-marketing purposes, or to contact clients with marketing offers. Affiliate and non-affiliate sharing initiated by the Bank generally is permitted with client consent. 

Increasingly, banks are being required to permit, enable, and support client control of client data, including the sharing of client data with Bank affiliates and with outside organizations. These requirements, which still are evolving, are intended to foster data portability for clients and greater competition among financial services firms. However, they also significantly increase data security risks because they create additional access channels for bad actors to try to exploit, or they make accessing existing channels easier or faster. 

FDIC Insurance Assessments; DIFA 

U.S. bank deposits generally are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;), administered by the FDIC. The system of FDIC insurance premium rates charged consists of a rate grid structure in which base rates range from 5 to 35 basis points annually, and fully adjusted rates range from 2.5 to 45 basis points annually. (A basis point is equal to 0.01%.) Key factors in the grid include: the institution&#8217;s risk category (I to IV); whether the institution is deemed large and highly complex; whether the institution qualifies for an unsecured debt adjustment; and whether the institution is burdened with a brokered deposit 

adjustment. Other factors can impact the base against which the applicable rate is applied, including (for example) whether a net loss is realized. 

Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order, or condition imposed by a federal bank regulatory agency. 

Depositor Preference 

Federal law provides that deposits and certain claims for administrative expenses and associate compensation against an insured depository institution would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims 

against such an institution, including federal funds and letters of credit, in the &#8220;liquidation or other resolution&#8221; of such an institution by any receiver.

Securities Regulation 

Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to various securities laws and regulations and capital adequacy requirements promulgated by the regulatory and exchange authorities of the jurisdictions in which they operate. 

Our registered broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the SEC&#8217;s net capital rule, Rule 15c3-1. That rule requires the maintenance of minimum net capital and limits the ability of the broker-dealer to transfer large amounts of capital to a parent company or affiliate. Compliance with 

the rule could limit operations that require intensive use of capital, such as underwriting and trading. 

Certain of our subsidiaries are registered investment advisers which are regulated under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Advisory contracts with clients automatically terminate under these laws upon an assignment of the contract by the investment adviser unless appropriate consents are obtained. 

Insurance Activities 

Certain of our subsidiaries sell various types of insurance as agent in a number of states. Insurance activities are subject to regulation by the states in which such business is transacted. Although most of such regulation focuses on insurance companies and their insurance products, 

insurance agents and their activities are also subject to regulation by the states, including, among other things, licensing and marketing and sales practices. 

Compensation &#38; Risk Management 

The Federal Reserve has issued guidance intended to ensure that incentive compensation arrangements at financial organizations take into account risk and are consistent with safe and sound practices. The guidance is based on three &#8220;key principles&#8221; calling for incentive compensation plans to: appropriately balance risks and rewards; be compatible with effective controls and risk management; and be backed up by strong corporate governance. In response: we operate an enhanced risk management process for assessing risk in incentive compensation plans; several key incentive programs use a net profit approach rather than a revenues-only approach; and mandatory deferral features are used in several key programs, including an executive program. 

In 2016 federal agencies proposed regulations which could significantly change the regulation of incentive compensation programs at financial institutions. The 

proposal would create four tiers of institutions based on asset size. Institutions in the top two tiers would be subject to rules much more detailed and proscriptive than are currently in effect. If interpreted aggressively by the regulators, the proposed rules could be used to prevent, as a practical matter, larger institutions from engaging in certain lines of business where substantial commission and bonus pool arrangements are the norm. In the 2016 proposal, the top two tiers included institutions with more than $50 billion of assets. We and the Bank currently would fall into the lower of those top two tiers. However, prompted by post-2016 legislation which significantly raised several statutory asset-size tiers, if this proposal were finalized today, the $50 billion floor might be raised significantly, allowing us to remain in the third tier. We cannot predict what final rules may be adopted, nor how they may be implemented. 

Effect of Government Policies &#38; Proposals 

The Bank is affected by the policies of regulatory authorities, including the Federal Reserve, the TDFI, and the CFPB. See Supervision and Regulation beginning on page 21 for additional information. 

The Federal Reserve also sets and manages monetary policy for the U.S. In this latter role, the Federal Reserve&#8217;s mandate from Congress is to pursue price stability and full employment. 

Among the instruments of monetary policy used by the Federal Reserve are: purchases and sales of U.S. government and other securities in the marketplace; changes in the discount rate, which is the rate any depository institution must pay to borrow from the Federal Reserve; changes in the reserve requirements of 

depository institutions; changes in the rate paid on banks&#8217; required and excess reserve deposits at the Federal Reserve; and changes in the federal funds rate, which is the rate at which depository institutions lend balances to each other overnight. These instruments are intended to influence economic and monetary growth, interest rate levels, and inflation. 

The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve and other governmental policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. Because of changing conditions in the national and international economies and in the money markets, as well as the result of actions by monetary and fiscal authorities, it is not possible to predict with certainty future changes in 

##TABLE_START

##TABLE_END

interest rates, deposit levels, loan demand, or the business and results of our operations, or whether changing economic conditions will have a positive or negative effect on operations and earnings. Additional information concerning monetary policy changes appears: under the caption Monetary Policy Shifts within the Significant Business Developments section of Item 1, which begins on page 12 ; under the caption Risks Associated with Monetary Events beginning on page 38 within Item 1A; and under the caption Federal Reserve Policy in Transition within the Market Uncertainties and Prospective Trends section of our 2021 MD&#38;A (Item 7), which begins on page 99 . 

Bills occasionally are introduced in the United States Congress, the Tennessee General Assembly and other state legislatures, and regulations occasionally are proposed by our regulatory agencies, any of which could affect our businesses, financial results, and financial condition. 

We are not able to predict what, if any, changes that Congress, state legislatures, or the regulatory agencies will enact or implement in the future, nor the impact that those actions will have upon us. 

Sources &#38; Availability of Funds 

Information concerning the sources and availability of funds for our businesses can be found in our 2021 MD&#38;A (Item 7), including the subsection entitled Liquidity Risk Management beginning on page 95 , which material is incorporated herein by reference.
