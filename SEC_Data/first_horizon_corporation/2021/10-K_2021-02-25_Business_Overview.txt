##TABLE_START Our Businesses ##TABLE_END

First Horizon Corporation is a Tennessee corporation. We incorporated in 1968, and are headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee. We are a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act, and a financial holding company under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol &#8220;FHN.&#8221; In 2020 we shortened our corporate name, which had been First Horizon National Corporation for many years. At December 31, 2020, we had total consolidated assets of $84 billion. We provide diversified financial services primarily through our principal subsidiary, First Horizon Bank. The Bank is a Tennessee banking corporation headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee. 

During 2020 approximately 47% of our consolidated revenues were provided by fee and other noninterest income, and approximately 53% of revenues were provided by net interest income. 

As a financial holding company, we coordinate the financial resources of the consolidated enterprise and maintain systems of financial, operational, and administrative control intended to coordinate selected policies and activities, including as described in Item 9A of Part II. 

The Bank 

The Bank was founded in 1864 as First National Bank of Memphis. During 2020, through its various business lines, including consolidated subsidiaries, the Bank reported revenues (net interest income plus noninterest income) of approximately $3.2 billion. The Bank generated a substantial majority of First Horizon&#8217;s consolidated revenue. At December 31, 2020, the Bank had $84 billion in total assets, $71 billion in total deposits, and $58 billion in total loans and leases (net of unearned income and net of reserves for credit losses). 

Business Segments 

Our financial results of operations are reported through operational business segments which are not closely related to the legal structure of our subsidiaries. As a result of our recent merger of equals with IBERIABANK Corporation (see Significant Business Developments over Past Five Years starting on page 10 below), in 2020 we changed our segments. Before the merger, we operated through four business segments: regional banking, fixed income, corporate, and non-strategic. By the end of 2020 and going forward, we operate through three segments: regional banking, specialty banking, and corporate. Quarterly results in 2020 were reported originally using the previous segments, while fourth-quarter and full-year results are reported using the current segments. In this report, segment information related to prior periods has been reclassified to conform with the current segments. 

Financial and other additional information concerning our segments&#8212;including information concerning assets, revenues, and financial results&#8212;appears in our 2020 MD&#38;A (Item 7) and Note 20 to our 2020 Financial Statements (Item 8). 

Principal Businesses and Brands 

As a result of our recent merger of equals with IBERIABANK Corporation (see Significant Business Developments over Past Five Years starting on page 10 below), at year-end 2020 many of our principal businesses were conducted primarily under two or more brands. Once conversion and integration of our two companies is completed, we expect to simplify our branding, phasing out certain brands over time. Our principal brands at year-end are summarized in Table 1.1.

Physical Business Locations 

At December 31, 2020, First Horizon&#8217;s subsidiaries had well over 500 business locations in 23 U.S. states, excluding off-premises ATMs. Most of those locations were banking centers. At year-end, First Horizon had 492 banking centers in twelve states:

##TABLE_START State # State # Tennessee 165 Georgia 12 Florida 97 South Carolina 11 North Carolina 89 Texas 10 Louisiana 64 Virginia 8 Arkansas 16 Mississippi 5 Alabama 14 New York 1 ##TABLE_END

Many banking centers contain special-service areas such as wealth management and mortgage lending. At year-end, First Horizon also had client-service offices not physically within banking centers, including fixed income, title services, home mortgage, wealth management, and commercial loan offices. The largest groups of those offices were: 29 fixed income offices in eighteen states across the U.S.; 29 title services offices in Arkansas, Tennessee, and Louisiana; and 15 stand-alone mortgage lending offices in seven states. First Horizon also has operational and administrative offices. 

Loans &#38; Deposits 

Lending and deposit-taking are core businesses for us. Our largest resource to fund our lending is our deposit base. At year-end 2020, we had total loans (net of unearned income) of $58 billion, total net loans (net of unearned income and net of reserves for credit losses) of $57 billion, and total deposits of $70 billion. 

Most of our loans and deposits are held in our regional banking and specialty banking segments. Most of our loans are commercial, and most of them are traditional, unsecured commercial, financial, and industrial loans, or &#8220;C&#38;I&#8221; loans. The other two major loan portfolios are secured commercial real estate loans, or &#8220;CRE&#8221; loans, and secured consumer real estate loans. Table 1.3 provides an overview of our loan and deposit balances at December 31, 2020 or averaged over the year 2020.

##TABLE_START Significant Business Developments Over Past Five Years ##TABLE_END

Over the past five years, our strategic priorities have focused on: 

&#8226; targeted expansion of consumer and commercial banking products and markets; 

&#8226; opportunistic expansion of commercial lending, mainly through acquisition transactions, talent development, and talent acquisitions; 

&#8226; rigorous expense management with continued investment in revenue generating initiatives; 

&#8226; managing business units and products with a strong emphasis on risk-adjusted returns on invested capital; 

&#8226; providing exceptional client experience as a primary means to differentiate us from competitors; and 

&#8226; investment in scalable technology and other infrastructure to attract and retain clients and to support expansion. 

Examples of our implementation of these priorities include: 

&#8226; In July 2020, we completed a merger of equals transaction with IBERIABANK Corporation and purchased 30 branches from Truist Bank, making 2020 a transformative year. See IBKC Merger of Equals and 30-Branch Acquisition in this Item below for additional information. 

##TABLE_START 

FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION 

&#160; 10 

2020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT ##TABLE_END

&#8226; As mentioned below, the COVID-19 pandemic caused us to recognize substantial provision for credit loss in 2020, and reduced our transaction volume and revenues. See CECL Accounting and COVID-19 beginning on page 12 of this Item 1. However, when the federal government created the Paycheck Protection Program (&#8220;PPP&#8221;) in the second quarter of 2020, legacy First Horizon and legacy IBKC each were able to help clients obtain $2 billion of PPP loans (more than $4 billion total) over the course of a few short weeks. In doing so, we helped our clients access financial relief to sustain their businesses during the economic downturn. We received significant positive feedback from affected clients and earned origination fees from the PPP, $15 million of which we donated to help low and moderate income communities. 

&#8226; In 2017 we merged with Capital Bank Financial Corp., which had $10 billion of total assets and nearly 200 banking centers in four southern U.S. states. 

&#8226; Other acquisitions during this period include: a national leader in trading, securitization, and analysis of Small Business Association loans 

(2017); and a significant restaurant franchise finance business and portfolio (2016). 

&#8226; We have made key talent hires in critical areas throughout our company, with the main focus on organically growing economically profitable business lines inside and outside our traditional markets. 

&#8226; We have pruned and adapted our physical banking center network to reflect long-term trends in client usage of banking centers, and are making more efficient use of other physical facilities. Correspondingly, we have expanded and enhanced our digital banking products and services. 

&#8226; Organic commercial loan growth has been strong in specialty lending areas, such as lending to mortgage companies, where margins tend to be better but outstanding balances tend to fluctuate seasonally and cyclically.

Events Impacting Year-to-Year Comparisons 

IBKC Merger of Equals in 2020 

In July 2020, we closed our merger of equals with IBERIABANK Corporation (&#8220;IBKC&#8221;). IBKC was the parent company of IBERIABANK based in Lafayette, Louisiana. At year-end 2019, IBKC had $31.7 billion of total assets&#8212;nearly 75% of our size at that time&#8212;and operated over 190 banking centers in 11 states: Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, North and South Carolina, and New York. IBKC&#8217;s largest concentrations of banking centers were in Louisiana and Florida. We and IBKC offered many of the same financial services 

before the merger, but IBKC exceeded us in several areas, most notably in equipment financing, mortgage, and title services. 

After closing, our board expanded to 17 directors, of which nine are from legacy First Horizon and eight are from legacy IBKC. IBKC shareholders collectively were issued 243 million First Horizon common shares (on a net basis), or 44% of our common shares outstanding at year-end 2020. 

Under applicable accounting guidance, none of the income or expense recognized by IBKC prior to the merger is included in our income or expense for 2020. As a result, our 2020 operating results 

##TABLE_START 

FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION 

&#160; 11 

2020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT ##TABLE_END

essentially consist of two quarters of legacy First Horizon plus two quarters of combined First Horizon and IBKC. In addition, operating results in 2020 were significantly affected by merger-related expenses and by two significant accounting impacts, described in Large Accounting Impacts from IBKC Merger below. 

30-Branch Acquisition in 2020 

In July 2020, we purchased 30 branches in North Carolina (20), Virginia (8), and Georgia (2) from SunTrust Bank (now Truist Bank). Those branches are in markets which we did not serve before July, or in which we did not have a leading market position. Along with the branch facilities, we acquired $0.4 billion of related loans and assumed $2.2 billion of deposits. 

Large Accounting Impacts from IBKC Merger 

Under applicable accounting guidance, closing the IBKC merger in July created two substantial impacts on our operating results for 2020. First, although we were required to record IBKC&#8217;s loans at fair value on the closing date, we also were required to recognize, as credit provision expense, an estimate of current expected credit losses for certain acquired loans. A similar process, with much smaller numbers, occurred for the loans associated with the 30-branch purchase. The overall incremental expense, recorded in third quarter 2020, was $147 million. Moreover, we were required to record, on a preliminary basis, a nontaxable purchase accounting gain from the merger of $533 million, driven by the stock market decline in 2020 associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The net result of those two impacts was a $386 million uplift to our pretax income in 2020 unrelated to the ordinary operation of our businesses. 

Expenses related to IBKC Merger 

Closing the IBKC merger, integrating the business operations and systems, and making the changes necessary to achieve intended cost and other synergies, resulted in noninterest expenses in 2020 in excess of $140 million. Additional significant expenses related to integration and optimization will be incurred in 2021. 

Low Credit Loss Rates through 2019 

During 2016-2019, our provision for credit losses was unusually low, though in 2019 it began to normalize. When provision is low, differences from year to year can be idiosyncratic, driven by just a few clients. 

CECL Accounting and COVID-19 

Starting in 2020, accounting guidance changed, requiring us to recognize &#8220;current expected credit loss&#8221; on all loans. The new guidance had the effect of accelerating, compared to prior guidance, the recognition of provision expense at times when general economic conditions deteriorate in a rapid manner. Starting in March 2020, government and 

public reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic caused substantial and rapid, and previously unexpected, business disruption and economic deterioration. Those events substantially changed our expectations for future credit loss in the first half of 2020 and, accordingly, our provision expense was significantly elevated. Later in 2020, a positive change in expectations partially moderated that impact. Moreover, the new guidance was not applied retroactively to prior years, making year-to-year comparisons of provision expense less useful. 

Fixed Income Volatility 

For several of these years, market conditions were quite subdued for our fixed income business. Starting in 2019, however, increased market volatility and the downward direction of interest rates resulted in much higher trading volume and noninterest income in that business. See Cyclicality&#8212;Fixed Income in this Item, beginning on page 16, for additional information. 

Sale of Visa Class B Stock in 2018 

In 2018, we sold our remaining legacy stock holdings of Visa, significantly increasing noninterest income that year. 

Capital Bank Merger in 2017 

Many year-end balance sheet figures (loans, deposits, etc.) increased substantially in 2017 due to the Capital Bank transaction. Full-year operating results were less noticeably impacted until 2018, because the Capital Bank transaction closed late in 2017. 

Tax Reform in 2017 

Corporate tax reform in December 2017 resulted in significant negative adjustments to net deferred tax asset balance, driving a large net loss in fourth quarter that year. Financial results after 2017, in contrast, benefited significantly from lower tax rates compared to earlier years. 

Monetary Policy Shifts 

Although interest rates during each of these years were quite low by historical standards, short-term rates were raised modestly starting in 2015 and more vigorously in 2018. Short-term rates were reduced in 2019 and again in 2020, the latter in response to the pandemic. Other actions by the Federal Reserve put downward pressure on long-term interest rates as well, especially in 2020. These changes impacted our net interest margin, raising and lowering it over this period. Net interest margin is a measure of the profit we make on loans and other earning assets in relation to our cost of deposits and other funding sources. Because funding costs cannot realistically fall below zero, the very low rate environment during 2020 resulted in historically low net interest margin levels for us.

FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION

2020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT ##TABLE_END

Trends 

Noteworthy trends during this period include: 

&#8226; Net loan growth in 2019 (vs. 2018) was purely organic. Organic loan growth occurred in other years as well, but was masked by merger and acquisition transactions. 

&#8226; Growth in net interest income was significant through 2018, driven by net loan growth, interest rate increases, and (in 2018) the Capital Bank merger. Growth flattened in 2019 as net loan growth, especially in mortgage warehouse lending, was offset by net interest margin declines. Margin declines continued in 2020, but loans increased substantially with the IBERIABANK merger. 

&#8226; In 2016 and 2017, an overall down-trend in noninterest income was due mainly to lower fixed income revenues, driven by challenging market conditions. The large increase in 2018 was mainly due to the Visa stock sale, along with an uptick following the Capital Bank merger. The 2016-17 trend reversed in 2019, and continued in 2020, as interest rates declined, market volatility increased, and fixed income revenues improved markedly. Also, the second half of 2020 enjoyed a substantial increase in noninterest income following the IBERIABANK merger, especially in relation to consumer mortgage originations and related services. 

&#8226; The large deposit upticks in 2017 and 2020 were driven substantially by the Capital Bank, IBERIABANK, and 30-branch transactions. Also in 

2020, the federal Paycheck Protection Program (&#8220;PPP&#8221;) contributed to deposit growth as proceeds from PPP loans boosted average deposit account balances. Organic growth in deposits from core banking clients grew throughout this period, even in 2019 and 2020 when interest rates were extremely low. That core growth is masked in some years by deliberate reductions in (more expensive) market-indexed deposits, and in other years by those large transactions. 

&#8226; Throughout 2020, economic and business disruption related to the COVID-19 pandemic created substantial challenges for our clients and for our company. Disruption peaked in the spring, diminished significantly in the summer, and resumed in the autumn and winter. Although at some future point significant disruption from the pandemic will end, we are not able to predict with confidence which pre-pandemic trends will resume and which will end or change. 

Exited Businesses 

Over the past decade, we have focused on traditional banking and fixed income products and services. We exited our legacy nation-wide mortgage banking business in 2008, though we continue to manage related legal exposures and the wind-down of a related loan portfolio. We have partially or fully exited other businesses as well. Exited businesses are managed in our corporate segment currently, and were managed in our non-strategic segment in prior periods. 

##TABLE_START Competition ##TABLE_END

In all aspects of the businesses in which we engage, we face substantial competition from banks doing business in our markets as well as from savings and loan associations, credit unions, other financial institutions, consumer finance companies, trust companies, investment counseling firms, money market and other mutual funds, insurance companies and agencies, securities firms, mortgage banking companies, hedge funds, and other firms offering financial products or services. 

Banking 

Our regional banking business primarily competes in those areas within the southern U.S. where we have banking center locations. However, competition in our industry is trending away from the traditional geographic footprint model. That trend is happening throughout the industry, but the rate of change is highly uneven among different types of clients, products, and services. 

Our regional banking business serves both consumer and commercial clients. The consumer businesses remain strongly linked to our physical banking center locations, even as our delivery of financial services to consumers is increasingly focused on popular non-physical delivery methods, such as online and mobile banking. Online and mobile banking have contributed to a decline in banking center usage, but not (so far) an erosion of the link between banking center versus consumer client location. Increasingly, however, consumers are able to manage, through a single institution, their financial accounts at multiple institutions. If cross-institutional management features become popular, they may hasten a de-linking of consumers to physical banking center networks. 

Our commercial businesses, especially in our specialty banking segment, also have a geographic linkage, but it is weaker. Some areas of specialty lending, such franchise finance, and certain other specialty businesses (see Fixed Income below) are 

##TABLE_START 

FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION 

&#160; 13 

2020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT ##TABLE_END

multi-regional or national in scope rather than being heavily centered on banking center locations. 

Key traditional competitors in many of our markets include Wells Fargo Bank N.A., Bank of America N.A., First-Citizens Bank &#38; Trust Company ( dba First Citizens Bank), Synovus Bank, Truist Bank, Regions Bank, JPMorgan Chase Bank National Association, PNC Bank National Association, BankUnited, Hancock Whitney Bank, and Pinnacle Bank, among many others including many community banks and credit unions. 

A number of recent technologies created or operated by non-banks have been integrated into the financial systems used by traditional banks, such as the evolution of ATM cards into debit/credit cards and the evolution of debit/credit cards into smart phones. These sorts of incrementally evolutionary technologies often have expanded the market for banking services overall while siphoning a portion of the revenues from those services away from banks. Prior methods of delivering those services were disrupted, but often at a pace which all but the weakest banks could accommodate. 

Recently, some evolutionary pressures have arisen which may prove to be less incremental and more disruptive. For example, in financial planning and wealth management, companies that are not traditional banks, including both long-established firms (such as Vanguard) and new ones (such as Betterment), have developed highly-interactive systems and applications. These services compete directly with traditional banks in offering personal financial advice. The low-cost, high-speed nature of these &#8220;robo-advisor&#8221; services can be especially attractive to younger, less-affluent clients and potential clients. We and other traditional banks offer similar services, but doing so risks cannibalizing traditional business models for these services. 

In recent years, certain financial companies or their affiliates that traditionally were not banks have been 

able to compete more directly with the Bank for deposits and other traditional banking services and products. Increased fluidity across traditional boundaries is likely to continue. Non-traditional companies competing with us for traditional banking products and services include investment banks, brokerage firms, insurance company affiliates, peer-to-peer lending arrangers, non-bank deposit acceptors, companies offering payment facilitation services (such as PayPal and pre-paid debit card issuers), and extremely short-term consumer loan companies. 

Fixed Income 

Our fixed income business, which is part of our specialty banking segment, serves institutional clients, broadly segregated into depositories (including banks, thrifts, and credit unions) and non-depositories (including money managers, insurance companies, governmental units and agencies, public funds, pension funds, and hedge funds). Both client groups are widely dispersed geographically, predominantly within the U.S. We have many competitors within both groups, including major U.S. and international securities firms as well as numerous regional and local firms. 

Additional Information 

For additional information on the competitive position of FHN and the Bank, refer to the &#8220;General&#8221; subsection above within this Item 1. Also, refer to the subsections entitled Supervision and Regulation and Effect of Governmental Policies , both of which are relevant to an analysis of our competitors. Due to the intense competition in the financial services industry we can make no representation that our competitive position has or will remain constant, nor can we predict how it may change in the future. 

##TABLE_START Other General Information ##TABLE_END

Strategic Transactions 

An element of our business strategy is to consider acquisitions and divestitures that would enhance long-term shareholder value. Significant acquisitions and divestitures which closed during the past three years are described in Note 2 to our 2020 Financial Statements (Item 8). 

The most significant transactions in the past five years are our merger of equals with IBKC in 2020 and our merger with Capital Bank Financial Corp. in 2017. IBKC&#8217;s assets comprised roughly three-sevenths of our combined assets immediately after closing in July 2020. Capital Bank&#8217;s assets comprised roughly one- 

fourth of our combined assets immediately after closing in November 2017. We completed systems integration for the Capital Bank transaction in 2018, and we expect to complete integration with IBKC in the second half of 2021. 

Other significant transactions include our purchase of 30 banking centers in July 2020, with over $2 billion of associated deposits, and our acquisition of Coastal Securities, Inc. in 2017, a leader in trading and securitizing SBA loans.

Client Concentration 

Neither we nor any of our significant subsidiaries is dependent upon a single client or very few clients. 

Calendar-Year Seasonality 

We do not experience material seasonality. We do experience seasonal variation in certain revenues, expenses, and credit trends. Historically, these variations have somewhat increased certain expenses and diminished certain revenues for the regional and specialty banking segments, principally in the first quarter each year. In addition, we experience seasonal variation in certain asset and liability balances, principally in the fourth quarter 

(consumer mortgages, related title services, commercial lending related to consumer mortgages, certain trading balances, and certain associate-related reserves) and first quarter (consumer mortgages, related title services, and commercial lending related to consumer mortgages). 

Cyclicality 

Banking 

Financial services facilitate commercial and consumer economic activities in critical ways. In many key respects, modern financial services make modern types and volumes of economic activity possible. Put more simply, we do well when our clients do well, and vice-versa . As a result, our banking business is broadly and strongly dependent on the size and strength of the U.S. economy. 

Generally, when the U.S. economy is in an expansionary phase of the business cycle, our loan balances rise, income from lending tends to rise (assuming static interest rates), credit losses tend to fall, and fee income tends to increase. In a contracting phase, those patterns tend to reverse. The impact of those factors on our operating results can be substantial, especially if they consistently move up or down at the same time. 

Our traditional banking businesses are crucially dependent on the level of interest rates, whether federal monetary policy is easing or tightening, and on the shape of the interest rate yield curve. These factors also are cyclical, and are related in complex ways with the business cycle mentioned above. 

These factors, and their impacts on us, often are mixed rather than consistently positive or negative. For example: low interest rates reduce the interest income we earn, reduce our costs of funding, tend to stimulate economic activity and loan growth, and, through lower debt service, tend to ease financial pressure on clients, reducing default risk. If the yield curve remains relatively steep, with long-term interest rates noticeably higher than short rates, our net interest margin will tend not to be significantly compressed by the lower rate environment, since lower short rates will keep our deposit costs down while higher long rates will support the rates we can charge on lending. But if rates fall low enough (as they have in recent years), the yield curve will flatten and our margins will suffer. Moreover, the Federal Reserve tends to lower rates in response to, or to avoid, a weakening economy. Economic weakness tends to diminish client borrowing and other activities which benefit our performance. 

Further information on these topics is presented: within Item 1A, in Risk from Economic Downturns and Changes (p. 31), Risks Associated with Monetary Events (p. 31), Liquidity and Funding Risks (p. 39), and Interest Rate and Yield Curve Risks (p. 40); and,

Fixed Income 

Our fixed income and capital markets business, reported as part of our specialty banking segment, is significantly affected by interest rate cycles which, in turn, are affected by general economic and business cycles. 

In broad terms, the typical impact of Federal Reserve interest and monetary policy on our fixed income business is summarized in Table 1.7. 

Table 1.7 

Fed Policy Impact on 

Fixed Income Performance 

##TABLE_START Federal Reserve Policy Phase Tightening Neutral Easing Fixed Income Performance Tends to be Weaker Average Stronger ##TABLE_END

&#8220;Tightening&#8221; can include actions by the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates, raise long-term rates, tighten credit, shrink the money supply, and decelerate economic activity. &#8220;Easing&#8221; can include actions by the Federal Reserve to lower short-term interest rates, lower long-term rates, loosen credit, expand the money supply, and accelerate economic activity. Expectations of policy actions can have impacts similar to the actions themselves. 

In terms of tightening vs. easing, the Federal Reserve policy phase sometimes is clearly known, but sometimes is not. Although Federal Reserve actions at a given time can consistently support one phase, often they are a mix. For example, The Federal Reserve may want to flatten the yield curve by raising short-term rates while lowering long-term rates, or steepen the curve by taking the opposite actions. Also, major exogenous factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, can significantly impact the capital markets and the performance of our fixed income business. In broad terms, these relationships are summarized in Table 1.8. 

Table 1.8 

Key Drivers of 

Fixed Income Performance 

##TABLE_START Driver If Driver Is: FI Revenues Tend to Be: Interest rates Rising Lower Falling Higher Market volatility Low Lower Moderate Higher Yield curve Flatter Lower Steeper Higher Credit spreads Narrower Lower Wider Higher Economy outlook Positive Lower Negative Higher ##TABLE_END

In many circumstances these drivers deliver mixed impacts on fixed income performance, with some pushing higher while others push lower, or with some drivers pushing weakly while others are stronger. If most or all drivers strongly push in the same direction at the same time, fixed income performance usually is strongly impacted. Revenue levels in a strongly &#8220;higher&#8221; year can be more than double what they are in a strongly &#8220;lower&#8221; year. As a result, fixed income performance can be highly variable from year to year. 

Mortgage Origination and Related Services 

The strength of consumer mortgage lending activity in the U.S. impacts three businesses of ours: mortgage origination and related services, title services, and commercial lending to other mortgage lenders. 

Mortgage lending activity is strongly linked to interest rate cycles. Activity tends to be inversely related to prevailing mortgage rates: when rates are high, home-buying and refinancing decrease, and when rates are low, home-buying and refinancing increase. Moreover, expectations about near-term future mortgage rates can accelerate or delay those impacts, as borrowers rush to avoid future rate increases or wait for future rate decreases. 

Human Resources Management 

Firstpower Culture 

Our principal business is providing financial services to our clients. Although many financial services can be delivered through technology today, we believe that our clients&#8217; experiences with our associates is a critical way we differentiate from our competitors. Specifically, we ask our associates to take advantage of every opportunity to anticipate client needs and exceed client expectations. 

For this &#8220;differentiated experience&#8221; strategy to succeed, we must build and nurture a diverse and inclusive workplace culture that strives to attract, hire, and retain the best people available by compensating 

##TABLE_START

and, just as importantly, treating people fairly; ensure that associates have opportunities for professional growth and advancement within the company; support associates with appropriate workplace resources and training; promote constructive collegiality and a sense of workplace community; encourage innovation and the development of better ways to address business challenges; publicly recognize within the company associate achievements, both great and small; and promote behaviors that provide clients with best-in-class service. At First Horizon, we call that culture &#8220;Firstpower.&#8221; 

We have evolved Firstpower as a part of our MOE to incorporate aspects of both organizations&#8212;expanded expertise, resources and geographic footprint&#8212;into the culture of our company. We have developed the following Purpose, Promise and Principles to guide our associates on our core values and philosophies.

##TABLE_START Supervision and Regulation ##TABLE_END

Scope of this Section 

This section describes certain of the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to bank and financial holding companies and their subsidiaries, and to companies engaged in securities and insurance activities. It also provides certain specific information about us. To the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by express reference to each of the particular statutory and regulatory provisions. A change in applicable statutes, regulations, or regulatory policy may have a material effect on our business. 

Overview 

The Corporation 

First Horizon Corporation is a bank holding company and financial holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the &#8220;BHCA&#8221;), and is registered with the Federal Reserve. We are subject to the regulation and supervision of, and to examination by, the Federal Reserve under the BHCA. We are required to file with the Federal Reserve annual reports and such additional information as the Federal Reserve may require pursuant to the BHCA. 

A bank holding company that is not a financial holding company is limited to engaging in &#8220;banking&#8221; and activities found by the Federal Reserve to be &#8220;closely related to banking.&#8221; Eligible bank holding companies that elect to become financial holding companies may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in activities that are &#8220;financial in nature.&#8221; &#8220;Financial&#8221; activities are broader in scope than those which are &#8220;closely related to banking.&#8221; See Financial Activities other than Banking beginning on page 23 below. 

The Federal Reserve may approve an application by a bank holding company to acquire a bank located outside the acquirer&#8217;s principal state of operations without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited under state law, although state law may still impose certain requirements. See Interstate Branching and Mergers beginning on page 23, and Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;) beginning on page 23. 

The Tennessee Bank Structure Act of 1974, among other things, prohibits (subject to certain exceptions) a bank holding company from acquiring a bank for which the home state is Tennessee (a &#8220;Tennessee bank&#8221;) if, upon consummation, the company would directly or indirectly control 30% or more of the total deposits in insured depository institutions in 

Tennessee. As of June 30, 2020, the FDIC reports that the Bank held approximately 16% of such deposits. 

The Bank 

First Horizon Bank, our most significant subsidiary, is a Tennessee banking corporation subject to the regulation and supervision of, and to examination by, the TDFI. In addition to general supervision and examination powers, the TDFI has the power to approve mergers with the Bank, the Bank&#8217;s issuance of preferred stock or capital notes, the establishment of banking centers, and many other corporate actions. 

The Bank has chosen to be a member of the Federal Reserve; as a result, the Federal Reserve is the Bank&#8217;s primary federal regulator. As a member bank, the Bank must buy and hold stock in its district Federal Reserve Bank equal to 6% of the Bank&#8217;s capital stock and surplus. The Bank is paid a dividend on its investment at a rate which varies with ten-year U.S. Treasury rates, capped at 6%. The Bank cannot sell its investment in Federal Reserve Bank stock, and the investment provides the Bank with no control over the Federal Reserve System. 

Tennessee law requires the Bank, as a member of the Federal Reserve, to comply with federal capital and many other regulatory requirements in lieu of, or sometimes in addition to, state requirements. For that reason, this &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; section focuses on federal requirements for many topics related to the Bank, mentioning state requirements only where significant. 

From 1864 until October 2019, the Bank was a national banking association subject to the regulation and supervision of, and to examination by, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. During October 2019, the Bank converted from a national bank to a Tennessee state bank. Conversion did not significantly alter the scope of the Bank&#8217;s activities: Tennessee law generally allows a Tennessee state bank to take any action that a Tennessee-based national bank could take. 

The Bank is insured by, and subject to regulation by, the FDIC and is subject to regulation in certain respects by the CFPB. The Bank is also subject to various requirements and restrictions under federal and state law, including requirements to maintain reserves against deposits, restrictions on the types and amounts of loans that may be made and the interest that may be charged, limitations on the types of investments that may be made, activities that may 

##TABLE_START 

FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION 

&#160; 18 

2020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT ##TABLE_END

be engaged in, and types of services that may be offered. Various consumer laws and regulations also affect the operations of the Bank. In addition, several of the Bank&#8217;s subsidiaries are regulated separately, as discussed in Subsidiaries beginning on page 15 of this report. 

In addition to the impact of regulation, commercial banks are affected significantly by the actions of the Federal Reserve as it attempts to control money supply and credit availability in order to influence the economy. Also, the Bank and certain of its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with extensions of credit, leases or sales of property, or furnishing products or services. 

The regulatory framework governing banks and the financial industry is intended primarily to protect depositors and the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund, not to protect our Bank or our security holders. 

Regulatory Tiers Based on Asset Size 

Many rules dealing with critical regulatory topics divide banks into tiers based largely or entirely on asset size. Different topics have different cut-off points for the tiers. Within each topic, different rules apply to the different tiers. 

Cut-off points vary significantly. However, as a rough generalization, for many regulatory topics the critical cut-off points are $10 billion, $100 billion, and $250 billion. Companies with less than $10 billion are less regulated in several important ways than we are, and companies with $250 billion or more are regulated much more severely in many important ways than we are. As a result, under current law, compliance costs and restrictions grow with size, they tend to change abruptly as a company crosses to the next tier, and we are in a middle tier in many respects. 

The remainder of this Supervision and Regulation discussion focuses on current rules which apply to FHN based on our current asset size. 

Large-Bank Supervision Risk Categories 

Federal regulators have established four risk-based categories for applying enhanced prudential standards (enhanced for larger banks). Category I applies to the global systemically important companies. Categories II, III, and IV apply (with certain exceptions) to institutions with total consolidated assets of at least $700 billion, $250 billion, and $100 billion, respectively. Currently, we and the Bank are below Category IV&#8217;s floor and therefore, generally, we are not subject to enhanced prudential standards. 

Payment of Dividends 

First Horizon Corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from First Horizon Bank and other subsidiaries. Our principal source of cash flow, 

including cash flow to pay dividends on our stock or to pay principal (including premium, if any) and interest on debt securities, is dividends from the Bank. There are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by the Bank to us, as well as by us to ours shareholders. 

The Corporation 

Under Tennessee corporate law, we are not permitted to pay cash dividends if, after giving effect to such payment, we would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business or our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus any amounts needed to satisfy any preferential rights if we were dissolving. In addition, in deciding whether or not to declare a dividend of any particular size, our Board must consider our current and prospective capital, liquidity, and other needs, including the needs of the Bank which we are obligated to support. 

The Bank 

Under Tennessee corporate law, the Bank (like the Corporation, discussed above) may not pay a dividend if the Bank would not be able to pay its debts when due or if the Bank&#8217;s assets would be inadequate, in a dissolution, to pay liabilities and preferential rights. Similarly, the Bank&#8217;s Board must consider current and prospective needs in making a decision to declare a dividend. 

In addition, in order to pay cash dividends, the Bank must obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve and the TDFI Commissioner if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank&#8217;s board of directors in any calendar year exceeds the total of (i) the Bank&#8217;s retained net income for that year plus (ii) the Bank&#8217;s retained net income for the preceding two years, less certain required capital transfers, as applicable. Below that ceiling, approval generally is not required (but see Other Factors Affecting Dividends immediately following this discussion). Applying the applicable rules, at January 1, 2021, the Bank could legally declare cash dividends on the Bank's common or preferred stock totaling approximately $897 million without obtaining approval. The application of those restrictions to the Bank is discussed in more detail in the following sections, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1 by reference: under the caption Liquidity Risk Management in our 2020 MD&#38;A (Item 7) beginning on page 92 of this report; and under the caption Restrictions on dividends in Note 13&#8212;Regulatory Capital and Restrictions of our 2020 Financial Statements (Item 8), beginning on page 175. 

Other Factors Affecting Dividends 

If, in the opinion of the Federal Reserve, we or the Bank are engaged in or about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice (which, depending on the 

##TABLE_START 

FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION 

&#160; 19 

2020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT ##TABLE_END

financial condition of FHN or the Bank, could include the payment of dividends), the Federal Reserve may require us or the Bank to cease and desist from that practice. The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution&#8217;s or holding company&#8217;s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. 

In addition, under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, an FDIC-insured depository institution (such as the Bank) may not make any capital distributions, pay any management fees to its holding company, or pay any dividend if it is undercapitalized or if such payment would cause it to become undercapitalized. 

The payment of cash dividends by us or by the Bank also may be affected or limited by other factors, such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines and requirements imposed by debt covenants. For example, as discussed under Capital Adequacy starting on page 20, our ability to pay dividends would be restricted if its capital ratios fell below minimum regulatory requirements plus a capital conservation buffer. 

The Federal Reserve generally requires insured banks and bank holding companies to pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. The Federal Reserve has released a supervisory letter advising, among other things, that a bank holding company should inform the Federal Reserve and should eliminate, defer, or significantly reduce its dividends if (i) the bank holding company&#8217;s net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (ii) the bank holding company&#8217;s prospective rate of earnings is not consistent with the bank holding company&#8217;s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or (iii) the bank holding company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. 

Transactions with Affiliates 

The Bank&#8217;s ability to lend or extend credit to its parent company or nonbank subsidiaries (including for purposes of this paragraph, in certain situations, subsidiaries of the Bank) is restricted. The Bank and its subsidiaries generally may not extend credit to us or to any other affiliate in an amount which exceeds 10% of the Bank&#8217;s capital stock and surplus and may not extend credit in the aggregate to all such affiliates in an amount which exceeds 20% of its capital stock and surplus. Extensions of credit and other transactions between the Bank and us or such other affiliates must be on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that are substantially the same or at least as favorable to the Bank as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated companies. Further, the type, 

amount, and quality of collateral which must secure such extensions of credit is regulated. 

There are similar legal restrictions on: the Bank&#8217;s purchases of or investments in the securities of and purchases of assets from us and our nonbank subsidiaries; the Bank&#8217;s loans or extensions of credit to third parties collateralized by the securities or obligations of ours and our nonbank subsidiaries; the issuance of guaranties, acceptances, and letters of credit on behalf of us and our nonbank subsidiaries; and certain bank transactions with us and our nonbank subsidiaries, or with respect to which we and our nonbank subsidiaries act as agent, participate, or have a financial interest. 

Capital Adequacy 

Federal financial industry regulators require that regulated institutions maintain minimum capital levels. The capital rules in the U.S. are based on international standards known as &#8220;Basel III.&#8221; Those U.S. rules require the following: 

&#8226; Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio. For all supervised financial institutions, including us and the Bank, the ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital to risk-weighted assets (&#8220;Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio&#8221;) must be at least 4.5%. To be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio must be at least 6.5%. Common Equity Tier 1 Capital consists of core components of Tier 1 Capital. The core components consist of common stock plus retained earnings net of goodwill, other intangible assets, and certain other required deduction items. At December 31, 2020, our Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 9.68% and the Bank&#8217;s was 10.46%. 

&#8226; Tier 1 Capital Ratio. For all supervised financial institutions, including us and the Bank, the ratio of Tier 1 Capital to risk-weighted assets must be at least 6%. To be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; the Tier 1 Capital ratio must be at least 8%. Tier 1 Capital consists of the Tier 1 core components discussed in the bulleted paragraph immediately above, plus non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, a limited amount of minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, and a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock, net of goodwill, other intangible assets, and certain other required deduction items. At December 31, 2020, our Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 10.74% and the Bank&#8217;s was 10.93%. 

&#8226; Total Capital Ratio. For all supervised financial institutions, including us and the Bank, the ratio of Total Capital to risk-weighted assets must be at least 8%. To be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; the Total Capital ratios must be at least 10%. At December 31, 2020, our Total Capital Ratio was 12.57% and the Bank&#8217;s was 12.52%. 

##TABLE_START 

FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION 

&#160; 20 

2020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT ##TABLE_END

&#8226; Capital Conservation Buffer. If a capital conservation buffer of an additional 2.5% above the minimum required Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio, Tier 1 Capital ratio, and Total Capital ratio is not maintained, special restrictions would apply to capital distributions, such as dividends and stock repurchases, and on certain compensatory bonuses. 

&#8226; Leverage Ratio&#8212;Base. For all supervised financial institutions, including us or the Bank, the Leverage ratio must be at least 4%. To be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; the Leverage ratio must be at least 5%. The Leverage ratio is Tier 1 Capital divided by quarterly average assets net of goodwill, certain other intangible assets, and certain required deduction items. At December 31, 2020, our Leverage ratio was 8.24% and the Bank&#8217;s was 8.36%. 

&#8226; Leverage Ratio&#8212;Supplemental. For the largest internationally active supervised financial institutions, not including us or the Bank, a minimum supplementary Leverage ratio must be maintained that takes into account certain off-balance sheet exposures. 

We believe that we and the Bank were in compliance with applicable minimum capital requirements as of December 31, 2020. 

Federal regulators have incorporated market and interest-rate risk components into its risk-based capital standards. Those standards explicitly identify concentration of credit risk and certain risks arising from non-traditional activities, and the management of such risks, as important qualitative factors to consider in assessing an institution&#8217;s overall capital adequacy. 

Federal regulators&#8217; market risk rules are applicable to covered institutions&#8212;those with aggregate trading assets and trading liabilities of at least 10% of their total assets or at least $1 billion. We and the Bank are covered institutions under the rule. The rules specify the methodology for calculating the amount of 

risk-weighted assets related to trading assets and include, among other things, the addition of a component for stressed value at risk. The rule eliminates the use of credit ratings in calculating specific risk capital requirements for certain debt and securitization positions. Alternative standards of creditworthiness are used for specific standardized risks, such as exposures to sovereign debt, public sector entities, other banking institutions, corporate debt, and securitizations. In addition, an 8% capital surcharge applies to certain covered institutions, not including us or the Bank. 

Moreover, the Federal Reserve has indicated that it considers a &#8220;Tangible Tier 1 Capital Leverage Ratio&#8221; (deducting all intangibles) and other indicia of capital strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities. 

Failure to meet capital guidelines could subject a bank to a variety of enforcement remedies, including the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, and to certain restrictions on its business and in certain circumstances to the appointment of a conservator or receiver. See Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) immediately below for additional information. 

In addition, the Bank is required to have a capital structure that the TDFI determines is adequate, based on TDFI&#8217;s assessment of the Bank&#8217;s businesses and risks. The TDFI may require the Bank to increase its capital, if found to be inadequate. 

Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) 

Federal banking regulators must take &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; regarding FDIC-insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For this purpose, insured depository institutions are divided into five capital categories. The specific requirements applicable to us are summarized in Table 1.9

At December 31, 2020, the Bank had sufficient capital to qualify as &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; under the regulatory capital requirements discussed above. An institution may be deemed to be in a capitalization category that is lower than is indicated by its actual capital position if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating. Institutions generally are not allowed to publicly disclose examination results. 

An FDIC-insured depository institution generally is prohibited from making any capital distribution (including payment of dividends) or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. Undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the Federal Reserve System. In addition, undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans. An insured depository institution&#8217;s holding company must guarantee the capital plan, up to an amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the depository institution&#8217;s assets at the time it becomes undercapitalized or the amount of the capital deficiency when the institution fails to comply with the plan, for the plan to be accepted by the applicable federal regulatory authority. The federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution&#8217;s capital. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it were significantly undercapitalized. 

Significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. 

Critically undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator, generally within 90 days of the date on which they become critically undercapitalized. 

Liquidity Coverage Ratio 

The LCR requirement does not apply to institutions with assets of less than $100 billion, and so does not apply to us or the Bank. For larger institutions, the requirement applies based on a bank&#8217;s asset size. 

Holding Company Structure and Support of Subsidiary Banks 

Because we are a holding company, our right to participate in the assets of any subsidiary upon the latter&#8217;s liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary&#8217;s creditors (including depositors in the case of the Bank) except to the extent that we may be a creditor with recognized claims against the subsidiary. In addition, depositors of a bank, and the FDIC as their subrogee, would be entitled to priority over the other creditors in the event of liquidation of the bank. 

Under Federal Reserve policy we are expected to act as a source of financial strength to, and to commit resources to support, the Bank. This support may be required at times even if, absent such Federal Reserve policy, we might not wish to provide it. In addition, any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank. In the event of a bank holding company&#8217;s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.

Cross-Guarantee Liability 

A depository institution insured by the FDIC can be held liable for any loss incurred by, or reasonably expected to be incurred by, the FDIC in connection with (i) the default of a commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institution or (ii) any assistance provided by the FDIC to any commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institution &#8220;in danger of default.&#8221; &#8220;Default&#8221; is defined generally as the appointment of a conservator or receiver and &#8220;in danger of default&#8221; is defined generally as the existence of certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance. The FDIC&#8217;s claim for damages is superior to claims of shareholders of the insured depository institution or its holding company but is subordinate to claims of depositors, secured creditors, and holders of subordinated debt (other than affiliates) of the commonly controlled insured depository institution. 

Currently the Bank is our only depository institution subsidiary. If we were to own or operate another depository institution, any loss suffered by the FDIC in respect of one subsidiary bank would likely result in assertion of the cross-guarantee provisions, the assessment of estimated losses against our other subsidiary bank(s), and a potential loss of our investment in our subsidiary banks. 

Interstate Branching and Mergers 

As mentioned above, the Bank generally must have TDFI&#8217;s approval to establish a new banking center (technically, a &#8220;branch&#8221;). For a new banking center located outside of Tennessee, Tennessee law requires the Bank to comply with branching laws applicable to the state where the new banking center will be located. Federal law allows the Bank to establish or acquire a branch in another state to the same extent as a bank chartered in that other state would be allowed to establish or acquire a branch in Tennessee. 

For an interstate merger or acquisition: the acquiring bank must be well-capitalized and well-managed; concentration limits on liabilities and deposits may not be exceeded; regulators must assess the transaction for incremental systemic risk; and the acquiring bank must have at least &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; standing under the federal Community Reinvestment Act (discussed immediately below). 

Once a bank has established branches in a state through de novo or acquired branching or through an interstate merger transaction, the bank may then establish or acquire additional branches within that state to the same extent that a bank chartered in that state is allowed to establish or acquire branches within the state. 

Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;) 

The CRA requires each U.S. bank, consistent with safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of each community where the bank accepts deposits, including low- and moderate-income (&#8220;LMI&#8221;) communities. The Federal Reserve assesses the Bank periodically for CRA compliance, and that assessment is made public. The Bank&#8217;s LMI operations and activities traditionally are critical focal points in those assessments. 

A CRA rating below &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; can slow or halt a bank&#8217;s plans to expand by branching, acquisition, or merger, and can prevent a bank holding company from becoming a financial holding company. The Bank received a rating of &#8220;Satisfactory&#8221; in its most recent CRA assessment, issued in 2017. The next CRA assessment is ongoing at the time this report is filed. 

Late in 2020, the Federal Reserve proposed changes to its regulations under the CRA. Among other things, the proposal would add quantitative measures to CRA assessments, as well as several new categories of tests. Currently the Federal Reserve, the OCC, and the FDIC have CRA modernization proposals outstanding, and all three differ from each other. 

Financial Activities other than Banking 

Federal Law 

Federal law generally allows financial holding companies broad authority to engage in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity. These include: insurance underwriting and brokerage; merchant banking; securities underwriting, dealing, and market-making; real estate development; and such additional activities as the Federal Reserve in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury determines to be financial in nature or incidental. A bank holding company may engage in these activities directly or through subsidiaries by qualifying as a &#8220;financial holding company.&#8221; To qualify as a financial holding company, a bank holding company must file an initial declaration with the Federal Reserve, certifying that all of its subsidiary depository institutions are well-managed and well-capitalized. 

Federal law also permits banks to engage in certain of these activities through financial subsidiaries. To control or hold an interest in a financial subsidiary, a bank must meet the following requirements: 

(1) The bank must receive approval from its primary federal regulator for the financial subsidiary to engage in the activities. 

(2) The bank and its depository institution affiliates must each be well-capitalized and well-managed. 

(3) The aggregate consolidated total assets of all of the bank&#8217;s financial subsidiaries must not exceed the lesser of: 45% of the bank&#8217;s consolidated total 

##TABLE_START 

FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION 

&#160; 23 

2020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT ##TABLE_END

assets; or $50 billion (subject to indexing for inflation). 

(4) The bank must have in place adequate policies and procedures to identify and manage financial and operational risks and to preserve the separate identities and limited liability of the bank and the financial subsidiary. 

(5) If the bank is among the 100 largest banks, the bank must meet the long-term debt rating or alternative standards adopted by the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury from time to time. If this fifth requirement ceases to be met after a bank controls or holds an interest in a financial subsidiary, the bank cannot invest additional capital in that subsidiary until the requirement again is met. 

No new activity may be commenced unless the bank and all of its depository institution affiliates have at least &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; CRA ratings. Certain restrictions apply if the bank holding company or the bank fails to continue to meet one or more of the requirements listed above. 

In addition, federal law contains a number of other provisions that may affect the Bank&#8217;s operations, including limitations on the use and disclosure to third parties of client information. 

At December 31, 2020, we are a financial holding company and the Bank has a number of financial subsidiaries, as discussed in Subsidiaries beginning on page 15 of this report. 

Tennessee Law 

Tennessee law does not expressly restrict the activities of a bank holding company or its non-bank affiliates. However, no Tennessee bank may maintain a branch office on the premises of an affiliate if the affiliate is engaged in activities that are not permissible for a bank holding company, a financial holding company, a national bank, or a national bank subsidiary under federal law. Tennessee law permits Tennessee banks to establish subsidiaries and to engage in any activities permissible for a national bank located in Tennessee, subject to compliance with Tennessee regulations relating to the conduct of such activities for the purpose of maintaining bank safety and soundness. 

Interchange Fee Restrictions 

Regulations severely cap interchange fees which the Bank may charge merchants for debit card transactions. 

Volcker Rule 

The Volcker rule (1) generally prohibits banks from engaging in proprietary trading, which is engaging as principal (for the bank&#8217;s own account) in any purchase or sale of one or more of certain types of 

financial instruments, and (2) limits banks&#8217; ability to invest in or sponsor hedge funds or private equity funds. 

Consumer Regulation by the CFPB 

The CFPB adopts and administers significant rules affecting consumer lending and consumer financial services. Key rules for the Bank include detailed regulation of mortgage servicing practices and detailed regulation of mortgage origination and underwriting practices. The latter rules, among other things, establish the definition of a &#8220;qualified mortgage&#8221; using traditional underwriting practices involving down payments, credit history, income levels and verification, and so forth. The rules do not prohibit, but do tend to discourage, lenders from originating non-qualified mortgages. 

Data Privacy &#38; Security 

Federal law restricts the Bank&#8217;s ability to share certain information with affiliates and non-affiliates for marketing and/or non-marketing purposes, or to contact clients with marketing offers. Federal law also requires banks to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards. 

Data privacy and protection increasingly is a significant legislative, regulatory, and societal concern. The concern is driven by major technological and societal shifts in the past 20 years, led by relatively unregulated firms such as Amazon.com, Alibaba, Facebook, and Google and their many clients worldwide. Those firms have gathered large amounts of personal details about millions of people, and today have the ability to analyze that data and act on that analysis very quickly. These firms seek to understand enough about a person to know what a person wants before the person does. 

Banks (as mentioned above) already are subject to significant privacy regulations. Probably for that reason, the banking industry is not at the political center of these concerns today. Even so, banks are likely to be affected by broader legislative and regulatory responses to the perceived problems. Two prominent responses to date include the European Union General Data Protection Regulation and the California Data Privacy Protection Act. Neither is a banking industry regulation, but both apply to banks in relation to certain clients. To date, neither has had a material impact on the Bank. 

FDIC Insurance Assessments; DIFA 

U.S. bank deposits generally are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;), administered by the FDIC. The system of FDIC insurance premium rates charged consists of a rate grid structure in which base rates range from 5 to 35 basis points annually, and fully adjusted rates range from 2.5 to 45 basis 

##TABLE_START 

FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION 

&#160; 24 

2020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT ##TABLE_END

points annually. (A basis point is equal to 0.01%.) Key factors in the grid include: the institution&#8217;s risk category (I to IV); whether the institution is deemed large and highly complex; whether the institution qualifies for an unsecured debt adjustment; and whether the institution is burdened with a brokered deposit adjustment. Other factors can impact the base against which the applicable rate is applied, including (for example) whether a net loss is realized. 

Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order, or condition imposed by a federal bank regulatory agency. 

Depositor Preference 

Federal law provides that deposits and certain claims for administrative expenses and associate compensation against an insured depository institution would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution, including federal funds and letters of credit, in the &#8220;liquidation or other resolution&#8221; of such an institution by any receiver. 

Securities Regulation 

Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to various securities laws and regulations and capital adequacy requirements promulgated by the regulatory and exchange authorities of the jurisdictions in which they operate. 

Our registered broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the SEC&#8217;s net capital rule, Rule 15c3-1. That rule requires the maintenance of minimum net capital and limits the ability of the broker-dealer to transfer large amounts of capital to a parent company or affiliate. Compliance with the rule could limit operations that require intensive use of capital, such as underwriting and trading. 

Certain of our subsidiaries are registered investment advisers which are regulated under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Advisory contracts with clients automatically terminate under these laws upon an assignment of the contract by the investment adviser unless appropriate consents are obtained. 

Insurance Activities 

Certain of our subsidiaries sell various types of insurance as agent in a number of states. Insurance activities are subject to regulation by the states in which such business is transacted. Although most of such regulation focuses on insurance companies and their insurance products, insurance agents and their activities are also subject to regulation by the states, including, among other things, licensing and marketing and sales practices. 

Compensation and Risk Management 

The Federal Reserve has issued guidance intended to ensure that incentive compensation arrangements at financial organizations take into account risk and are consistent with safe and sound practices. The guidance is based on three &#8220;key principles&#8221; calling for incentive compensation plans to: appropriately balance risks and rewards; be compatible with effective controls and risk management; and be backed up by strong corporate governance. In response: we operate an enhanced risk management process for assessing risk in incentive compensation plans; several key incentive programs use a net profit approach rather than a revenues-only approach; and mandatory deferral features are used in several key programs, including an executive program. 

In 2016 federal agencies proposed regulations which could significantly change the regulation of incentive compensation programs at financial institutions. The proposal would create four tiers of institutions based on asset size. Institutions in the top two tiers would be subject to rules much more detailed and proscriptive than are currently in effect. If interpreted aggressively by the regulators, the proposed rules could be used to prevent, as a practical matter, larger institutions from engaging in certain lines of business where substantial commission and bonus pool arrangements are the norm. In the 2016 proposal, the top two tiers included institutions with more than $50 billion of assets. We and the Bank currently would fall into the lower of those top two tiers. However, prompted by post-2016 legislation which significantly raised several statutory asset-size tiers, if this proposal were finalized today, the $50 billion floor might be raised significantly, allowing us to remain in the third tier. We cannot predict what final rules may be adopted, nor how they may be implemented. 

##TABLE_START Effect of Governmental Policies ##TABLE_END

The Bank is affected by the policies of regulatory authorities, including the Federal Reserve, the TDFI, and the CFPB. The Federal Reserve also sets and manages monetary policy for the U.S. In this latter role, the Federal Reserve&#8217;s mandate from Congress is to pursue price stability and full employment. 

Among the instruments of monetary policy used by the Federal Reserve are: purchases and sales of U.S. government and other securities in the marketplace; changes in the discount rate, which is the rate any depository institution must pay to borrow from the Federal Reserve; changes in the reserve requirements of depository institutions; changes in the rate paid on banks&#8217; required and excess reserve 

##TABLE_START 

FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION 

&#160; 25 

2020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT ##TABLE_END

deposits at the Federal Reserve; and changes in the federal funds rate, which is the rate at which depository institutions lend balances to each other overnight. These instruments are intended to influence economic and monetary growth, interest rate levels, and inflation. 

The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve and other governmental policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the 

future. Because of changing conditions in the national and international economies and in the money markets, as well as the result of actions by monetary and fiscal authorities, it is not possible to predict with certainty future changes in interest rates, deposit levels, loan demand, or the business and results of our operations, or whether changing economic conditions will have a positive or negative effect on operations and earnings. 

##TABLE_START Other Proposals ##TABLE_END

Bills occasionally are introduced in the United States Congress, the Tennessee General Assembly and other state legislatures, and regulations occasionally are proposed by our regulatory agencies, any of which could affect our businesses, financial results, and financial condition. 

We are not able to predict what, if any, changes that Congress, state legislatures, or the regulatory agencies will enact or implement in the future, nor the impact that those actions will have upon us.
