This MD&#38;A should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1, as well as other information contained in this document and FHN's 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Recent Events 

Merger of Equals 

On July 1, 2020, FHN completed its merger of equals with IBERIABANK Corporation . Reported results for FHN reflect legacy FHN prior to the completion of the merger and results from both FHN and IBKC from the merger closing date forward. As such, comparative income statement data in this MD&#38;A for the first quarter of 2020 is only for legacy FHN. 

COVID-19 Pandemic 

Government and societal reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic caused extraordinary disruption to the U.S. economy, as well as to the local economies within 

FHN's footprint, during the final three quarters of 2020 and continuing into the first quarter of 2021. Business activity, especially lending, declined throughout 2020 and into first quarter this year. In certain business lines, FHN reduced or stopped new lending because of the pandemic. 

In the fourth quarter of 2020, two extremely effective vaccines were approved in the U.S. Administration of those vaccines began late in 2020, nationwide but on a narrowly targeted basis. In the first quarter of 2021, vaccine production and distribution increased, and a third vaccine was approved in the U.S. Public vaccination in the U.S. has accelerated during the first four months of 2021. In many of FHN's markets, COVID-19 restrictions at least partially were eased by the end of March or during April, and FHN believes further easing is likely in the rest of 2021. COVID-19 restrictions still had a substantial impact on FHN and its clients in the first quarter of 2021, but FHN expects those impacts to diminish over the rest of this year as the vaccinated percentage of the U.S. population continues to climb. Within the U.S. economy, broadly speaking, manufacturing has largely recovered while services continue to lag significantly, especially in hospitality and leisure. 

Risk of resurgence remains as new virus variants continue to be identified around the world. As a result, FHN continues to closely monitor the pandemic and its effects on clients, especially credit quality, on FHN's communities, and on the financial markets. FHN continues to reach out to clients to discuss challenges and solutions, to provide line draws and new extensions to existing clients, to provide support for small businesses through the Paycheck Protection Program and other stimulus programs, and to provide lending and deposit assistance through deferrals and waived fees. 

The pandemic has resulted in modest operational disruptions for FHN . Clients' physical access to banking centers has been restricted off and on in many markets and many non-client-facing associates have worked largely on a remote basis. FHN has also implemented additional sick time and child care assistance for associates.

Financial Summary 

Quarterly Financial Performance Summary 

First Quarter 2021 versus Fourth Quarter 2020 

First quarter 2021 net income available to common shareholders was $225 million , or $0.40 per diluted share, compared to $234 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, in fourth quarter 2020. First quarter 2021 results produced a return on average assets of 1.12% and a return on average common equity of 12.01% compared to 1.16% and 12.53% for fourth quarter 2020. 

Net interest income of $508 million declined $14 million from fourth quarter 2020, driven by the impact of a decrease in average loans, day count and lower short-term rates partially offset by improved funding costs. 

The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $45 million for the first quarter of 2021, compared to expense of $1 million for fourth quarter 2020, largely reflecting continued improvement in the overall macroeconomic outlook and a reduction in consumer loans . 

Noninterest income of $298 million increased $10 million from fourth quarter 2020 , primarily reflecting strong fixed income offset by decreases in mortgage banking and title income, deposit transaction and cash management fees, deferred compensation and derivative sales. 

Noninterest expense of $544 million increased $36 million from fourth quarter 2020, largely as a result of IBKC merger integration expenses. 

First Quarter 2021 versus First Quarter 2020 

First quarter 2021 net income available to common shareholders was $225 million , or $0.40 per diluted share, compared to $12 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, in first quarter 2020 driven by the impact of the July 1, 2020 IBKC merger and a lower provision for credit losses. First quarter 2021 results produced a return on average assets of 1.12% and a return on average common equity of 12.01% compared to 0.15% and 1.05% for the first quarter 2020. 

Net interest income increased 68% to $508 million compared to first quarter 2020, driven by an increase in average interest-earning assets as a result of the 

IBKC merger and Truist branch acquisition. Results also reflect the benefit of deposit pricing discipline and PPP lending, which helped to partially offset the impact of lower interest rates. 

The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $45 million for the first quarter of 2021, compared to expense of $154 million for first quarter 2020 . The decrease in provision was primarily attributable to improvement in the overall macro-economic outlook. 

Noninterest income of $298 million increased $124 million from first quarter 2020 , primarily driven by the impact of the IBKC merger. Results also reflect an increase in fixed income revenue during the quarter. 

Noninterest expense of $544 million increased $242 million from first quarter 2020, largely as a result of the IBKC merger. Noninterest expense for the first quarter of 2021 included $70 million in merger and acquisition-related costs compared to $6 million in first quarter 2020. 

Financial Condition Summary 

Total assets at March 31, 2021 of $87.5 billion increased $3.3 billion, or 4%, from $84.2 billion at December 31, 2020. 

Period-end loans and leases of $58.6 billion increased $368 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2020 driven by a $1.0 billion increase in commercial loans primarily tied to PPP loans, offset by a $674 million decrease in consumer loans. Average loans and leases of $58.2 billion in first quarter 2021 increased $27.7 billion from $30.5 billion in first quarter 2020 primarily driven by the IBKC merger. 

Period-end deposits of $73.2 billion increased $3.2 billion, or 5%, from December 31, 2020, largely reflecting growth in noninterest-bearing deposits from the impact of stimulus checks and PPP loan funding. Average deposits of $71.0 billion for first quarter 2021 increased from $32.9 billion for first quarter 2020 . 

FHN maintained strong capital measures. The Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital ratios at March 31, 2021 we re 11.05% and 12.84%, respectively, compared to 10.74% and 12.57% at December 31, 2020, respectively. The CET1 ratio was 9.97% at March 31, 2021 compared to 9.68% at December 31, 2020 .

Results of Operations 

Net Interest Income/Net Interest Margin 

Net interest income is FHN's largest source of revenue and is the difference between the interest earned on interest-earning assets (generally loans, leases and investment securities) and the interest expense incurred in connection with interest-bearing liabilities (generally deposits and borrowed funds). The level of net interest income is primarily a function of the difference between the effective yield on average interest-earning assets and the effective cost of interest-bearing liabilities. These factors are influenced by the pricing and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by external factors such as local economic conditions, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the FRB and market interest rates. 

First Quarter 2021 versus Fourth Quarter 2020 

Net interest income for first quarter 2021 decreased $14 million from fourth quarter 2020. This decrease 

reflected a $23 million decrease in interest income, the result of lower average loan balances, a decrease in day count, and lower short-term rates. Partially offsetting the decrease in interest income was a $9 million decrease in interest expense, driven by deposit pricing discipline, as the rate on deposits decreased 6 basis points from fourth quarter 2020, as well as a $243 million decrease in average long-term borrowings. 

The net interest margin was 2.63% in first quarter 2021, down 8 basis points from fourth quarter 2020, while the net interest spread of 2.52% in first quarter 2021 was down 7 basis points. The decline in net interest margin for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 was primarily the result of a 13 basis point decrease in earning asset yields, largely driven by an unfavorable mix shift to lower yielding assets. 

Average earning assets increased $1.7 billion to $78.7 billion for first quarter 2021 from $77.0 billion for fourth quarter of 2020, primarily driven by a $3.1 billion increase in average interest-bearing cash, 

FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION 71 

1Q21 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

partially offset by a $1.6 billion decrease in average loans and leases from a reduction in new originations, continued payoffs, and a decrease in loans to mortgage companies, partially offset by growth in asset-based lending and commercial real estate. The mix shift also contributed to a decline in earning asset yield from the prior quarter. 

First Quarter 2021 versus First Quarter 2020 

Net interes t income increased $205 million in first quarter 2021 from $303 million in first quarter 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in average earning assets from the IBKC merger and Truist branch acquisition in third quarter 2020, deposit pricing discipline, and PPP lending, partially offset by the negative impact of lower interest yields on loans from the decline of LIBOR and Prime rates . 

The net interest margin in first quarter 2021 was down 53 basis points from 3.16% in first quarter 2020. The net interest spread of 2.52% in first quarter 2021 was down 37 basis points from the first quarter 2020 . The decline in net interest margin for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 was primarily the result of a 108 basis point decrease in earning asset yields, as the negative impact of lower short-term interest rates was partially offset by the benefit of purchase accounting accretion and PPP lending. An increase in average excess cash also negatively impacted net interest margin relative to the prior year. Driven by disciplined deposit pricing, the cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased 71 basis points from first quarter 2020 . 

Average e arning assets increased to $78.7 billion for first quarter 2021 from $38.8 billion for the same quarter of 2020, a $39.9 billion increase primarily driven by the IBKC merger and Truist branch acquisition.

Provision for Credit Losses 

The provision for credit losses includes the provision for loan and lease losses and the provision for unfunded lending commitments. The provision for credit losses is the expense necessary to maintain the ALLL and the accrual for unfunded lending commitments at levels appropriate to absorb management&#8217;s estimate of credit losses expected over the life of the loan and lease portfolio and the portfolio of unfunded loan commitments. 

The provision for credit losses benefit of $45 million compared to expense of $1 million in fourth quarter 

2020, largely reflecting continued improvement in the overall macroeconomic outlook and a reduction in consumer loans. The provision for credit losses decreased $199 million from first quarter 2020 primarily from an improvement in the overall macroeconomic outlook.

First Quarter 2021 versus Fourth Quarter 2020 

Compared to fourth quarter 2020, noninterest income increased $10 million, or 3%, primarily reflecting strong fixed income. Fixed income increased $22 million, or 21%, driven by continued elevated liquidity and weak loan demand among fixed income customers, as well as interest rate volatility.This increase was partially offset by decreases in mortgage banking and title income, deposit transaction and cash management fees, deferred compensation and derivative sales. 

First Quarter 2021 versus First Quarter 2020 

Noninterest income of $298 million for first quarter 2021, increased $124 million , or 71%, compared to 

first quarter 2020, p rimarily driven by the impact of the IBKC merger as well as strong fixed income revenue during the quarter. Fixed income increased $30 million, or 31%, fr om first quarter 2020. Fixed income product revenue of $115 million increased 47%, largely driven by favorable market conditions including market volatility and increased depository liquidity. Revenue from other products of $11 million decreased 39%, primarily driven by lower fees from derivative and loan sales.

First Quarter 2021 versus Fourth Quarter 2020 

Compared to fourth quarter 2020, noninterest expense increased $36 million, or 7%, driven by a $36 million increase in merger and acquisition related expense largely tied to IBKC merger integration costs. First quarter 2021 also included $10 million in derivative valuation adjustments related to prior Visa Class-B share sales. 

First Quarter 2021 versus First Quarter 2020 

Total noninterest expense of $544 million increased $242 million , or 80%, from first quarter 2020 primarily attributable to the impact of the IBKC merger and Truist branch acquisition. In addition to the impact of 

the merger and branch acquisition, the increase in personnel expense reflects an increase in revenue-based compensation due to increases in fixed income and mortgage banking and an increase in deferred compensation expense driven by equity market valuations. Other expense in first quarter 2021 included $33 million in asset impairments related to IBKC merger integration efforts. Total merger and acquisition expense was $70 million in first quarter 2021 compared to $6 million in first quarter 2020. 

Income Taxes 

FHN recorded income tax expense of $71 million in first quarter 2021, compared to $56 million in fourth quarter 2020 and $5 million in first quarter 2020. The effective tax rate was approximate ly 23.2%, 18.7%, 

FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION 75 

1Q21 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

and 22.4% fo r the three months ended March 31, 2020, December 31, 2020 and March 31, 2020, respectively. 

FHN&#8217;s effec tive tax rate is favorably affected by recurring items such as bank-owned life insurance, tax-exempt income, and tax credits and other tax benefits from tax credit investments. The effective rate is unfavorably affected by the non-deductibility of a portion of FHN's FDIC premium, executive compensation and merger expenses. FHN&#8217;s effective tax rate also may be affected by items that may occur in any given period but are not consistent from period to period, such as changes in unrecognized tax benefits. The rate also may be affected by items resulting from business combinations. 

A deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability is recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and 

liabilities. The tax consequence is calculated by applying enacted statutory tax rates, applicable to future years, to these temporary differences. As of March 31, 2021, FHN&#8217;s gross DTA and gross DTL were $472 million and $448 million , respectively, resulting in a net DTA of $24 million at March 31, 2021, compared with a net DTA of less than $1 million at December 31, 2020. 

As of March 31, 2021, FHN had deferred tax asset balances related to federal and state income tax carryforwards of $39 million and $9 million, respectively, which will expire at various da tes. 

FHN believes that it will be able to realize the value of its DTA and that no valuation allowance is needed. FHN monitors its DTA and the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. 

Business Segment Results 

During fourth quarter 2020 , FHN reorganized its internal management structure and, accordingly, its segment reporting structure. Historically, FHN's primary business segments were Regional Banking, Fixed Income, Corporate, and Non-strategic. On July 1, 2020, FHN and IBKC closed their merger of equals transaction. This transaction prompted organizational changes to better integrate and execute the combined Company's strategic priorities across all lines of businesses. As a result, FHN revised its reportable segments to include Regional Banking, Specialty Banking and Corporate. Segment results for the first quarter of 2020 have been recast to adjust for the realignment of the segment reporting structure. See Note 13 - Business Segment Information for additional disclosures related to FHN's operating segments. 

Regional Banking 

The Regional Banking segment generated pre-tax income of $286 million for first quarter 2021 compared to $231 million for fourth quarter 2020 and pre-tax loss of $4 million for first quarter 2020. The increase in first quarter 2021 compared to fourth quarter 2020 was primarily driven by a decrease in noninterest expense and lower provision for credit losses reflecting continued improvement in the overall macroeconomic outlook and a reduction in consumer loans. The increase for the first quarter 2021 compared to first quarter 2020 reflected an increase in revenue offset by an increase in noninterest expense resulting from the IBKC merger and a 

decrease in the provision for credit losses resulting from improvement in the macroeconomic outlook. 

Specialty Banking 

The Specialty Banking segment generated pre-tax income of $197 million for first quarter 2021 compared to $194 million for fourth quarter 2020 and $48 million for first quarter 2020. First quarter 2021 results compared to fourth quarter 2020 included an increase in noninterest income and lower provision for credit losses partially offset by lower net interest income and higher noninterest expense. The increase for the first quarter 2021 compared to first quarter 2020 was driven by an increase in revenue offset by an increase in noninterest expense resulting from the IBKC merger and a decrease in the provision for credit losses resulting from improvement in the macroeconomic outlook. 

Corporate 

The Corporate segment generated pre-tax loss of $176 million for first quarter 2021 compared to $124 million for fourth quarter 2020 and $23 million for first quarter 2020. The increase in pre-tax loss for first quarter 2021 compared to first quarter 2020 reflected an increase in noninterest expense primarily from a $64 million increase in merger and integration-related costs and the impact of the IBKC merger and a decrease in net interest income resulting from the impact of funds transfer pricing, partially offset by an increase in noninterest income primarily resulting from an increase in deferred compensation income

driven by equity market valuations relative to the prior year. 

Financial Condition 

Total period-end assets were $87.5 billion at March 31, 2021 compared to $84.2 billion at December 31, 2020. Asset growth during first quarter 2021 was driven by an increase in cash from deposit growth and by loan growth, primarily C&#38;I loans from PPP loan originations. 

Earning assets consist of loans and leases, loans held for sale, investment securities, and other earning assets, such as trading securities and interest-bearing deposits with banks. A detailed discussion of the major components of earning assets is provided in the following sections. 

Loans and Leases 

Period-end loans and leases increased $368 million, or 1% to $58.6 billion as of March 31, 2021 from $58.2 billion on December 31, 2020, driven by a $1.0 billion increase in commercial loans primarily tied to PPP loans, offset by a $674 million decrease in consumer loans. A verage loans and leas es decreased to $58.2 billion in first quarter 2021 compared to $59.8 billion in fourth quarter 2020 and increased from $30.5 billion in first quarter 2020 primarily from acquired loans during third quarter 2020.

C&#38;I loans are the largest component of the loan portfolio, compr ising 58% of total loans at the end of the first quarter 2021 and 57% at year-end 2020 . C&#38;I loa ns increased 3% from December 31, 2020, largely dri ven by PPP lending and higher balances within Specialty Banking, primarily from mortgage warehouse lending and growth in both the accommodation and food services and healthcare industries. Commercial real estate loans increased 2% to $12.5 billion in first qua rter 2021 driven by growth in Regional Banking and Corporate CRE loans. 

Total co nsumer loans decreased 5% from 2020 to $12.2 billion as of March 31, 2021, largely driven by paydowns in real estate installment loans and home 

equity lines of credit within the Regional Banking segment. 

Loans Held for Sale 

In 2020, FHN obtained IBKC's mortgage banking operations, which includes origination and servicing of residential first lien mortgage loans, primarily fixed rate single-family residential mortgage loans originated by IBKC and committed to be sold in the secondary market. The legacy FHN loans HFS portfolio consists of small business, other consumer loans, the mortgage warehouse, USDA, student, and home equity loans. 

On March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 , loans HFS wer e $811 million and $1.0 billion, re spectively. The decrease in loans HFS was primarily driven by a 

FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION 77 

1Q21 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

seasonal slowdown in mortgage volume, as well as a reduction in refinance activity impacted by a recent rise in mortgage interest rates. Held-for-sale consumer mortgage loans secured by residential real estate in process of foreclosure totaled $2 million at both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

ASSET QUALITY 

Loan and Lease Portfolio Composition 

FHN groups its loans into portfolio segments based on internal classifications reflecting the manner in which the ALLL is established and how credit risk is measured, monitored, and reported. From time to time, and if conditions are such that certain subsegments are uniquely affected by economic or market conditions or are experiencing greater deterioration than other components of the loan portfolio, management may determine the ALLL at a more granular level. Commercial loans and leases are composed of C&#38;I loans and leases and CRE loans. Consumer loans are composed of consumer real estate loans and credit card and other loans. FHN has a concentration of residential real estate loans (19% of total loans). I ndustry concentrations are discussed under the heading C&#38;I below. 

Cr edit underwriting guidelines are outlined in Item 7 of FHN&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 in the Loan Portfolio Composition discussion in the Asset Quality Section . 

F HN&#8217;s credit underwriting guidelines and loan product offerings as of March 31, 2021 are generally consistent with those reported and disclosed in FHN&#8217;s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. 

Commercial Loan and Lease Portfolios 

C&#38;I 

The C&#38;I portfolio totaled $34.0 bill ion as of March 31, 2021 and $33.1 billion as of December 31, 2020 and is comprised of loans and leases used for general business purposes. Products offered in the C&#38;I portfolio include term loan financing of owner-occupied real estate and fixed assets, direct financing and sales-type leases, working capital lines of credit, and trade credit enhancement through letters of cr edit. The largest geographical concentrations of balances in the C&#38;I portfolio as of March 31, 2021 were in Tennessee (21%), Florida (12%), Texas (9%), Louisiana (8%), North Carolina (8%), California (7%), and Georgia (5%). No other state represented more than 5% of the portfolio. 

The following table provides the comp osition of the C&#38;I portfolio by industry as of March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020. For purposes of this disclosure, industries are determined based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) industry codes used by Federal statistical agencies in classifying business establishments for the collection, analysis, and publication of statistical data related to the U.S. business economy.

Industry Concentrations 

Loan concentrations exist when there are loans to numerous borrowers engaged in similar activities that would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditi ons. Loans to mortgage companies and borrowers in the finance and insurance industry were 25% of FHN&#8217;s C&#38;I loan portfolio as of March 31, 2021, and as a result could be affected by items that uniquely impact the financial services in dustry. As of March 31, 2021, FHN did not have any other concentrations of C&#38;I loans in any single industry of 10% or more of total loans. 

Loans to Mortgage Companies 

Loans to mortgage companie s were 16% of th e C&#38;I portfolio as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. This portfolio generally fluctuates with mortgage rates and seasonal factors and includes commercial lines of credit to qualified mortgage companies primarily for the temporary warehousing of eligible mortgage loans prior to the borrower&#8217;s sale of those mortgage loans to third party investors. Generally, new loan originations to mortgage lenders increases when there is a decline in mortgage rates and decreases when rates rise. In periods of economic uncertainty, this trend may not occur even if interest rates are declining. In first quarter 2021, 33% of the loan originations were home purchases and 67% were refinance transactions. 

Finance and Insurance 

The finance and insurance component rep resents 9% of the C&#38;I portfolio as of March 31, 2021 compared to 10% as of December 31, 2020, and includes TRUPs (i.e., long-term unsecured loans to bank and insurance-related businesses), loans to bank holding companies, and asset-based lending to consumer finance companies. As of March 31, 2021, asset-based lending to cons umer finance companies represents approximately $1.2 billion of the finance and insurance component. 

TRUPs lending was originally extended as a form of &#8220;bridge&#8221; financing to participants in the pooled trust preferred securitization program offered primarily to smaller banking (generally less than $15 billion in total assets) and insurance institutions through FHN&#8217;s fixed income business. Origination of TRUPs lending ceased in early 2008. Individual TRUPs are re-graded at least quarterly as part of FHN&#8217;s commercial loan review process. The terms of these loans generally include a scheduled 30 year balloon payoff and include an option to defer interest for up to 20 consecutive quarters. As of March 31, 2021 , the unpaid principal balance (UPB) of trust preferred loans total ed $228 million. Including an amortizing discount of $18 m illion, total reserves (ALLL plus the 

amortizing discount) for TRUPs and other bank-related loans were $28 million, or 12% of ou tstanding UPB. As of March 31, 2021, TRUPs loans included $7 million of loans on nonaccrual, which represented a single loan relationship. 

Paycheck Protection Program 

In 2020, Congress created the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). Under the PPP, qualifying businesses may receive loans from private lenders, such as FHN, that are fully guaranteed by the Small Business Administration. These loans potentially are partly or fully forgivable, depending upon the borrower&#8217;s use of the funds and maintenance of employment levels. To the extent forgiven, the borrower is relieved from payment while the lender is still paid from the program. Congress made revisions to the PPP during first quarter 2021, and may make further revisions in the future. 

At March 31, 2021, FHN had 44,717 of PPP loans with an aggregate principal balance of $5.1 billion. For these loans, FHN anticipates being paid net lender fees of approximately $81 million in relation to the PPP loans held at March 31, 2021. 

Because PPP loans carry a full SBA guarantee, they do not have any credit risk and will not affect the amount of provision and ALLL recorded. As a result, no ALLL is recorded for PPP loans as of March 31, 2021, and FHN has assigned a risk weight of zero to PPP loans for regulatory capital purposes. 

Commercial Real Estate 

The CRE portfolio totaled $12.5 bill ion and $12.3 billion as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively . The CRE portfolio reflects financings for both commercial construction and nonconstruction loans. The largest geographical concentrations of CRE loan balances as of March 31, 2021 were in Florida (28%), Louisiana (11%), Texas (11%), North Carolina (11%), Tennessee (9%), and Georgia (9%). No other state represented more than 5% of the portfolio. This portfolio contains loans, draws on lines, and letters of credit to commercial real estate developers for the construction and mini-permanent financing of income-producing real estate. Sub categories of the CRE portfolio consist of multi-family (27%), office (22%), retail (18%), industrial (11%), hospitality (11%), land/land development (2%), and other (9%).

Consumer Loan Portfolios 

Consumer Real Estate 

The consumer real estate portfolio totaled $11.1 bi llion and $11.7 billion as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively , and is primarily composed of home equity lines and installment loans. The largest geographical concentr ations of balances as of March 31, 2021, were in Florida (32%), Tennessee (25%), Louisiana (10%), North Carolina (8%), and Texas (5%). No other state represented more than 5% of the portfolio. 

As of March 31, 2021, approximately 85% of the consumer real estate portfolio was in a first lien position. At origination, the weighted average FICO score of this portfolio was 753 and the refreshed FICO scores averaged 765 as of March 31, 2021, no significant change from FICO scores of 753 and 763, respectively, as of December 31, 2020. Generally, performance of this portfolio is affected by life events that affect borrowers&#8217; finances, the level of unemployment, and home prices. 

As of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, FHN had held-for-investment consumer mortgage loans secured by real estate that were in the process of foreclosure totaling $34 million and $36 million, respectively. 

HELOCs compris ed $2.3 bill ion of the consumer real estate portfolio as of March 31, 2021. FHN&#8217;s HELOCs typically have a 5 or 10 year draw period followed by a 10 or 20 year repayment period, respectively. During the draw period, a borrower is able to draw on the line and is only required to make interest payments. The line is frozen if a borrower becomes past due on payments. Once the draw period has ended, the line is closed and the borrower is required to make both principal and interest payments monthly until the loan matures. The principal payment generally is fully amortizing, but payment amounts will adjust when variable rates reset to reflect changes in the prime rate. 

As of both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 , approxima tely 86% of FHN's HELOCs were in the draw period. It is expected that $438 million, or 22% of HELOCs currently in the draw period, will enter the repayment period during the next 60 months, based on current terms. Generally, d elinquencies for HELOCs that have entered the repayment period are initially higher than HELOCs still in the draw period because of the increased minimum payment requirement. However, over time, performance of these loans usually begins to stabilize. HELOCs are monitored closely for those nearing the end of the draw perio d. 

The following table presents HELOCs currently in the draw period and expected timing of conversion to the repayment period.

Credit Card and Other 

The credit card and other portfolio, which is primarily within the Regional Banking segment, totaled $1.1 bil lion as of March 31, 2021 and primarily includes co nsumer-related credits, including home equity and other personal consumer loans, c redit card receivables, and automobile loans. There was no 

significant change in the balance of this portfolio from December 31, 2020. 

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses 

Management&#8217;s policy is to maintain the ALLL at a level sufficient to recognize current expected credit losses on the amortized cost basis of the loan and lease portfolio. The total allowance for loan and lease 

FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION 80 

1Q21 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

losses decreased to $914 million on March 31, 2021 from $963 million on December 31, 2020. The ALLL as of March 31, 2021 reflects the improvement in the economic forecast from year-end 2020. As a result, the ratio of ALLL to total loans and leases decreased 9 basis points from December 31, 2020 to 1.56% on March 31, 2021. 

The provision for loan and lease losses is the charge to or release of earnings necessary to maintain the ALLL at a sufficient level reflecting management&#8217;s estimate of current expected losses on the amortized cost basis of the loan and lease portfolio. Provision credit was $41 million in first quarter 2021 compared to a provision expense of $145 million in first quarter 2020. The decrease is primarily attributable to an improving economic forecast, as first quarter 2020 was negatively impacted by the economic uncertainty around the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Asset quality trends may continue to be impacted by the economic uncertainty attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. The C&#38;I portfolio reflects a broad mix of categories with the heaviest concentration in loans to mortgage companies which carry minimal credit risk. The C&#38;I portfolio as of March 31, 2021 includes $5.1 billion of loans made under the Paycheck Protection Program of the SBA. PPP loans are fully government guaranteed with the SBA. Due to the government guarantee and forgiveness provisions, PPP loans are considered to have no credit risk. 

The CRE portfolio metrics may continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic due to travel and occupancy restrictions set by state and local governments affecting the hospitality and retail industries. The consumer portfolio may also continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic if consumer unemployment continues to remain elevated and clients are unable to continue making loan payments. The consumer portfolio, however, is high quality with no subprime and minimal exposure to other traditional categories of high risk lending. 

Consolidated Net Charge-offs 

Net charge-offs in first quarter 2021 we re $8 million, an annualized charge-off percentage of 0.06% of total loans and leases, consistent with net charge-offs of $8 million in first quarter 2020 . 

Net cha rge-offs in first quarter 2021 in the commercial portfolio were $11 million compared to $6 million in first quarter 2020. Net charge-offs were impacted by higher energy charge-offs in the current quarter, as well as a larger commercial portfolio from acquired loans in third quarter 2020. 

Net recoveries in the consumer p ortfolio w ere $3 million in first quarter 2021, driven by consumer real estate recoveries in the Corporate segment, compared to $2 million in net charge-offs in first quarter 2020.

(a) The increase in the ALLL from first quarter 2020 was primarily attributable to the allowance recorded on acquired non-PCD loans and the decline in the economic forecast attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, while the decrease from fourth quarter 2020 was from an improvement in the overall economic forecast. 

(b) The increase in period-end and average loans and leases from 1st quarter 2020 is primarily the result of $26.3 billion in acquired loans and leases in third quarter 2020. 

FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION 82 

1Q21 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

Nonperforming Assets 

Nonperforming loans are loans placed on nonaccrual if it becomes evident that full collection of principal and interest is at risk, if impairment has been recognized as a partial charge-off of principal balance due to insufficient collateral value and past due status, or (on a case-by-case basis), if FHN continues to receive payments but there are other borrower-specific issues. Included in nonaccruals are loans that FHN continues to receive payments, including residential real estate loans where the borrower has been discharged of personal obligation through bankruptcy. NPAs consist of nonperforming loans and OREO (excluding OREO from government insured mortgages). 

Total NPAs (including NPLs HFS) increased to $410 million as of March 31, 2021 from $406 million as of 

December 31, 2020. Despite the marginal increase, the nonperforming assets ratio (nonperforming assets excluding NPLs HFS to total period-end loa ns plus OREO) was 0.69% as of both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The ratio of the ALLL to NPLs was 2.3 times as of March 31, 2021 compared to 2.5 times as of December 31, 2020. 

Certain nonperforming loans in both the commercial and consumer portfolios are deemed collateral-dependent and are charged down to an estimate of collateral value less costs to sell. Because the estimated loss has been recognized through a partial charge-off, typically an ALLL is not recorded.

Lending Assistance for Borrowers 

In addition to PPP loans, other customer support initiatives in response to the COVID-19 pandemic include incremental lending assistance for borrowers through delayed payment programs and fee waivers. 

The following table provides the UPB of loans related to deferrals granted to FHN&#8217;s customers that have been processed through March 31, 2021.

Commercial deferrals were comprised primarily of general commercial (59% or $135 million) and professional commercial real estate (38% or $86 million). 

To the extent that loans were past due at March 31, 2021 or December 31, 2020 and had been granted a deferral, they were excluded from loans past due 30 to 89 days and loans past due 90 days or more in the table and discussion below. 

Past Due Loans and Potential Problem Assets 

Past due loans are loans co ntractually past due as to interest or principal payments, but which have not yet been put on nonaccrual status. Loans in the portfolio that are 90 days or more past due and still accruing were $13 million on March 31, 2021, compared to $17 million on December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by consumer real estate loans. Loans 30 to 89 days past due were $81 million on March 31, 2021, compared to $100 million on December 31, 2020. The decrease included a $14 million decrease in consumer real estate loans, a $12 million decrease in CRE loans, and a $4 million decrease in credit card and other consumer loans, partially offset by an increase in C&#38;I loans past due 30 to 89 days.

Potential problem assets represent those assets where information about possible credit problems of borrowers has caused management to have serious doubts about the borrower&#8217;s ability to comply with present repayment terms and includes loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing. This definition is believed to be substantially consistent with the standards established by Federal banking regulators for loans classified as substandard. Potential problem assets in the loan po rtfolio were $738 million on March 31, 2021 and $718 million on December 31, 2020. The increase in potential problem assets was from a net increase in classified commercial loans within the C&#38;I portfolio from a limited number of 

customer migrations to substandard loans in the current quarter. The current expectation of losses from potential problem assets has been included in management&#8217;s analysis for assessing the adequ acy of the allowance for loan and lease losses. 

Troubled Debt Restructurings and Loan Modifications 

As part of FHN&#8217;s ongoing risk management practices, FHN attempts to work with borrowers when appropriate to extend or modify loan terms to better align with their current ability to repay. Extensions and modifications to loans are made in accordance with 

FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION 86 

1Q21 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

internal policies and guidelines which conform to regulatory guidance. Each occurrence is unique to the borrower and is evaluated separately. In a situation where an economic concession has been granted to a borrower that is experiencing financial difficulty, FHN identifies and reports that loan as a TDR. 

For loan modifications that were made during 2021 and 2020 that met the TDR relief provisions outlined in either the CARES Act, as extended by the CAA, or revised Interagency Guidance, FHN has excluded these modifications from consideration as a TDR, and has excluded loans with these qualifying modifications from designation as a TDR in the 

information and discussion that follows. See Note 4 &#8211; Loans and Leases for further discussion regarding TDRs and loan modifications. 

On March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, FHN had $288 million and $307 million portfolio loans classified as TDRs, respectively. For TDRs in the loan portfolio, FHN had loan loss reserves of $11 million and $12 million, or 4% of TDR balances as of both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Additionally, FHN had $41 million and $42 million of HFS loans classified as TDRs as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 

The following table provides a summary of TDRs for the periods ended March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020:

Investment Securities 

FHN&#8217;s investment portfolio consists principally of debt securities, including government agency issued mortgage-backed securities and government agency issued collateralized mortgage obligations, all of 

which are classified as AFS. The securities portfolio provides a source of income and liquidity and is an important tool used to balance the interest rate risk of the loan and deposit portfolios. The securities portfolio is periodically evaluated in light of established ALM objectives, changing market 

FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION 87 

1Q21 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

conditions that could affect the profitability of the portfolio, the regulatory environment, and the level of interest rate risk to which FHN is exposed. 

Investment securities were $8.4 billion on March 31, 2021, up fr om $8.0 billion on December 31, 2020 and represented approximately 10% of total assets for both periods. See Note 3 - Investment Securities for more information about the securities portfolio, including gross unrealized gains and losses by type 

of security, contractual maturities, and securities pledged. 

Deposits 

Total deposi ts as of March 31, 2021 increased 5% to $73.2 billion from $70.0 billion on December 31, 2020 driven by an increase in non-interest bearing deposits largely reflecting the impact of government stimulus checks and PPP loan funding.

Short-Term Borrowings 

Total short-term borrowings were $2.2 billion as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

Short-term borrowings balances fluctuate largely based on the level of FHLB borrowing as a result of loan demand, deposit levels and balance sheet funding strategies. Federal funds purchased fluctuates depending on the amount of excess funding of FHN&#8217;s correspondent bank customers. Balances of securities sold under agreements to 

resell fluctuate based on cost attractiveness relative to FHLB borrowing levels and the ability to pledge securities toward such transactions. 

Term Borrowings 

Term borrowings include senior and subordinated borrowings with original maturities greater than one year. Term borrowings were $1.7 billion as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

Capital 

Management&#8217;s objectives are to provide capital sufficient to cover the risks inherent in FHN&#8217;s businesses, to maintain excess capital to we ll-capitalized standards, and to assure ready access to the capital markets. Total equity was $8.3 bill ion at both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

S ignificant changes included net income of $236 million which was offset by a decrease in AOCI of $101 million, $92 million in common and preferred dividends, and $62 million in common share repurchases.

1Q21 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

Banking regulators define minimum capital ratios for bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries. Based on the capital rules and definitions prescribed by the banking regulators, should any depository institution&#8217;s capital ratios decline below predetermined levels, it would become subject to a series of increasingly restrictive regulatory actions. 

The system categorizes a depository institution&#8217;s capital position into one of five categories ranging from well-capitalized to critically under-capitalized. For an institution the size of FHN to qualify as well-capitalized, Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 Capital, Total Capital, and Leverage capital ratios must be at least 6.50%, 8.00%, 10.00%, and 5.00%, respectively. Furthermore, a capital conservation buffer of 50 basis points above these levels must be maintained on the Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios to avoid restrictions on dividends, share repurchases and certain discretionary bonuses. 

As of March 31, 2021, each of FHN and First Horizon Bank had sufficien t capital to qualify as well-capitalized instituti ons and to meet the capital conservation buffer requirement. Capital ratios for both FHN and First Horizon Bank are calculated under the final rule issued by the banking regulators in 2020 to delay the effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year transition period. 

For both FHN and First Horizon Bank, the risk-based regulatory capital ratios increased in first quarter 2021 relative to fourth quarter 2020 primarily from the impact of net income less dividends and share repurchases during the first three months of 2021 and a decrease in risk weighted assets, primarily from loan activity. During 2021, capital ratios are expected 

to remain above well-capitalized standards plus the required capital conservation buffer. 

Common Stock Purchase Programs 

General Authority 

Pursuant to Board authority, FHN may repurchase shares of its common stock from time to time and will evaluate the level of capital and take action designed to generate or use capital, as appropriate, for the interests of the shareholders, subject to legal and regulatory restrictions. FHN&#8217;s Board has not authorized a preferred stock purchase program. 

On January 27, 2021, FHN announced that its Board of Directors approved a new $500 million common share purchase program that will expire on January 31, 2023. The new program is not tied to any compensation plan, and replaced the previous general share repurchase program, which was terminated by the Board. Purchases may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, including under Rule 10b5-1 plans as well as accelerated share repurchase and other structured transactions. The timing and exact amount of common share repurchases will be subject to various factors, including FHN's capital position, financial performance, capital impacts of strategic initiatives, market conditions and regulatory considerations. 

As of March 31, 2021, $59 million in purchases had been made under this authority at an average price per share of $16.12, or $16.10 excluding commissions.

1Q21 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

use in connection with two compensation plans for which the share purchase authority had expired. 

The total amount authorized under this consolidated compensation plan share purchase program is 29.6 million shares calculated before adjusting for stock dividends distributed through January 1, 2011. The authorization has been reduced for that portion which relates to compensation plans for which no options remain outstanding. The shares may be purchased over the option exercise period of the various compensation plans on or before 

December 31, 2023. Purchases may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and are subject to various factors including FHN's capital position, financial performance, capital impacts of strategic initiatives, market market conditions and regulatory restrictions. As of March 31, 2021, the maximum number of shares that may be purchased under the program was 23.8 million shares. Management currently does not anticipate purchasing a material number of shares under this authority during 2021.

Risk Management 

There have been no significant changes to FHN&#8217;s risk management practices as described under &#8220;Risk Management&#8221; included in Item 7 of FHN&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT 

Value-at-Risk and Stress Testing 

VaR is a statistical risk measure used to estimate the potential loss in value from adverse market movements over an assumed fixed holding period within a stated confidence level. FHN employs a model to compute daily VaR measures for its trading 

securities inventory. FHN computes VaR using historical simulation with a 1-year lookback period at a 99% confidence level and 1-day and 10-day time horizons. Additionally, FHN computes a Stressed VaR measure. The SVaR computation uses the same model but with model inputs reflecting historical data from a continuous 12-month period that reflects a period of significant financial stress appropriate for our trading securities portfolio. 

FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION 91 

1Q21 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

A summary of FHN&#8217;s VaR and SVaR measures for 1-day and 10-day time horizons is as follows:

FHN&#8217;s overall VaR measure includes both interest rate risk and credit spread risk. Separate measures of these component risks are as follows: 

Table 19&#8212;Schedule of Risks Included in VaR 

&#160; As of March 31, 2021 As of March 31, 2020 As of December 31, 2020 (Dollars in millions) 1-day 10-day 1-day 10-day 1-day 10-day Interest rate risk $ 1 &#160; $ 2 &#160; $ 1 $ 3 $ 1 $ 2 Credit spread risk &#8212; &#160; 1 &#160; 2 12 2 6 

The potential risk of loss reflected by FHN&#8217;s VaR measures assumes the trading securities inventory is static. Because FHN Financial procures fixed income securities for purposes of distribution to clients, its trading securities inventory turns over regularly. Additionally, FHNF traders actively manage the trading securities inventory continuously throughout each trading day. Accordingly, FHN&#8217;s trading securities inventory is highly dynamic, rather than 

static. As a result, it would be rare for FHNF to incur a negative revenue day in its fixed income activities of the level indicated by its VaR measurements. 

In addition to being used in FHN&#8217;s daily market risk management process, the VaR and SVaR measures are also used by FHN in computing its regulatory market risk capital requirements in accordance with the Market Risk Capital rules. For additional

FHN also performs stress tests on its trading securities portfolio to calculate the potential loss under various assumed market scenarios. Key assumed stresses used in those tests are: 

Down 25 bps - assumes an instantaneous downward move in interest rates of 25 basis points at all points on the interest rate yield curve. 

Up 25 bps - assumes an instantaneous upward move in interest rates of 25 basis points at all points on the interest rate yield curve. 

Curve flattening - assumes an instantaneous flattening of the interest rate yield curve through an increase in short-term rates and a decrease in long-term rates. The 2-year point on the Treasury yield curve is assumed to increase 15 basis points and the 10-year point on the Treasury yield curve is assumed to decrease 15 basis points. Shifts in other points on the yield curve are predicted based on their correlation to the 2-year and 10-year points. 

Curve steepening - assumes an instantaneous steepening of the interest rate yield curve through a decrease in short-term rates and an increase in long-term rates. The 2-year point on the Treasury yield curve is assumed to decrease 15 basis points and the 10-year point on the Treasury yield curve is assumed to increase 15 basis points. Shifts in other points on the yield curve are predicted based on their correlation to the 2-year and 10-year points. 

Credit spread widening - assumes an instantaneous increase in credit spreads (the difference between yields on Treasury securities and non-Treasury securities) of 25 basis points. 

Model Validation 

Trading risk management personnel within FHN Financial have primary responsibility for model risk management with respect to the model used by FHN to compute its VaR measures and perform stress testing on the trading inventory. Among other procedures, these personnel monitor model results and perform periodic backtesting as part of an ongoing process of validating the accuracy of the model. These model risk management activities are subject to annual review by FHN&#8217;s Model Validation Group, an independent assurance group charged with oversight responsibility for FHN&#8217;s model risk management. 

INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT 

Net Interest Income Simulation Analysis 

The information provided in this section, including the discussion regarding the outcomes of simulation analysis and rate shock analysis, is forward-looking. Actual results, if the assumed scenarios were to occur, could differ because of interest rate movements, the ability of management to execute its business plans, and other factors, including those presented in the Forward-Looking Statements section of this Report. 

Management uses a simulation model to measure interest rate risk and to formulate strategies to improve balance sheet positioning, earnings, or both, within FHN&#8217;s interest rate risk, liquidity, and capital guidelines. Interest rate exposure is measured by forecasting 12 months of NII under various interest rate scenarios and comparing the percentage change in NII for each scenario to a base case scenario where interest rates remain unchanged. Assumptions are made regarding future balance sheet composition, interest rate movements, and loan and deposit pricing. In addition, assumptions are made about the magnitude of asset prepayments and earlier than anticipated deposit withdrawals. The results of these scenarios help FHN develop strategies for managing exposure to interest rate risk. While management believes the assumptions used and scenarios selected in its simulations are reasonable, simulation modeling provides only an estimate, not a precise calculation, of exposure to any given change in interest rates. 

Based on a static balance sheet as of March 31, 2021, NII expo sures over the next 12 months assuming rate shocks of plus 25 basis points, 50 basis points, 100 basis points, and 200 basis points are estimated to have favorable variances of 2.5%, 4.7%, 9.3%, and 16.0%, respectively compared to base NII. A steepening yield curve scenario where long-term rates increase by 50 basis points and short-term rates are static, results in a favorable NII variance o f 0.7% . A flattening yield curve scenario where long-term rates decrease by 50 basis points and short-term rates are static, results in an unfavorable NII variance o f 0.9%. Rate shocks of minus 25 basis points and 50 basis points result in unfavorable NII variances of 1.7% and 2.0%, assuming the absence of negative rates. These hypothetical scenarios are used to create a risk measurement framework, and do not necessarily represent management&#8217;s current view of future interest rates or market developments. 

FHN&#8217;s net interest income has been, and likely will continue to be, impacted by the disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic and the low rate environment. 

FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION 93 

1Q21 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

The increase in the unemployment rate, client loan deferral requests, the impact of government assistance programs, and other developments have influenced net interest income results. FHN is monitoring current economic trends and potential exposures closely. 

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT 

Among other things, ALCO is responsible for liquidity management: the funding of assets with liabilities of appropriate duration, while mitigating the risk of unexpected cash needs. ALCO and the Board of Directors have adopted a Liquidity Policy of which the objective is to ensure that FHN meets its cash and collateral obligations promptly, in a cost-effective manner and with the highest degree of reliability. The maintenance of adequate levels of asset and liability liquidity should provide FHN with the ability to meet both expected and unexpected cash and collateral needs. Key liquidity ratios, asset liquidity levels and the amount available from funding sources are reported to ALCO on a regular basis. FHN&#8217;s Liquidity Policy establishes liquidity limits that are deemed appropriate for FHN&#8217;s risk profile. 

In accordance with the Liquidity Policy, ALCO manages FHN&#8217;s exposure to liquidity risk through a dynamic, real time forecasting methodology. Base liquidity forecasts are reviewed by ALCO and are updated as financial conditions dictate. In addition to the baseline liquidity reports, robust stress testing of assumptions and funds availability are periodically reviewed. FHN maintains a contingency funding plan that may be executed, should unexpected difficulties arise in accessing funding that affects FHN, the industry, or both. Subject to market conditions and compliance with applicable regulatory requirements from time to time, funds are available from a number of sources including the available-for-sale securities portfolio, dealer and commercial customer repurchase agreements, access to the overnight and term Federal F unds markets, incremental borrowing capacity at the FHL B ($13.9 billion was available as of March 31, 2021), brokered deposits, loan sales, syndications, and access to the Federal Reserve Bank. 

Core deposits are a significant source of funding and have historically been a stable source of liquidity for banks. Generally, core deposits represent funding from a financial institution's customer base which provide inexpensive, predictable pricing. The ratio of total loans, excludi ng loans HFS and restricted real estate loans, to core deposits was 86% for March 31, 2021 and 97% for December 31, 2020. 

FHN may also use unsecured short-term borrowings as a source of liquidity. Federal funds purchased from correspondent bank clients are considered to be 

substantially more stable than funds purchased in the national broker markets for federal funds due to the long, historical, and reciprocal nature of banking services provided by FHN to these correspondent banks. The remainder of FHN&#8217;s wholesale short-term borrowings consists of securities sold under agreements to repurchase transactions accounted for as secured borrowings with business clients or broker dealer counterparties. 

Both FHN and First Horizon Bank have the ability to generate liquidity by issuing senior or subordinated unsecured debt, preferred equity and common equity, subject to market conditions and compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. As of March 31, 2021, FHN had outstanding $1.3 billion in senior and subordinated unsecured debt and $470 million in non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock. As of March 31, 2021, First Horizon Bank and subsidiaries had outstanding preferred shares of $295 million, which are reflected as noncontrolling interest on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Parent company liquidity is primarily provided by cash flows stemming from dividends and interest payments collected from subsidiaries. These sources of cash represent the primary sources of funds to pay cash dividends to shareholders and principal and interest to debt holders of FHN. Applying the dividend restrictions imposed under applicable federal and state rules as outlined above, the Bank&#8217;s total amount available for dividends was $969 million as of April 1, 2021. First Horizon Bank declared and paid common dividends to the parent company in the amount of $183 million in first quarter 2021 and $65 million in first quarter 2020. First Horizon Bank declared preferred dividends in the first quarter of 2021 which were payable in April 2021 and declared and paid preferred dividends in each quarter of 2020. 

Payment of a dividend to shareholders of FHN is dependent on several factors which are considered by the Board. These factors include FHN&#8217;s current and prospective capital, liquidity, and other needs, applicable regulatory restrictions, and availability of funds to FHN through a dividend from First Horizon Bank. Additionally, banking regulators generally require insured banks and bank holding companies to pay cash dividends only out of current operating earnings. Consequently, the decision of whether FHN will pay future dividends and the amount of dividends will be affected by current operating results. FHN paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per common share on April 1, 2021. FHN paid cash dividends of $1,550 per Series A preferred share and $1,625 per Series E preferred share on April 12, 2021 and $165 per Series C preferred share and $305 per Series D preferred share on May 3, 2021. In addition, in April 2021, the Board approved cash dividends per share in the following amounts:

Repurchase Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

Prior to September 2008, FHN originated loans through its pre-2009 mort gage business, primarily first lien home loans, with the intention of selling them. As discussed in Note 11 - Contingencies and Other Disclosures, FHN's principal remaining exposures for those activities relate to (i) indemnification claims by underwriters, loan purchasers, and other parties which assert that FHN-originated loans caused or contributed to losses which FHN is legally obliged to indemnify, and (ii) indemnification or other claims related to FHN's servicing of pre-2009 mortgage loans. 

FHN&#8217;s approach for determining the adequacy of the repurchase and foreclosure reserve has evolved, sometimes substantially, based on changes in information available. Repurchase/make-whole rates vary based on purchaser, vintage, and claim type. For those loans repurchased or covered by a make-whole payment, cumulative average loss severities range between 50 and 60 percent of the UPB. 

Repurchase Accrual Approach 

In determining potential loss content, claims are analyzed by purchaser, vintage, and claim type. FHN considers various inputs including claim rate estimates, historical average repurchase and loss severity rates, mortgage insurance cancellations, and mortgage insurance curtailment requests. Inputs are applied to claims in the active pipeline, as well as to historical average inflows to estimate loss content related to potential future inflows. Management also evaluates the nature of claims from purchasers and/or servicers of loans sold to determine if qualitative adjustments are appropriate. 

Repurchase and Foreclosure Liability 

FHN&#8217;s repurchase and foreclosure liability, primarily related to its pre-2009 mortgage business, is comprised of accruals to cover estimated loss content 

in the active pipeline (consisting of mortgage loan repurchase, make-whole, foreclosure/servicing demands and certain related exposures), estimated future inflows, and estimated loss content related to certain known claims not currently included in the active pipeline. The liability contemplates repurchase/make-whole and damages obligations and estimates for probable incurred losses associated with loan populations excluded from the settlements with the GSEs, as well as other whole loans sold, mortgage insurance cancellations rescissions, and loans included in bulk servicing sales effected prior to the settlements with the GSEs. FHN compares the estimated probable incurred losses determined under the applicable loss estimation approaches for the respective periods with current reserve levels. Changes in the estimated required liability levels are recorded as necessary through the repurchase and foreclosure provision. The repurchase and foreclosure liability was $16 million as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

In the normal course of business, FHN is a party to a number of activities that contain credit, market and operational risk that are not reflected in whole or in part in the consolidated financial statements. Such activities include traditional off-balance sheet credit-related financial instruments. FHN provides customers with off-balance sheet credit support through loan commitments, lines of credit, and standby letters of credit. Many of the commitments are expected to expire unused or be only partially used; therefore, the total amount of commitments does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Based on its available liquidity and available borrowing capacity, FHN anticipates it will continue to have sufficient funds to meet its current commitments.

1Q21 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

Market Uncertainties and Prospective Trends 

FHN&#8217;s future results could be affected both positively and negatively by several known trends. Key among those are changes in the U.S. and global economy and outlook, government actions affecting interest rates, and the availability and administration of stimulus relief for the economy. Additional impacts include how the pandemic affects FHN&#8217;s clients, as well as political uncertainty, potential changes in federal policies and the potential impact to our clients, and FHN&#8217;s strategic initiatives. The global COVID-19 pandemic has led to periods of significant volatility in financial commodities (including oil and gas) and other markets, and has adversely affected FHN&#8217;s and its clients' ability to conduct normal business, and could harm FHN&#8217;s business and future results of operations. 

In March 2020, the Federal Reserve lowered short-term interest rates twice and started a &#8220;quantitative easing&#8221; program intended to lower longer-term interest rates and foster access to credit. The effective yields of 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury securities achieved record low rates and the U.S. Congress enacted relief legislation which, among other things, was intended to provide emergency credit to businesses at risk for failure from government and public actions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and to mitigate the severity of an economic recession. These changes in interest rates and the volatility in the market negatively impacted FHN&#8217;s net interest margin. Amortization of net processing fees related to government relief programs, including the Paycheck Protection Program, has offset a portion of the net interest margin decline. 

COVID-19 Pandemic 

Government and societal reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic caused extraordinary disruption to the U.S. economy, as well as to the local economies within FHN's footprint, during the final three quarters of 2020 and continuing into the first quarter of 2021. Business activity, especially lending, declined throughout 2020 and into first quarter this year. In certain business lines, FHN reduced or stopped new lending because of the pandemic. 

In the fourth quarter of 2020, two extremely effective vaccines were approved in the U.S. Administration of those vaccines began late in 2020, nationwide but on a narrowly targeted basis. In the first quarter of 2021, vaccine production and distribution increased, and a third vaccine was approved in the U.S. Public vaccination in the U.S. has accelerated during the first four months of 2021. In many of FHN's markets, COVID-19 restrictions at least partially were eased by the end of March or during April, and FHN believes further easing is likely in the rest of 2021. COVID-19 restrictions still had a substantial impact on FHN and its clients in the first quarter of 2021, but FHN expects those impacts to diminish over the rest of this year as the vaccinated percentage of the U.S. population continues to climb. Within the U.S. economy, broadly speaking, manufacturing has largely recovered while services continue to lag significantly, especially in hospitality and leisure. 

Risk of resurgence remains as new virus variants continue to be identified around the world. As a result, FHN continues to closely monitor the pandemic and its effects on clients, especially credit quality, on FHN's communities, and on the financial markets. FHN continues to reach out to clients to discuss challenges and solutions, to provide line draws and new extensions to existing clients, to provide support for small businesses through the Paycheck Protection Program and other stimulus programs, and to provide lending and deposit assistance through deferrals and waived fees. 

LIBOR Reform 

In 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR), announced that it intends to halt persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. 

In March 2021, the United Kingdom&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority (the &#8220;FCA&#8221;), the governmental regulator of the administrator of LIBOR, announced that U.S. Dollar LIBOR will no longer be representative as of: 

&#8226; One week and two month USD LIBOR after December 31, 2021; and 

&#8226; All other USD LIBOR tenors (e.g., overnight, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month tenors) after June 30, 2023. 

FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION 96 

1Q21 FORM 10-Q REPORT 

The administrator of LIBOR thereafter announced that USD LIBOR will cease to be published immediately after the dates set out above. 

Previous to these announcements, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation issued SR 20-27 to encourage banks to transition away from U.S. dollar LIBOR as soon as practicable and noted that entering into new contracts that use LIBOR as a reference rate after December 31, 2021 would create safety and soundness risks. As a result, market participants will be required to transition away from LIBOR beginning in 2021. FHN is not currently able to predict the impact that the transition from LIBOR will have on FHN; however, because FHN has instruments with floating rate terms based on LIBOR, FHN may experience increases in interest, dividends, and other costs relative to these instruments subsequent to 2021. Additionally, the transition from LIBOR could impact or change FHN&#8217;s hedge accounting practices. 

FHN has initiated efforts to 1) develop an inventory of affected loans, securities, and derivatives, 2) evaluate and assess modifications as needed to address loans outstanding at the time of LIBOR discontinuance, 3) obtain an understanding of the potential effects for applicable securities and derivatives, 4) assess revisions to systems, processes, and pricing needed to implement alternative reference rates, and 5) update fallback language for all new loans that reference LIBOR. 

In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, &#8220;Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting,&#8221; which provides several optional expedients and exceptions to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate 

reform. The scope of ASU 2020-04 was expanded with the January 2021 issuance of ASU 2021-01, "Scope". Refer to the Accounting Changes Issued but Not Currently Effective section of Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies for additional information. Additionally, the IRS has released guidance that is intended to facilitate the transition of existing contracts from LIBOR to new reference rates without triggering modification accounting or taxable exchange treatment for those contracts. This guidance specifies what must be met in order to qualify for the beneficial transition approach and FHN is considering this guidance in its transition plans. 

Limited Data Security Incident 

In mid-April, FHN became aware of a data security incident affecting a limited number of customer accounts. Based on its ongoing investigation, FHN determined that an unauthorized party had obtained login credentials from an unknown source and attempted access to client accounts. Using the credentials and exploiting a vulnerability in third-party security software, the unauthorized party gained unauthorized access to under 200 on-line client bank accounts, had access to personal information in those accounts, and fraudulently obtained an aggregate of less than $1 million from some of those accounts. FHN has remediated the software vulnerability, reset the passwords for the identified accounts, is working with the affected clients to close existing accounts and open new ones, has reimbursed clients for the stolen funds, and has notified the appropriate regulators and enforcement authorities. Based on its ongoing assessment of the incident to date, FHN does not believe that this event will have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations, or financial condition. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

FHN has made no significant changes in its critical accounting policies and estimates from those disclosed in its 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
