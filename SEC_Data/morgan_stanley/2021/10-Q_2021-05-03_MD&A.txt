Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Executive Summary 

Overview of Financial Results 

Consolidated Results&#8212;Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 

&#8226; Firm Net revenues were up 61% and Net income applicable to Morgan Stanley was up 143%, with strong contributions from each of our three business segments, and resulting in an annualized ROTCE of 21.1%, or 21.4% excluding integration-related expenses (see &#8220;Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information&#8221; herein). 

&#8226; Institutional Securities Net revenues of $8.6 billion increased 66% reflecting strength across businesses and geographies on continued strong client engagement and higher volumes in a constructive market environment, notwithstanding losses related to a single client event in the quarter. 

&#8226; Wealth Management delivered pre-tax income of $1.6 billion with a pre-tax profit margin of 26.9%, or 27.9% excluding integration-related expenses (see &#8220;Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information&#8221; herein). Results reflect strong levels of client engagement, net new assets of $105 billion and fee-based flows of $37 billion, in addition to growth in bank lending. 

&#8226; Investment Management results reflect strong asset management fees on AUM of $1.4 trillion due to strong investment performance and positive flows across all asset classes, as well as the impact of the Eaton Vance acquisition. 

&#8226; The Firm expense efficiency ratio was 66.6%, or 66.1% excluding the impact of integration-related expenses (see &#8220;Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information&#8221; herein). 

&#8226; At March 31, 2021, our standardized Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 16.7%. 

&#8226; The Firm repurchased $2.1 billion of its outstanding common stock. 

Strategic Transactions 

&#8226; On March 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Eaton Vance. For further information, see &#8220;Business Segments&#8212;Investment Management&#8221; herein.

Earnings per Diluted Common Share 1 

1. Adjusted Diluted EPS for the current quarter was $2.22 (see &#8220;Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information&#8221; herein). 

We reported net revenues of $15.7 billion in the quarter ended March 31, 2021 (&#8220;current quarter,&#8221; or &#8220;1Q 2021&#8221;), compared with $9.8 billion in the quarter ended March 31, 2020 (&#8220;prior year quarter,&#8221; or &#8220;1Q 2020&#8221;). For the current quarter, net income applicable to Morgan Stanley was $4.1 billion, or $2.19 per diluted common share, compared with $1.7 billion or $1.01 per diluted common share, in the prior year quarter.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Non-interest Expenses 1, 2 

($ in millions) 

1. The percentages on the bars in the chart represent the contribution of compensation and benefits expenses and non-compensation expenses to the total. 

2. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. See &#8220;Business Segments&#8221; herein and Note 1 to the financial statements for more information. 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses of $6,798 million in the current quarter increased 59% from the prior year quarter, primarily as a result of increases in discretionary incentive compensation and the formulaic payout to Wealth Management representatives, both driven by higher revenues, higher expenses related to certain deferred compensation plans linked to investment performance and the Firm&#8217;s share price, and incremental compensation as a result of the E*TRADE and Eaton Vance acquisitions. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expenses of $3,675 million in the current quarter increased 25% from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by incremental expenses as a result of the E*TRADE and Eaton Vance acquisitions, in addition to higher volume-related expenses and higher investments in technology. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments was a net release of $98 million in the current quarter primarily driven by improvements in the outlook for macroeconomic conditions and the impact of paydowns on Corporate loans, including by lower-rated borrowers. The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $407 million in the prior year quarter was primarily driven by deterioration in the current and expected macroeconomic environment at that time. For further information on the Provision for credit losses, see &#8220;Credit Risk&#8221; herein. 

Income Taxes 

The increase in the Firm&#8217;s effective tax rate in the current quarter is primarily due to the lower impact of net discrete tax benefits. Net discrete tax benefits in the current quarter of $86 million and $130 million in the prior year quarter were primarily related to the conversion of employee share-based awards.

1. The percentages on the bars in the charts represent the contribution of each business segment to the total of the applicable financial category and may not sum to 100% due to intersegment eliminations. See Note 20 to the financial statements for details of intersegment eliminations. 

2. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. See &#8220;Business Segments&#8221; herein and Note 1 to the financial statements for more information. 

&#8226; Institutional Securities net revenues of $8,577 million in the current quarter increased 66% from the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting higher revenues in equity underwriting driven by higher volumes, as well as higher revenues in credit products and equity derivatives. The current quarter included a loss of $644 million related to a credit event for a single client, and $267 million of subsequent trading losses through the end of the quarter related to the same event. 

&#8226; Wealth Management net revenues of $5,959 million in the current quarter increased 47% primarily due to higher transactional revenues reflecting gains from investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans, as well as higher asset management revenues on increased asset levels and positive fee-based flows. Net

interest also increased primarily reflecting incremental revenues as a result of the E*TRADE acquisition. 

&#8226; Investment Management net revenues of $1,314 million in the current quarter increased 90% from the prior year quarter, due to higher Asset management and related fees driven by higher average AUM and the effect of the Eaton Vance acquisition, and higher Performance-based income and other revenues, driven by higher accrued carried interest.

($ in millions) 

1. The percentages on the bars in the charts represent the contribution of each region to the total.

Americas revenues increased 62%, primarily driven by the Wealth Management and the Institutional Securities business segments.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Coronavirus Disease (&#8220;COVID-19&#8221;) Pandemic 

The COVID-19 pandemic and related voluntary and government-imposed social and business restrictions have had, and will likely continue to have, a significant impact on global economic conditions and the environment in which we operate our businesses. The Firm continues to be fully operational, with approximately 90% of employees in the Americas and globally working from home as of March 31, 2021. 

Though we are unable to estimate the extent of the impact, the economic or other effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may have adverse impacts on our future operating results. Refer to &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; and &#8220;Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; in the 2020 Form 10-K for more information. 

Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information 

We prepare our financial statements using U.S. GAAP. From time to time, we may disclose certain &#8220;non-GAAP financial measures&#8221; in this document or in the course of our earnings releases, earnings and other conference calls, financial presentations, definitive proxy statement and otherwise. A &#8220;non-GAAP financial measure&#8221; excludes, or includes, amounts from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We consider the non-GAAP financial measures we disclose to be useful to us, investors, analysts and other stakeholders by providing further transparency about, or an alternate means of assessing or comparing our financial condition, operating results and capital adequacy. 

These measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, U.S. GAAP and may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Whenever we refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, we will also generally define it or present the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, along with a reconciliation of the differences between the U.S. GAAP financial measure and the non-GAAP financial measure. 

The principal non-GAAP financial measures presented in this document are set forth in the following tables.

1. Adjusted amounts exclude the effect of costs related to the integration of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance, net of tax as appropriate. The pre-tax adjustments were as follows: Wealth Management &#8211; Compensation expenses of $30 million and Non-compensation expenses of $34 million, Investment Management &#8211; Compensation expenses of $3 million and Non-compensation expenses of $8 million. 

2. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. See &#8220;Business Segments&#8221; herein and Note 1 to the financial statements for more information. 

3. ROE and ROTCE represent earnings applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders as a percentage of average common equity and average tangible common equity, respectively. When excluding integration-related costs, both the numerator and average denominator are adjusted. 

4. Average common equity and average tangible common equity for each business segment is determined using our Required Capital framework (see "Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Regulatory Requirements&#8212;Attribution of Average Common Equity According to the Required Capital Framework&#8221; herein). The sums of the segments' Average common equity and Average tangible common equity do not equal the Consolidated measures due to Parent equity. 

5. The calculation of ROE and ROTCE by segment uses net income applicable to Morgan Stanley by segment less preferred dividends allocated to each segment as a percentage of average common equity and average tangible common equity, respectively, allocated to each segment. 

Return on Tangible Common Equity Target 

In January 2021, we established a 2-year ROTCE Target of 14% to 16%, excluding integration-related expenses. 

Our ROTCE Target is a forward-looking statement that was based on a normal market environment and may be materially affected by many factors, including, among other things: mergers and acquisitions; macroeconomic and market conditions; legislative, accounting, tax and regulatory developments; industry trading and investment banking volumes; equity market levels; interest rate environment; outsized legal expenses or penalties; the ability to control expenses; and capital levels. 

Given the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is uncertain if the ROTCE Target will be met within the originally stated time frame. See &#8220;Coronavirus Disease (COVID&#8211;19) Pandemic&#8221; herein and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in the 2020 Form 10-K for further information on market and economic conditions and their effects on our financial results. 

For further information on non-GAAP measures (ROTCE excluding integration-related expenses), see &#8220;Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information&#8221; herein. 

Business Segments 

Substantially all of our operating revenues and operating expenses are directly attributable to our business segments. Certain revenues and expenses have been allocated to each business segment, generally in proportion to its respective net revenues, non-interest expenses or other relevant measures. See Note 20 to the financial statements for information on intersegment transactions. 

For an overview of the components of our business segments, net revenues, compensation expense and income taxes, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Business Segments&#8221; in the 2020 Form 10-K. 

As part of our effort to continually improve the transparency and comparability of our external financial reporting, several updates to our financial presentation were implemented in the first quarter of 2021. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. 

Provision for credit losses 

The Provision for credit losses for loans and lending commitments is now presented as a separate line in the income statements. Previously, the provision for credit losses for loans was included in Other revenues and the provision for credit losses for lending commitments was included in Other expense. 

Other revenues 

Gains and losses on economic derivative hedges associated with certain held-for-sale and held-for-investment corporate loans, which were previously reported in Trading revenues, are now reported within Other revenues in the income statements. The new presentation better aligns with the recognition of mark-to-market gains and losses on held-for-sale loans which continue to be reported in Other revenues. 

Institutional Securities 

Equity&#8212;Financing, Equity&#8212;Execution services and Fixed income now include certain Investments and Other revenues to the extent directly attributable to those businesses. The remaining Investments and Other revenues not included in those businesses&#8217; results are reported in Other. Other also includes revenues previously reported as Other Sales and Trading. 

Investment Management 

We have renamed the previously disclosed revenue line Asset management to Asset management and related fees and have combined the remaining revenue lines into a new category named Performance-based income and other.

Equity 

Net revenues of $2,875 million in the current quarter increased 17% compared with the prior year quarter, reflecting an increase in execution services, partially offset by a decrease in financing. 

&#8226; Financing revenues decreased, primarily driven by a loss of $644 million, related to a credit event for a single client, partially offset by higher average client balances and higher client activity. 

&#8226; Execution services revenues increased, primarily in derivatives due to the impact of market conditions on inventory held to facilitate client activity and higher client activity. Partially offsetting this increase was $267 million of trading losses related to the same credit event. 

March 2021 Form 10-Q 7 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Fixed Income 

Net revenues of $2,966 million in the current quarter increased 44% compared with the prior year quarter, primarily driven by credit products. 

&#8226; Global macro products revenues decreased in both foreign exchange and rates products primarily due to the effect of tighter bid-offer spreads compared with the prior year quarter, partially offset by the impact of market conditions on inventory held to facilitate client activity. 

&#8226; Credit products revenues increased primarily due to the impact of market conditions on inventory held to facilitate client activity in securitized products, corporate credit products and municipal securities. In addition, higher client activity in securitized products was partially offset by the effect of tighter bid-offer spreads in corporate credit products compared with the prior year quarter. 

&#8226; Commodities products and other fixed income revenues increased primarily driven by higher counterparty credit risk management results. 

Other Net Revenues 

Net revenues of $123 million in the current quarter increased 126% compared with the prior year quarter primarily due to lower mark-to-market losses on corporate loans held for sale, net of related economic hedges, and gains from investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans compared with losses in the prior year quarter. 

Net Interest 

Net interest revenues of $638 million in the current quarter are included within Equity, Fixed Income, and Other, and increased 38% compared with the prior year quarter primarily driven by lower net costs associated with maintaining liquidity as well as higher revenues in corporate lending and secured lending facilities. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments was a net release of $93 million in the current quarter primarily driven by improvements in the outlook for macroeconomic conditions and the impact of paydowns on Corporate loans, including by lower-rated borrowers. The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $388 million in the prior year quarter was primarily driven by deterioration in the current and expected macroeconomic environment at that time. For further information on the Provision for credit losses, see &#8220;Credit Risk&#8221; herein. 

Non-interest Expenses 

Non-interest expenses of $5,299 million in the current quarter increased 38% compared with the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting a 72% increase in Compensation and benefits expenses. 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses increased, primarily due to increases in discretionary incentive compensation driven by higher revenues, and higher expenses related to certain deferred compensation plans linked to investment performance. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expenses increased, primarily reflecting an increase in volume-related expenses and higher investments in technology. 

Income Tax Items 

Net discrete tax benefits of $52 million and $66 million, were recognized in Provision for income taxes in the current quarter and the prior year quarter, respectively.

Net Revenues

See &#8220;Fee-Based Client Assets&#8212;Rollforwards&#8221; herein. 

March 2021 Form 10-Q 9 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Transactional Revenues 

Transactional revenues of $1,228 million in the current quarter increased substantially compared with the prior year quarter, primarily due to gains from investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans, and incremental revenues as a result of the E*TRADE acquisition. 

Net Interest 

Net interest of $1,385 million increased 55% compared with the prior year quarter, primarily due to incremental Net interest as a result of the E*TRADE acquisition, improved prepayment amortization related to mortgage-backed securities, growth in bank lending and increases in investment portfolio balances driven by higher brokerage sweep deposits. These increases were partially offset by the net effect of lower interest rates. 

Other 

Other revenues of $155 million in the current quarter increased 91% compared with the prior year quarter, primarily due to incremental revenues as a result of the E*TRADE acquisition. 

Non-interest Expenses 

Non-interest expenses of $4,364 million in the current quarter increased 46% compared with the prior year quarter, primarily as a result of higher Compensation and benefits expenses and Non-compensation expenses. 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses increased primarily due to higher expenses related to certain deferred compensation plans linked to investment performance, an increase in the formulaic payout to Wealth Management representatives driven by higher compensable revenues and incremental compensation as a result of the E*TRADE acquisition. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expenses increased primarily due to incremental operating and other expenses as a result of the E*TRADE acquisition.

Acquisition of Eaton Vance 

On March 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Eaton Vance via the issuance of approximately $5.3 billion of common shares and cash consideration of approximately $3.4 billion. The combination increases the capabilities and scale of our investment management franchise, and positions the Investment Management business segment as a premier asset manager. From the acquisition date onward, the business activities of Eaton Vance have been reported within the Investment Management business segment, the substantial majority of which are within Asset management and related fees. The comparisons of current year results to prior periods are impacted by this acquisition. For additional information on the acquisition of Eaton Vance, see Note 3 to the financial statements. 

Net Revenues 

Asset Management and related fees 

Asset management and related fees of $1,103 million in the current quarter increased 66% compared with the prior year quarter, primarily as a result of higher average AUM, driven by strong investment performance and positive net flows across all asset classes, as well as incremental revenues as a result of the Eaton Vance acquisition. 

See &#8220;Assets Under Management or Supervision&#8221; herein. 

Performance-based income and other 

Performance-based income and other revenues of $211 million in the current quarter increased compared with the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher accrued carried interest, particularly in real estate funds. 

Non-interest Expenses 

Non-interest expenses of $944 million in the current quarter increased 72% compared with the prior year quarter as a result of higher Compensation and benefits expenses and higher Non-compensation expenses. 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses increased in the current quarter primarily due to higher discretionary incentive compensation driven by higher revenues, higher compensation associated with carried interest, and incremental compensation as a result of the Eaton Vance acquisition. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expenses in the current quarter increased compared with the prior year quarter primarily due to higher fee sharing paid to intermediaries driven by higher average AUM, as well as incremental expenses as a result of the Eaton Vance acquisition.

We believe that of our significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to the financial statements in the 2020 Form 10-K and Note 2 to the financial statements), the fair value, goodwill and intangible assets, legal and regulatory contingencies and income taxes policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. For a further discussion about our critical accounting policies, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Critical Accounting Policies&#8221; in the 2020 Form 10-K. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, our acquisition of Eaton Vance on March 1, 2021 included indefinite lived intangible assets. The initial valuation of an intangible asset, including indefinite lived intangible assets, as part of the acquisition method of accounting and the subsequent valuation of intangible assets as part of impairment assessments are subjective and based, in part, on inputs that are unobservable. These inputs include, but are not limited to, forecasted cash flows, revenue growth rates, attrition rates and discount rates. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Senior management, with oversight by the Asset/Liability Management Committee and the Board of Directors (&#8220;Board&#8221;), establishes and maintains our liquidity and capital policies. Through various risk and control committees, senior management reviews business performance relative to these policies, monitors the availability of alternative sources of financing, and oversees the liquidity, interest rate and currency sensitivity of our asset and liability position. Our Treasury department, Firm Risk Committee, Asset/Liability Management Committee, and other committees and control groups assist in evaluating, monitoring and controlling the impact that our business activities have on our balance sheet, liquidity and capital structure. Liquidity and capital matters are reported regularly to the Board and the Risk Committee of the Board. 

Balance Sheet 

We monitor and evaluate the composition and size of our balance sheet on a regular basis. Our balance sheet management process includes quarterly planning, business-specific thresholds, monitoring of business-specific usage versus key performance metrics and new business impact assessments. 

We establish balance sheet thresholds at the consolidated and business segment levels. We monitor balance sheet utilization and review variances resulting from business activity and market fluctuations. On a regular basis, we review current performance versus established thresholds and assess the need to re-allocate our balance sheet based on business unit needs. We also monitor key metrics, including asset and liability size and capital usage.

1. Amounts include loans held for investment, net of allowance, and loans held for sale but exclude loans at fair value, which are included in Trading assets in the balance sheets (see Note 10 to the financial statements). 

2. Other assets primarily includes Goodwill and Intangible assets, premises, equipment and software, ROU assets related to leases, other investments, and deferred tax assets. 

A substantial portion of total assets consists of liquid marketable securities and short-term receivables. In the Institutional Securities business segment, these arise from sales and trading activities, and in the Wealth Management business segment, these arise from banking activities, including management of the investment portfolio, comprising Investment securities, Cash and cash equivalents and Securities purchased under agreements to resell. Total assets increased slightly to $1,159 billion at March 31, 2021 from $1,116 billion at December 31, 2020. 

Liquidity Risk Management Framework 

The core components of our Liquidity Risk Management Framework are the Required Liquidity Framework, Liquidity Stress Tests and Liquidity Resources, which support our target liquidity profile. For a further discussion about the Firm&#8217;s Required Liquidity Framework and Liquidity Stress Tests, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Liquidity Risk Management Framework&#8221; in the 2020 Form 10-K. 

At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, we maintained sufficient liquidity to meet current and contingent funding obligations as modeled in our Liquidity Stress Tests. 

Liquidity Resources 

We maintain sufficient liquidity resources, which consist of HQLA and cash deposits with banks (&#8220;Liquidity Resources&#8221;) to cover daily funding needs and to meet strategic liquidity targets sized by the Required Liquidity Framework and Liquidity Stress Tests. The total amount of Liquidity Resources is actively managed by us considering the following components: unsecured debt maturity profile; balance sheet size and composition; funding needs in a stressed environment, inclusive of contingent cash outflows; legal entity, regional and segment liquidity requirements; regulatory requirements; and collateral requirements. 

The amount of Liquidity Resources we hold is based on our risk tolerance and is subject to change depending on market and Firm-specific events. The Liquidity Resources are primarily held within the Parent Company and its major operating subsidiaries. The Total HQLA values in the tables immediately following are different from Eligible HQLA, which, in accordance with the LCR rule, also takes into account certain regulatory weightings and other operational considerations.

March 2021 Form 10-Q 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Liquidity Resources may fluctuate from period to period based on the overall size and composition of our balance sheet, the maturity profile of our unsecured debt and estimates of funding needs in a stressed environment, among other factors. 

Regulatory Liquidity Framework 

Liquidity Coverage Ratio 

The Firm, MSBNA and MSPBNA are required to comply with, and subject to a transition period, ETB will be required to comply with, LCR requirements, including a requirement to calculate each entity&#8217;s LCR on each business day. The requirements are designed to ensure that banking organizations have sufficient Eligible HQLA to cover net cash outflows arising from significant stress over 30 calendar days, thus promoting the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of banking organizations. In determining Eligible HQLA for LCR purposes, weightings (or asset haircuts) are applied to HQLA, and certain HQLA held in subsidiaries is excluded. 

As of March 31, 2021, the Firm, MSBNA and MSPBNA are compliant with the minimum required LCR of 100%.

$ 216,875 &#160; $ 206,105 LCR 125 &#160; % 129 % 

1. Under the LCR rule, Eligible HQLA is calculated using weightings and excluding certain HQLA held in subsidiaries. 

2. Primarily includes U.S. Treasuries, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, sovereign bonds and investment grade corporate bonds. 

Net Stable Funding Ratio 

The U.S. banking agencies have finalized a rule to implement the NSFR, which requires large banking organizations to maintain sufficiently stable sources of funding over a one-year time horizon, and will apply to us, MSBNA, MSPBNA and ETB. As of March 31, 2021, we estimate we are compliant with the 100% minimum NSFR and that we will be in compliance with the final rule on July 1, 2021, the effective date of the requirements. 

Funding Management 

We manage our funding in a manner that reduces the risk of disruption to our operations. We pursue a strategy of diversification of secured and unsecured funding sources (by product, investor and region) and attempt to ensure that the tenor of our liabilities equals or exceeds the expected holding period of the assets being financed. 

We fund our balance sheet on a global basis through diverse sources. These sources include our equity capital, borrowings, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, securities lending, deposits, letters of credit and lines of credit. We have active financing programs for both standard and structured products targeting global investors and currencies. 

Secured Financing 

For a discussion of our secured financing activities, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Funding Management&#8212;Secured Financing&#8221; in the 2020 Form 10-K.

In addition to the collateralized financing transactions shown in the previous table, we engage in financing transactions collateralized by customer-owned securities, which are segregated in accordance with regulatory requirements. Receivables under these financing transactions, primarily margin loans, are included in Customer and other receivables in the balance sheets, and payables under these financing transactions, primarily to prime brokerage customers, are included in Customer and other payables in the balance sheets. Our risk exposure on these transactions is mitigated by collateral maintenance policies and the elements of our Liquidity Risk Management Framework.

This client cash held by third parties is not reflected in our balance sheets and is not immediately available for liquidity purposes. 

Deposits are primarily sourced from our Wealth Management clients and are considered to have stable, low-cost funding characteristics. The increase in total deposits in the current quarter was primarily due to the onboarding of approximately $20 billion of E*TRADE Brokerage sweep deposits previously held off-balance sheet at unaffiliated financial institutions.

&#160; 

$ 18,976 &#160; 

1. Original maturity in the table is generally based on contractual final maturity. For borrowings with put options, remaining maturity represents the earliest put date. 

2. Includes only borrowings with original maturities greater than one year. 

Borrowings of $216 billion as of March 31, 2021 were relatively unchanged when compared with $217 billion at December 31, 2020. 

We believe that accessing debt investors through multiple distribution channels helps provide consistent access to the unsecured markets. In addition, the issuance of borrowings with original maturities greater than one year allows us to reduce reliance on short-term credit sensitive instruments. Borrowings with original maturities greater than one year are generally managed to achieve staggered maturities, thereby mitigating refinancing risk, and to maximize investor diversification through sales to global institutional and retail clients across regions, currencies and product types. 

The availability and cost of financing to us can vary depending on market conditions, the volume of certain trading and lending activities, our credit ratings and the overall availability of credit. We also engage in, and may continue to 

engage in, repurchases of our borrowings in the ordinary course of business. 

For further information on Borrowings, see Note 13 to the financial statements. 

Credit Ratings 

We rely on external sources to finance a significant portion of our daily operations. The cost and availability of financing generally are impacted by our credit ratings, among other things. In addition, our credit ratings can have an impact on certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where longer-term counterparty performance is a key consideration, such as certain OTC derivative transactions. When determining credit ratings, rating agencies consider both company-specific and industry-wide factors. These include regulatory or legislative changes, the macroeconomic environment and perceived levels of support, among other things. See also &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212; Liquidity Risk&#8221; in the 2020 Form 10-K.

Incremental Collateral or Terminating Payments 

In connection with certain OTC derivatives and certain other agreements where we are a liquidity provider to certain financing vehicles associated with the Institutional Securities business segment, we may be required to provide additional collateral, immediately settle any outstanding liability balances with certain counterparties or pledge additional collateral to certain clearing organizations in the event of a future credit rating downgrade irrespective of whether we are in a net asset or net liability position. See Note 7 to the financial statements for additional information on OTC derivatives that contain such contingent features. 

While certain aspects of a credit rating downgrade are quantifiable pursuant to contractual provisions, the impact it 

March 2021 Form 10-Q 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

would have on our business and results of operations in future periods is inherently uncertain and would depend on a number of interrelated factors, including, among other things, the magnitude of the downgrade, the rating relative to peers, the rating assigned by the relevant agency pre-downgrade, individual client behavior and future mitigating actions we might take. The liquidity impact of additional collateral requirements is included in our Liquidity Stress Tests. 

Capital Management 

We view capital as an important source of financial strength and actively manage our consolidated capital position based upon, among other things, business opportunities, risks, capital availability and rates of return together with internal capital policies, regulatory requirements and rating agency guidelines. In the future, we may expand or contract our capital base to address the changing needs of our businesses.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We enter into various off-balance sheet arrangements, including through unconsolidated SPEs and lending-related financial instruments (e.g., guarantees and commitments), primarily in connection with the Institutional Securities and Investment Management business segments. 

We utilize SPEs primarily in connection with securitization activities. For information on our securitization activities, see Note 16 to the financial statements in the 2020 Form 10-K. 

For information on our commitments, obligations under certain guarantee arrangements and indemnities, see Note 14 to the financial statements.

Regulatory Requirements 

Regulatory Capital Framework 

We are an FHC under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (&#8220;BHC Act&#8221;), and are subject to the regulation and oversight of the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements for us, including &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; standards, and evaluates our compliance with such capital requirements. Regulatory capital requirements established by the Federal Reserve are largely based on the Basel III capital standards established by the Basel Committee and also implement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (&#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;). The OCC establishes similar capital requirements and standards for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries. For us to remain an FHC, we must remain well-capitalized in accordance with standards established by the Federal Reserve, and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries must remain well-capitalized in accordance with standards established by the OCC. For additional information on regulatory capital requirements for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries, see Note 16 to the financial statements. 

Regulatory Capital Requirements 

We are required to maintain minimum risk-based and leverage-based capital and TLAC ratios. For more information, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Regulatory Capital Requirements&#8221; in

the 2020 Form 10-K. For additional information on TLAC, see &#8220;Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Requirements&#8221; herein. 

Risk-Based Regulatory Capital. Minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements apply to Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital (which includes Tier 2 capital). Capital standards require certain adjustments to, and deductions from, capital for purposes of determining these ratios.

1. For additional information on the SCB, see &#8220;Capital Plans, Stress Tests and the Stress Capital Buffer&#8221; herein and in the 2020 Form 10-K. 

2. For a further discussion of the G-SIB capital surcharge, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Regulatory Requirements&#8212;G-SIB Capital Surcharge&#8221; in the 2020 Form 10-K. 

3. The CCyB can be set up to 2.5%, but is currently set by the U.S. banking agencies at zero. 

4. The capital buffer requirement represents the amount of Common Equity Tier 1 capital we must maintain above the minimum risk-based capital requirements in order to avoid restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. Our Standardized Approach capital buffer requirement is equal to the sum of our SCB, G-SIB capital surcharge and CCyB, and our Advanced Approach capital buffer requirement is equal to our 2.5% capital conservation buffer, G-SIB capital surcharge and CCyB. 

5. Required ratios represent the regulatory minimum plus the capital buffer requirement. 

Our risk-based capital ratios are computed under both (i) the standardized approaches for calculating credit risk and market risk RWA (&#8220;Standardized Approach&#8221;) and (ii) the applicable advanced approaches for calculating credit risk, market risk and operational risk RWA (&#8220;Advanced Approach&#8221;). The credit risk RWA calculations between the two approaches differ in that the Standardized Approach requires calculation of RWA using prescribed risk weights, whereas the Advanced Approach utilizes models to calculate exposure amounts and risk weights. At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the difference between the actual and required ratio was lower under the Standardized Approach. 

Leverage-Based Regulatory Capital. Minimum leverage-based capital requirements include a Tier 1 leverage ratio and an SLR. We are required to maintain an SLR of 5%, inclusive of an enhanced SLR capital buffer of at least 2%. 

As of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, our risk-based and leverage-based capital amounts and ratios, as well as RWA, adjusted average assets and supplementary leverage exposure are calculated excluding the effect of the adoption of CECL based on our election to defer this effect over a five-year transition period which began in 2020. For further information, see &#8220;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Regulatory Requirements&#8212;Regulatory Developments&#8221; in the 2020 Form 10-K.

1. Required ratios are inclusive of any buffers applicable as of the date presented. Failure to maintain the buffers would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. 

2. Adjusted average assets represents the denominator of the Tier 1 leverage ratio and is composed of the average daily balance of consolidated on-balance sheet assets for the quarters ending on the respective balance sheet dates, reduced by disallowed goodwill, intangible assets, investments in covered funds, defined benefit pension plan assets, after-tax gain on sale from assets sold into securitizations, investments in our own capital instruments, certain deferred tax assets and other capital deductions. 

3. Supplementary leverage exposure is the sum of Adjusted average assets used in the Tier 1 leverage ratio and other adjustments, primarily: (i) for derivatives, potential future exposure and the effective notional principal amount of sold credit protection offset by qualifying purchased credit protection; (ii) the counterparty credit risk for repo-style transactions; and (iii) the credit equivalent amount for off-balance sheet exposures. 

4. Based on a Federal Reserve interim final rule that was in effect until March 31, 2021, our SLR and Supplementary leverage exposure as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 reflect the exclusion of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks. As of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the impact of the interim final rule on our SLR was an increase of 73 bps and 80 bps, respectively.

Regulatory VaR&#8212;VaR for regulatory capital requirements 

1. Amounts reflect assets not in a defined category, non-material portfolios of exposures and unsettled transactions, as applicable. 

Credit risk RWA decreased in the current quarter under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches. Under the Standardized Approach, the decrease was driven primarily by loans, partially due to syndications, and Securities financing transactions. Under the Advanced Approach, the decrease was driven by Derivatives as a result of reduced exposure and a reduction in CVA due to lower credit spread volatility and decreased counterparty exposure. 

Market risk RWA increased in the current quarter under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches primarily due to an increase in Regulatory VaR and Stressed VaR mainly as a result of higher equity and interest rate risk. 

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Requirements 

The Federal Reserve has established external TLAC, long-term debt (&#8220;LTD&#8221;) and clean holding company requirements for top-tier BHCs of U.S. G-SIBs (&#8220;covered BHCs&#8221;), including the Parent Company. These requirements are designed to ensure that covered BHCs will have enough loss-absorbing resources at the point of failure to be recapitalized through the conversion of eligible LTD to equity or otherwise by imposing losses on eligible LTD or other forms of TLAC where an SPOE resolution strategy is used.

1. Required ratios are inclusive of applicable buffers. The final rule imposes TLAC buffer requirements on top of both the risk-based and leverage exposure-based external TLAC minimum requirements. The risk-based TLAC buffer is equal to the sum of 2.5%, our Method 1 G-SIB surcharge and the CCyB, if any, as a percentage of total RWA. The leverage exposure-based TLAC buffer is equal to 2% of our total leverage exposure. Failure to maintain the buffers would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. 

2. External TLAC consists of Common Equity Tier 1 capital and Additional Tier 1 capital (each excluding any noncontrolling minority interests), as well as eligible LTD. 

3. Consists of TLAC-eligible LTD reduced by 50% for amounts of unpaid principal due to be paid in more than one year but less than two years from each respective balance sheet date. 

We are in compliance with all TLAC requirements as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. For a further discussion of TLAC and related requirements, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Regulatory Requirements&#8212;Regulatory Capital Requirements&#8212;Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Requirements&#8221; in the 2020 Form 10-K. 

Capital Plans, Stress Tests and the Stress Capital Buffer 

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve has adopted capital planning and stress test requirements for large BHCs, which form part of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s annual CCAR framework. 

We must submit, on at least an annual basis, a capital plan to the Federal Reserve, taking into account the results of separate annual stress tests designed by us and the Federal Reserve, so that the Federal Reserve may assess our systems and processes that incorporate forward-looking projections of revenues and losses to monitor and maintain our internal capital adequacy. As banks with less than $250 billion of total assets, our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are not subject to company-run stress test regulatory requirements. 

For the 2021 capital planning and stress test cycle, we submitted our capital plan and company-run stress test results to the Federal Reserve on April 5, 2021. The Federal Reserve is expected to publish summary results of the CCAR and Dodd-Frank Act supervisory stress tests of each large BHC, including us, by June 30, 2021. We are required to disclose a summary of the results of our company-run stress tests within 

March 2021 Form 10-Q 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

15 days of the date the Federal Reserve discloses the results of the supervisory stress tests. 

For additional information on our capital planning and stress tests, including the SCB, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Capital Plans, Stress Tests and the Stress Capital Buffer&#8221; in the 2020 Form 10-K. 

Capital Action Supervisory Restrictions 

Under the modified capital action restrictions announced on December 18, 2020 by the Federal Reserve, large BHCs were permitted, in the first quarter of 2021, to take certain capital actions. In particular, a firm was able to, provided that it did not increase the amount of its common stock dividends to be larger than the level paid in the second quarter of 2020, pay common stock dividends and make share repurchases that, in the aggregate, did not exceed an amount equal to the average of the firm&#8217;s net income for the four preceding calendar quarters; make share repurchases that equal the amount of share issuances related to expensed employee compensation; and redeem and make scheduled payments on additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments. 

Consistent with these modifications, on December 18, 2020, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10 billion of outstanding common stock in 2021. 

On March 25, 2021, the Federal Reserve announced that its temporary capital action supervisory restrictions will end on June 30, 2021 for all firms whose capital levels are above minimum risk-based requirements in the Federal Reserve&#8217;s annual supervisory stress test. 

For additional information, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Capital Action Supervisory Restrictions&#8221; in the 2020 Form 10-K. 

Attribution of Average Common Equity According to the Required Capital Framework 

Our required capital (&#8220;Required Capital&#8221;) estimation is based on the Required Capital framework, an internal capital adequacy measure. Common equity attribution to the business segments is based on capital usage calculated under the Required Capital framework, as well as each business segment&#8217;s relative contribution to our total Required Capital. 

The Required Capital framework is a risk-based and leverage-based capital measure, which is compared with our regulatory capital to ensure that we maintain an amount of going concern capital after absorbing potential losses from stress events, where applicable, at a point in time. The amount of capital allocated to the business segments is generally set at the beginning of each year and remains fixed throughout the year until the next annual reset unless a significant business change occurs ( e.g ., acquisition or disposition). We define the difference between our total average common equity and the 

sum of the average common equity amounts allocated to our business segments as Parent common equity. We generally hold Parent common equity for prospective regulatory requirements, organic growth, potential future acquisitions and other capital needs.

3. The total average common equity and the allocation to the Investment Management business segment in 2021 reflect the Eaton Vance acquisition on March 1, 2021. 

The Firm has made updates to its Required Capital framework for 2021 and continues to evaluate the impact of evolving regulatory requirements, as appropriate. As noted above, common equity attribution to the business segments is based upon usage. 

Resolution and Recovery Planning 

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, we are required to periodically submit to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a resolution plan that describes our strategy for a rapid and orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the event of our material financial distress or failure. Our next resolution plan submission will be a targeted resolution plan in July 2021. 

As described in our most recent resolution plan, which was submitted on June 28, 2019, our preferred resolution strategy is an SPOE strategy. In line with our SPOE strategy, the Parent Company has transferred, and has agreed to transfer on an ongoing basis, certain assets to its wholly owned, direct subsidiary Morgan Stanley Holdings LLC (the &#8220;Funding IHC&#8221;). In addition, the Parent Company has entered into an amended and restated support agreement with its material entities (including the Funding IHC) and certain other subsidiaries. In the event of a resolution scenario, the Parent Company would be obligated to contribute all of its Contributable Assets to our material entities and/or the Funding IHC. The Funding IHC would be obligated to provide capital and liquidity, as applicable, to our material entities. The combined implication of the SPOE resolution strategy and the requirement to maintain certain levels of TLAC is that losses in resolution would be imposed on the holders of eligible long-term debt and other forms of eligible TLAC issued by the Parent Company before any losses are imposed on creditors of our material entities or before putting U.S. taxpayers at risk.

Regulatory Developments and Other Matters 

Expiration of the Supplementary Leverage Ratio Interim Final Rule 

On March 19, 2021, the Federal Reserve announced that the temporary change to the SLR for bank holding companies, which allowed for the exclusion of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks, would expire as scheduled on March 31, 2021, resulting in the elimination of this exclusion beginning in the second quarter of 2021. For a summary of the impact of this interim final rule, see &#8220;Regulatory Capital Requirements&#8221; herein. 

Planned Replacement of London Interbank Offered Rate and Replacement or Reform of Other Interest Rates 

Central banks around the world, including the Federal Reserve, have commissioned committees and working groups of market participants and official sector representatives to replace LIBOR and replace or reform other interest rate benchmarks (collectively, the &#8220;IBORs&#8221;). On March 5, 2021, ICE Benchmark Administration, which administers LIBOR publication, announced that it will cease the publication of most LIBOR rates as of the end of December 2021, except for the publication until June 30, 2023 of the most widely used U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors, and the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (&#8220;FCA&#8221;), which regulates LIBOR publication, announced that it would not compel panel banks to submit to LIBOR beyond those dates. 

Subsequently, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (&#8220;ISDA&#8221;) confirmed that the FCA's announcement constituted an &#8220;Index Cessation Event&#8221; as defined in the IBOR Fallbacks Supplement, which amended ISDA's interest rate definitions to include robust fallbacks for derivatives linked to LIBOR and certain other interest rate benchmarks, and the ISDA 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol, which incorporates the fallbacks into legacy non-cleared derivatives entered into between Protocol adherents. The FCA's announcement therefore triggered a fixing of the ISDA fallback spread adjustments for all LIBOR benchmarks, to be effective when the contractual fallbacks are implemented. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (&#8220;ARRC&#8221;) also confirmed that the ICE Benchmark Administration and FCA announcements also constituted a &#8220;Benchmark Transition Event&#8221; with respect to all USD LIBOR settings pursuant to 

the ARRC&#8217;s fallback recommendations for new issuances or originations of certain cash products. 

Separately, the U.S. banking agencies and the FCA have encouraged banks to cease entering into new contracts referencing LIBOR as soon as practicable, and no later than December 31, 2021. 

Further, New York State has enacted legislation that would, among other things, replace LIBOR references in certain contracts governed by New York law with a benchmark based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, including any spread adjustment, recommended by the Federal Reserve, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the ARRC. 

We remain a party to a significant number of LIBOR-linked contracts, many of which extend beyond 2021 and, in the case of U.S. dollar LIBOR, June 30, 2023, composed of derivatives, securitizations, floating rate notes, loans and mortgages and we continue to execute on our Firm-wide IBOR transition plan to promote the transition to alternative reference rates in accordance with industry transition timelines, which is overseen by a global steering committee, with senior management oversight. See also &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risk Management&#8221; in the 2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion of risks related to the planned replacement of the IBORs and/or reform of interest rate benchmarks.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk 

Management believes effective risk management is vital to the success of our business activities. For a discussion of our Enterprise Risk Management framework and risk management functions, see &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk&#8212;Risk Management&#8221; in the 2020 Form 10-K. 

Market Risk 

Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, spreads, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as market liquidity, will result in losses for a position or portfolio. Generally, we incur market risk as a result of trading, investing and client facilitation activities, principally within the Institutional Securities business segment where the substantial majority of our VaR for market risk exposures is generated. In addition, we incur non-trading market risk, principally within the Wealth Management and Investment Management business segments. The Wealth Management business segment primarily incurs non-trading market risk (including interest rate risk) from lending and deposit-taking activities. The Investment Management business segment primarily incurs non-trading market risk from capital investments in alternative and other funds. For a further discussion of market risk, see &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk&#8212;Market Risk&#8221; in the 2020 Form 10-K. 

Trading Risks 

We are exposed to a wide range of risks related to interest rates and credit spreads, equity prices, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices, and the associated implied volatilities and spreads, related to the global markets in which we conduct our trading activities. 

The statistical technique known as VaR is one of the tools we use to measure, monitor and review the market risk exposures of our trading portfolios. 

For information regarding our primary risk exposures and market risk management, VaR methodology, assumptions and limitations, see &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk&#8212;Market Risk&#8212;Trading Risks&#8221; in the 2020 Form 10-K.

This benefit arises because the simulated one-day losses for each of the components occur on different days; similar diversification benefits also are taken into account within each component. 

2. The high and low VaR values for the total Management VaR and each of the component VaRs might have occurred on different days during the quarter, and therefore, the diversification benefit is not an applicable measure. 

Average total Management VaR and average Management VaR for the Primary Risk Categories increased in the current quarter from the three months ended December 31, 2020 primarily as a result of increased exposure across trading businesses in support of client activity. During the current quarter, Management VaR peaked at $175 million for one day driven by increased equity exposure resulting from the aforementioned credit event for a single client. 

Distribution of VaR Statistics and Net Revenues 

We evaluate the reasonableness of our VaR model by comparing the potential declines in portfolio values generated by the model with corresponding actual trading results for the Firm, as well as individual business units. For days where losses exceed the VaR statistic, we examine the drivers of trading losses to evaluate the VaR model&#8217;s accuracy relative to realized trading results. There were four loss days in the current quarter, none of which were in excess of the Firm&#8217;s VaR.

Daily Net Trading Revenues for the Current Quarter 

($ in millions) 

The previous histogram shows the distribution of daily net trading revenues for the current quarter. Daily net trading revenues include profits and losses from Interest rate and credit spread, Equity price, Foreign exchange rate, Commodity price, and Credit Portfolio positions and intraday trading activities for our trading businesses. Certain items such as fees, commissions, net interest income, and counterparty default risk are excluded from daily net trading revenues and the VaR model. Revenues required for Regulatory VaR backtesting further exclude intraday trading. 

Non-Trading Risks 

We believe that sensitivity analysis is an appropriate representation of our non-trading risks. The following sensitivity analyses cover substantially all of the non-trading risk in our portfolio.

The previous table presents an analysis of selected instantaneous upward and downward parallel interest rate shocks (subject to a floor of zero percent in the downward scenario) on net interest income over the next 12 months for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries. These shocks are applied to our 12-month forecast for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries, which incorporates market expectations of interest rates and our forecasted business activity. 

We do not manage to any single rate scenario but rather manage net interest income in our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries to optimize across a range of possible outcomes, including non-parallel rate change scenarios. The sensitivity analysis assumes that we take no action in response to these scenarios, assumes there are no changes in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates, and includes subjective assumptions regarding customer and market re-pricing behavior and other factors. The lower sensitivity to interest rates in the negative 100 basis point scenario between March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 was primarily driven by changes in market rates.

The market risk related to these investments is measured by estimating the potential reduction in net income associated with a 10% decline in investment values and related impact on performance-based

fees, as applicable. The change in investments sensitivity related to Investment Management activities between March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 was primarily driven by incremental investments acquired in the Eaton Vance transaction and across private equity funds due to increased sensitivity to carried interest. 

Asset Management Revenue Sensitivity 

Certain asset management revenues in the Wealth Management and Investment Management business segments are derived from management fees, which are based on fee-based client assets in Wealth Management or AUM in Investment Management (together, &#8220;client holdings&#8221;). The assets underlying client holdings are primarily composed of equity, fixed income and alternative investments, and are sensitive to changes in related markets. The overall level of these revenues depends on multiple factors that include, but are not limited to, the level and duration of a market increase or decline, price volatility, the geographic and industry mix of client assets, and client behavior such as the rate and magnitude of client investments and redemptions. Therefore, overall revenues do not correlate completely with changes in the related markets. 

Credit Risk 

Credit risk refers to the risk of loss arising when a borrower, counterparty or issuer does not meet its financial obligations to us. We are primarily exposed to credit risk from institutions and individuals through our Institutional Securities and Wealth Management business segments. For a further discussion of our credit risks, see &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk&#8212;Credit Risk&#8221; in the 2020 Form 10-K.

1. Investment Management business segment loans are related to certain of our activities as an investment advisor and manager. At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, loans held at fair value are predominantly the result of the consolidation of CLO vehicles, managed by Investment Management, composed primarily of senior secured loans to corporations. 

2. FVO also includes the fair value of certain unfunded lending commitments. 

3. Lending commitments represent the notional amount of legally binding obligations to provide funding to clients for lending transactions. Since commitments associated with these business activities may expire unused or may not be utilized to full capacity, they do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements. 

We provide loans and lending commitments to a variety of customers, including large corporate and institutional clients, as well as high to ultra-high net worth individuals. In addition, we purchase loans in the secondary market. Loans and lending commitments are either held for investment, held for sale or carried at fair value. For more information on these loan classifications, see Note 2 to the financial statements in the 2020 Form 10-K. 

Total loans and lending commitments increased by approximately $15 billion since December 31, 2020, primarily due to growth in event-driven loans and lending commitments within the Institutional Securities business segment, and an increase in Securities-based loans and Residential real estate loans within the Wealth Management business segment. 

See Notes 5, 6, 10 and 14 to the financial statements for further information. 

Beginning late in the first quarter of 2020 and following in part from the U.S. government&#8217;s enactment of the CARES Act, we have received requests from certain clients for modifications of their credit agreements with us, which in some cases include deferral of their loan payments. Initial borrower requests for loan payment deferrals related to Residential real estate loans are granted, while those related to Commercial real estate loans require careful consideration prior to approval. As of March 31, 2021, the outstanding principal balance of loans with approved deferrals of principal 

March 2021 Form 10-Q 25 

Risk Disclosures 

and interest payments currently in place which are not classified as troubled debt restructurings amounted to approximately $300 million for our Institutional Securities business segment and approximately $200 million for our Wealth Management business segment. Incremental to this population, throughout 2020 and the current quarter, we have provided deferrals of principal and interest on approximately $3.2 billion of loans which have now exited such modification arrangements. The substantial majority of these loans are current as of March 31, 2021. 

In addition to these principal and interest deferrals, we are working with clients regarding modifications of certain other terms under their original loan agreements that do not impact contractual loan payments. We have granted such relief to certain borrowers, primarily within Secured lending facilities and Corporate loans. Such modifications include agreements to modify margin calls for Secured lending facilities, typically in return for additional payments that improve LTV ratios. In some cases, we have agreed to temporarily not enforce certain covenants, for example debt or interest coverage ratios, typically in return for other structural enhancements. 

Granting loan deferral or modification requests does not necessarily mean that we will incur credit losses, and we do not believe modifications have had a material impact on the risk profile of our loan portfolio. Modifications are considered in our evaluation of overall credit risk. Generally, loans with payment deferrals remain on accrual status, and loans with other modifications remain on current status. 

Requests for deferrals and other modifications could continue in future periods given the ongoing uncertain global economic and market conditions. See &#8220;Executive Summary&#8212;Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic&#8221; herein and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; and &#8220;Forward Looking Statements&#8221; in the 2020 Form 10-K. 

For additional information on regulatory guidance which permits certain loan modifications for borrowers impacted by COVID-19 to not be accounted for and reported as TDRs as well as the Firm&#8217;s accounting policies for such modifications, see &#8220;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Regulatory Requirements&#8212;Regulatory Developments&#8221; and Note 2 to the financial statements in the 2020 Form 10-K, respectively. For information on HFI loans on nonaccrual status and HFI loans modified and reported as TDRs, see &#8220;Status of Loans Held for Investment&#8221; herein and Note 10 to the financial statements, and for a discussion of the related accounting policies see Note 2 to the financial statements in the 2020 Form 10-K.

1. At December 31, 2020, the ACL for Loans and Lending commitments was $835 million and $396 million, respectively. 

2. In the current quarter, the Provision for credit losses on loans was a release of $58 million and the Provision for credit losses on lending commitments was a release of $40 million. 

Credit exposure arising from our loans and lending commitments is measured in accordance with our internal risk management standards. Risk factors considered in determining the aggregate allowance for loan and commitment losses include the borrower&#8217;s financial strength, industry, facility structure, LTV ratio, debt service ratio, collateral and covenants. Qualitative and environmental factors such as economic and business conditions, nature and volume of the portfolio and lending terms, and volume and severity of past due loans may also be considered. 

The aggregate allowance for loans and lending commitments decreased in the current quarter, primarily reflecting a release in the allowance for credit losses within the Institutional Securities business segment. The allowance release was primarily a result of improvements in the outlook for macroeconomic conditions and the impact of paydowns on Corporate loans, including by lower-rated borrowers. The base scenario used in our ACL models as of March 31, 2021 was generated using a combination of industry consensus economic forecasts, forward rates, and internally developed and validated models. Given the nature of our lending portfolio, the most sensitive model input is U.S. gross domestic product. The base scenario, among other things, assumes a continued recovery over the forecast period with U.S. GDP reaching pre-COVID-19 levels by the third quarter of 2021, supported by fiscal stimulus and accommodative monetary policy. See Notes 10 and 14 to the financial statements for further information. See Note 2 to the financial statements in the 2020 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm&#8217;s ACL methodology under CECL.

Sectors Currently in Focus due to COVID-19 

The continuing effect on economic activity of COVID-19 and related governmental actions have impacted borrowers in many sectors and industries. While we are carefully monitoring all of our Institutional Securities business segment exposures, certain sectors are more sensitive to the current economic environment and are continuing to receive heightened focus. The sectors currently in focus are: air travel, retail, upstream energy, lodging and leisure, and healthcare services and systems. As of March 31, 2021, exposures to these sectors are included across the Industrials, Financials, Real estate, Consumer discretionary, Energy and Healthcare industries in the previous table, and in aggregate represent less than 10% of total Institutional Securities business segment lending exposure. Further, as of March 31, 2021, approximately 90% of these exposures are either investment grade and/or secured by collateral. The future developments of COVID-19 and related government actions and their effect on the economic environment remain uncertain; therefore, the sectors impacted and the extent of the impacts may change over time. Refer to &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in the 2020 Form 10-K. 

Institutional Securities Lending Activities 

The Institutional Securities business segment lending activities include Corporate, Secured lending facilities, Commercial real estate and Securities-based lending and Other. Over 90% of our total lending exposure, which consists of loans and lending commitments, is investment grade and/or secured by collateral. For a description of Institutional Securities&#8217; lending activities, see &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk&#8212;Credit Risk&#8221; in the 2020 Form 10-K.

The Institutional Securities and Wealth Management business segments provide margin lending arrangements that allow customers to borrow against the value of qualifying securities, primarily for the purpose of purchasing additional securities, as well as to collateralize short positions. Institutional Securities primarily includes margin loans in the Equity Financing business. Wealth Management includes margin loans as well as non-purpose securities-based lending on non-bank entities. 

Margin lending activities generally have lower credit risk due to the value of collateral held and their short-term nature. Amounts may fluctuate from period to period as overall client balances change as a result of market levels, client positioning and leverage.

We are exposed to credit risk as a dealer in OTC derivatives. Credit risk with respect to derivative instruments arises from the possibility that a counterparty may fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. For more information on derivatives, see &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk&#8212;Credit Risk&#8212;Derivatives&#8221; in the 2020 Form 10-K and Note 7 to the financial statements.

Risk Disclosures 

Country Risk 

Country risk exposure is the risk that events in, or that affect, a foreign country (any country other than the U.S.) might adversely affect us. We actively manage country risk exposure through a comprehensive risk management framework that combines credit and market fundamentals and allows us to effectively identify, monitor and limit country risk. For a further discussion of our country risk exposure see, &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk&#8212;Country and Other Risks&#8221; in the 2020 Form 10-K. 

Our sovereign exposures consist of financial contracts and obligations entered into with sovereign and local governments. Our non-sovereign exposures consist of financial contracts and obligations entered into primarily with corporations and financial institutions. 

Index credit derivatives are included in the following country risk exposure table. Each reference entity within an index is allocated to that reference entity&#8217;s country of risk. Index exposures are allocated to the underlying reference entities in proportion to the notional weighting of each reference entity in the index, adjusted for any fair value receivable or payable for that reference entity. Where credit risk crosses multiple jurisdictions, for example, a CDS purchased from an issuer in a specific country that references bonds issued by an entity in a different country, the fair value of the CDS is reflected in the Net Counterparty Exposure row based on the country of the CDS issuer. Further, the notional amount of the CDS adjusted for the fair value of the receivable or payable is reflected in the Net Inventory row based on the country of the underlying reference entity.

1. Net inventory represents exposure to both long and short single-name and index positions ( i.e ., bonds and equities at fair value and CDS based on a notional amount assuming zero recovery adjusted for the fair value of any receivable or payable). 

2. Net counterparty exposure ( e.g ., repurchase transactions, securities lending and OTC derivatives) is net of the benefit of collateral received and also is net by counterparty when legally enforceable master netting agreements are in place. For more information, see &#8220;Additional Information&#8212;Top 10 Non-U.S. Country Exposures&#8221; herein. 

3. Amounts represent net CDS hedges (purchased and sold) on net counterparty exposure and lending executed by trading desks responsible for hedging counterparty and lending credit risk exposures. Amounts are based on the CDS notional amount assuming zero recovery adjusted for any fair value receivable or payable. For further description of the contractual terms for purchased credit protection and whether they may limit the effectiveness of our hedges, see &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk&#8212;Credit Risk&#8212;Derivatives&#8221; in the 2020 Form 10-K.

Risk Disclosures 

Operational Risk 

Operational risk refers to the risk of loss, or of damage to our reputation, resulting from inadequate or failed processes or systems, from human factors or from external events ( e.g. , fraud, theft, legal and compliance risks, cyber attacks or damage to physical assets). We may incur operational risk across the full scope of our business activities, including revenue-generating activities ( e.g. , sales and trading) and support and control groups ( e.g. , information technology and trade processing). For a further discussion about our operational risk, see &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk&#8212;Operational Risk&#8221; in the 2020 Form 10-K. In addition, for further information on market and economic conditions and their effects on risk in general, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Executive Summary&#8212;Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic&#8221; herein and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in the 2020 Form 10-K. 

Model Risk 

Model risk refers to the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs. Model risk can lead to financial loss, poor business and strategic decision making or damage to our reputation. The risk inherent in a model is a function of the materiality, complexity and uncertainty around inputs and assumptions. Model risk is generated from the use of models impacting financial statements, regulatory filings, capital adequacy assessments and the formulation of strategy. For a further discussion about our model risk, see &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk&#8212;Model Risk&#8221; in the 2020 Form 10-K. 

Liquidity Risk 

Liquidity risk refers to the risk that we will be unable to finance our operations due to a loss of access to the capital markets or difficulty in liquidating our assets. Liquidity risk also encompasses our ability (or perceived ability) to meet our financial obligations without experiencing significant business disruption or reputational damage that may threaten our viability as a going concern. For a further discussion about our liquidity risk, see &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk&#8212;Liquidity Risk&#8221; in the 2020 Form 10-K and &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8221; herein. In addition, for further information on market and economic conditions and their effects on risk in general, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in the 2020 Form 10-K. 

Legal and Compliance Risk 

Legal and compliance risk includes the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss, including fines, penalties, judgments, damages and/or settlements, or loss to reputation that we may suffer as a result of failure to comply 

with laws, regulations, rules, related self-regulatory organization standards and codes of conduct applicable to our business activities. This risk also includes contractual and commercial risk, such as the risk that a counterparty&#8217;s performance obligations will be unenforceable. It also includes compliance with AML, terrorist financing, and anti-corruption rules and regulations. For a further discussion about our legal and compliance risk, see &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk&#8212;Legal and Compliance Risk&#8221; in the 2020 Form 10-K.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Morgan Stanley: 

Results of Review of Interim Financial Information 

We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet of Morgan Stanley and subsidiaries (the &#8220;Firm&#8221;) as of March 31, 2021, and the related condensed consolidated income statements, comprehensive income statements, cash flow statements and statements of changes in total equity for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &#8220;interim financial information&#8221;). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial information for it to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Firm as of December 31, 2020, and the related consolidated income statement, comprehensive income statement, cash flow statement and statement of changes in total equity for the year then ended (not presented herein) included in the Firm&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K; and in our report dated February 26, 2021, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived. 

Basis for Review Results 

This interim financial information is the responsibility of the Firm&#8217;s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Firm in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our reviews in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

1. Introduction and Basis of Presentation 

The Firm 

Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm that maintains significant market positions in each of its business segments&#8212;Institutional Securities, Wealth Management and Investment Management. Morgan Stanley, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, provides a wide variety of products and services to a large and diversified group of clients and customers, including corporations, governments, financial institutions and individuals. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms &#8220;Morgan Stanley&#8221; or the &#8220;Firm&#8221; mean Morgan Stanley (the &#8220;Parent Company&#8221;) together with its consolidated subsidiaries. See the &#8220;Glossary of Common Terms and Acronyms&#8221; for the definition of certain terms and acronyms used throughout this Form 10-Q. 

A description of the clients and principal products and services of each of the Firm&#8217;s business segments is as follows: 

Institutional Securities provides a variety of products and services to corporations, governments, financial institutions and high to ultra-high net worth clients. Investment banking services consist of capital raising and financial advisory services, including services relating to the underwriting of debt, equity and other securities, as well as advice on mergers and acquisitions, restructurings, real estate and project finance. Our Equity and Fixed Income businesses include sales, financing, prime brokerage, market-making, Asia wealth management services and certain business-related investments. Lending activities include originating corporate loans and commercial real estate loans, providing secured lending facilities, and extending securities-based and other financing to customers. Other activities include research.

Institutional clients include defined benefit/defined contribution plans, foundations,

Basis of Financial Information 

The financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires the Firm to make estimates and assumptions regarding the valuations of certain financial instruments, the valuations of goodwill and intangible assets, the outcome of legal and tax matters, deferred tax assets, ACL, and other matters that affect its financial statements and related disclosures. The Firm believes that the estimates utilized in the preparation of its financial statements are prudent and reasonable. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. 

The financial statements reflect the effects of the following reclassifications to prior period amounts. The Provision for credit losses for loans and lending commitments is now presented as a separate line in the income statements. Previously, the provision for credit losses for loans was included in Other revenues, and the provision for credit losses for lending commitments was included in Other expenses. In addition, economic hedges of certain held-for-sale and held-for-investment loans, which were previously reported in Trading revenues, are now reported in Other revenues. 

The Notes are an integral part of the Firm's financial statements. The Firm has evaluated subsequent events for adjustment to or disclosure in these financial statements through the date of this report and has not identified any recordable or disclosable events not otherwise reported in these financial statements or the notes thereto. 

The accompanying financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Firm&#8217;s financial statements and notes thereto included in the 2020 Form 10-K. Certain footnote disclosures included in the 2020 Form 10-K have been condensed or omitted from these financial statements as they are not required for interim reporting under U.S. GAAP. The financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal, recurring nature that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for the fair presentation of the results for the interim period. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire year. 

Consolidation 

The financial statements include the accounts of the Firm, its wholly owned subsidiaries and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest, including certain VIEs (see Note 15). Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. For consolidated subsidiaries that are not wholly owned, the third-party holdings of equity interests are referred to as Noncontrolling interests. The net income attributable to Noncontrolling interests for such subsidiaries is 

March 2021 Form 10-Q 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

presented as Net income applicable to noncontrolling interests in the income statements. The portion of shareholders&#8217; equity that is attributable to noncontrolling interests for such subsidiaries is presented as noncontrolling interests, a component of Total equity, in the balance sheets. 

For a discussion of the Firm&#8217;s significant regulated U.S. and international subsidiaries and its involvement with VIEs, see Note 1 to the financial statements in the 2020 Form 10-K. 

2. Significant Accounting Policies 

For a detailed discussion about the Firm&#8217;s significant accounting policies and for further information on accounting updates adopted in the prior year, see Note 2 to the financial statements in the 2020 Form 10-K. 

During the three months ended March 31, 2021 (&#8220;current quarter&#8221;), there were no significant updates to the Firm&#8217;s significant accounting policies, other than as described below and in Note 1 to the financial statements. 

The Firm&#8217;s acquisition of Eaton Vance Corp. (&#8220;Eaton Vance&#8221;) on March 1, 2021 added indefinite lived intangible assets to the Firm&#8217;s balance sheet. Indefinite lived intangibles are not amortized but are tested for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist. For both the annual and interim tests, the Firm has the option to either (i) perform a quantitative impairment test or (ii) first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired, in which case if it is the quantitative test would be performed . 

3 . Acquisitions 

Acquisition of Eaton Vance 

On March 1, 2021, the Firm completed the acquisition of 100 % of Eaton Vance in a stock and cash transaction, which increases the scale and breadth of the Investment Management business segment. Total consideration for the transaction was approximately $ 8.7 billion, which consists of the $ 5.3 billion fair value of 69 million common shares issued from Common stock held in treasury and cash of approximately $ 3.4 billion. 

Upon acquisition, the assets and liabilities of Eaton Vance were adjusted to their respective fair values as of the closing date of the transaction, including the identifiable intangible assets acquired. In addition, the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired has been recorded as goodwill. The fair value estimates used in valuing certain acquired assets and liabilities are based, in part, on inputs that are unobservable. For intangible assets, these include, but are not limited to forecasted future cash flows, revenue growth rates, attrition rates and discount rates.

The proforma information does not reflect the potential benefits of cost and funding synergies, opportunities to earn additional revenues, or other factors, and therefore does not represent what the actual Net revenues and Net income would have been had the companies actually been combined as of this date.

1. Net transfers in the prior year quarter included the transfer of $ 857 million of equity margin loans from Level 2 to Level 3 as the significance of the margin loan rate input increased as a result of reduced liquidity. 

2. Net transfers in the current quarter reflect the transfer of certain AFS securities from Level 3 to Level 2 due to increased trading activity and observability of pricing inputs. 

Level 3 instruments may be hedged with instruments classified in Level 1 and Level 2. The realized and unrealized gains or losses for assets and liabilities within the Level 3 category presented in the previous tables do not reflect the related realized and unrealized gains or losses on hedging instruments that have been classified by the Firm within the Level 1 and/or Level 2 categories. 

The unrealized gains (losses) during the period for assets and liabilities within the Level 3 category may include changes in fair value during the period that were attributable to both observable and unobservable inputs.

1. A single amount is disclosed for range and average when there is no significant difference between the minimum, maximum and average. Amounts represent weighted averages except where simple averages and the median of the inputs are more relevant. 

2. Includes derivative contracts with multiple risks (i.e., hybrid products). 

The previous tables provide information on the valuation techniques, significant unobservable inputs, and the ranges and averages for each major category of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis with a significant Level 3 balance. The level of aggregation and breadth of products cause the range of inputs to be wide and not evenly distributed across the inventory of financial instruments. Further, the range of unobservable inputs may 

differ across firms in the financial services industry because of diversity in the types of products included in each firm&#8217;s inventory. Generally, there are no predictable relationships between multiple significant unobservable inputs attributable to a given valuation technique. 

For a description of the Firm&#8217;s significant unobservable inputs and qualitative information about the effect of hypothetical changes in the values of those inputs, see Note 5 to the financial statements in the 2020 Form 10-K. During the current quarter, there were no significant revisions made to the descriptions of the Firm&#8217;s significant unobservable inputs.

1. Investments in hedge funds may be subject to initial period lock-up or gate provisions, which restrict an investor from withdrawing from the fund during a certain initial period or restrict the redemption amount on any redemption date, respectively. 

Amounts in the previous table represent the Firm&#8217;s carrying value of general and limited partnership interests in fund investments, as well as any related performance-based fees in the form of carried interest. The carrying amounts are measured based on the NAV of the fund taking into account the distribution terms applicable to the interest held. This same measurement applies whether the fund investments are accounted for under the equity method or fair value. 

For a description of the Firm&#8217;s investments in private equity funds, real estate funds and hedge funds, which are measured based on NAV, see Note 5 to the financial statements in the 2020 Form 10-K. 

See Note 14 for information regarding general partner guarantees, which include potential obligations to return performance fee distributions previously received. See Note 20 for information regarding unrealized carried interest at risk of reversal.

1. Gains and losses for Loans and Other assets&#8212;Other investments are classified in Other revenues. For other items, gains and losses are recorded in Other revenues if the item is held for sale; otherwise, they are recorded in Other expenses. 

2. Nonrecurring changes in the fair value of loans and lending commitments were calculated as follows: for the held-for-investment category, based on the value of the underlying collateral; and for the held-for-sale category, based on recently executed transactions, market price quotations, valuation models that incorporate market observable inputs where possible, such as comparable loan or debt prices and CDS spread levels adjusted for any basis difference between cash and derivative instruments, or default recovery analysis where such transactions and quotations are unobservable. 

3. Losses related to Other assets&#8212;Other investments were determined using techniques that included discounted cash flow models, methodologies that incorporate multiples of certain comparable companies and recently executed transactions. 

4. Losses related to Other assets&#8212;Premises, equipment and software generally include impairments as well as write-offs related to the disposal of certain assets.

6. Fair Value Option 

The Firm has elected the fair value option for certain eligible instruments that are risk managed on a fair value basis to mitigate income statement volatility caused by measurement basis differences between the elected instruments and their associated risk management transactions or to eliminate complexities of applying certain accounting models.

1. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. 

The notional amounts of derivative contracts generally overstate the Firm&#8217;s exposure. In most circumstances, notional amounts are used only as a reference point from which to calculate amounts owed between the parties to the 

contract. Furthermore, notional amounts do not reflect the benefit of legally enforceable netting arrangements or risk mitigating transactions. 

For a discussion of the Firm&#8217;s derivative instruments and hedging activities, see Note 7 to the financial statements in the 2020 Form 10-K.

For AFS securities, the Firm believes there are no securities in an unrealized loss position that have credit losses after performing the analysis described in Note 2 in the 2020 Form 10-K. Additionally, the Firm does not intend to sell the securities and is not likely to be required to sell the securities prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis. Furthermore, the securities have not experienced credit losses as they are predominantly investment grade and the Firm expects to recover the amortized cost basis. 

The HTM securities net carrying amounts at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 reflect ACL of $ 24 million and $ 26 million, respectively, related to Non-agency CMBS. See Note 2 in the 2020 Form 10-K for a description of the ACL methodology used beginning in 2020 following the Firm&#8217;s adoption of CECL. As of March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, Non-Agency CMBS HTM securities were predominantly on accrual status and investment grade. 

See Note 15 for additional information on securities issued by VIEs, including U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, non-agency CMBS, FFELP student loan ABS and other ABS.

The aggregate allowance for loans and lending commitments decreased in the current quarter, primarily reflecting a release in the allowance for credit losses within the Institutional Securities business segment. The allowance release was primarily a result of improvements in the outlook for macroeconomic conditions and the impact of paydowns on Corporate loans, including by lower-rated borrowers.The base scenario used in our ACL models as of March 31, 2021 was generated using a combination of industry consensus economic forecasts, forward rates, and internally developed and validated models. Given the nature of our lending portfolio, the most sensitive model input is U.S. gross domestic product. The base scenario, among other things, assumes a continued recovery over the forecast period with U.S. GDP reaching pre-COVID-19 levels by the third quarter of 2021, supported by fiscal stimulus and accommodative monetary policy. For a further discussion of the Firm&#8217;s loans as well as the Firm&#8217;s allowance methodology, refer to Notes 2 and 10 to the financial statements in the 2020 Form 10-K.

These liabilities are generally payable from the cash flows of the related assets accounted for as Trading assets. See Note 15 for further information on other secured financings related to VIEs and securitization activities. 

For transfers of assets that fail to meet accounting criteria for a sale, the Firm continues to record the assets and recognizes the associated liabilities in the balance sheets.

March 2021 Form 10-Q 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

The Firm has obligations under certain guarantee arrangements, including contracts and indemnification agreements, that contingently require the Firm to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying measure (such as an interest or foreign exchange rate, security or commodity price, an index, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of a specified event) related to an asset, liability or equity security of a guaranteed party. Also included as guarantees are contracts that contingently require the Firm to make payments to the guaranteed party based on another entity&#8217;s failure to perform under an agreement, as well as indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others. 

For more information on the nature of the obligations and related business activities for our guarantees, see Note 15 to the financial statements in the 2020 Form 10-K. 

Other Guarantees and Indemnities 

In the normal course of business, the Firm provides guarantees and indemnifications in a variety of transactions. These provisions generally are standard contractual terms. Certain of these guarantees and indemnifications related to indemnities, exchange and clearinghouse member guarantees and merger and acquisition guarantees are described in Note 15 to the financial statements in the 2020 Form 10-K. 

In addition, in the ordinary course of business, the Firm guarantees the debt and/or certain trading obligations (including obligations associated with derivatives, foreign exchange contracts and the settlement of physical commodities) of certain subsidiaries. These guarantees generally are entity or product specific and are required by investors or trading counterparties. The activities of the Firm&#8217;s subsidiaries covered by these guarantees (including any related debt or trading obligations) are included in the financial statements. 

Finance Subsidiary 

The Parent Company fully and unconditionally guarantees the securities issued by Morgan Stanley Finance LLC, a wholly owned finance subsidiary. No other subsidiary of the Parent Company guarantees these securities. 

Contingencies 

Legal 

In addition to the matters described in the following paragraphs, in the normal course of business, the Firm has been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with its activities as a global diversified financial services institution. Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. In some cases, the entities that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases 

are bankrupt or are in financial distress. These actions have included, but are not limited to, residential mortgage and credit crisis-related matters. 

While the Firm has identified below any individual proceedings where the Firm believes a material loss to be reasonably possible and reasonably estimable, there can be no assurance that material losses will not be incurred from claims that have not yet been asserted or those where potential losses have not yet been determined to be probable or possible, and reasonably estimable. 

The Firm contests liability and/or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter. Where available information indicates that it is probable a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the Firm can reasonably estimate the amount of that loss, the Firm accrues the estimated loss by a charge to income. 

In many proceedings and investigations, however, it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible or to estimate the amount of any loss. In addition, even where a loss is possible or an exposure to loss exists in excess of the liability already accrued with respect to a previously recognized loss contingency, it is not always possible to reasonably estimate the size of the possible loss or range of loss, particularly for proceedings and investigations where the factual record is being developed or contested or where plaintiffs or government entities seek substantial or indeterminate damages, restitution, disgorgement or penalties. Numerous issues may need to be resolved before a loss or additional loss, or range of loss or additional range of loss, can be reasonably estimated for a proceeding or investigation, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters, determination of issues related to class certification and the calculation of damages or other relief, and by addressing novel or unsettled legal questions relevant to the proceedings or investigations in question. 

For certain other legal proceedings and investigations, the Firm can estimate reasonably possible losses, additional losses, ranges of loss or ranges of additional loss in excess of amounts accrued but does not believe, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that such losses could have a material adverse effect on the Firm&#8217;s financial statements as a whole, other than the matters referred to in the following paragraphs. 

On September 23, 2014, Financial Guaranty Insurance Company (&#8220;FGIC&#8221;) filed a complaint against the Firm in the Supreme Court of the State of New York County (&#8220;Supreme Court of NY&#8221;) styled Financial Guaranty Insurance Company v. Morgan Stanley ABS Capital I Inc. et al . relating to the Morgan Stanley ABS Capital I Inc. Trust 2007-NC4. The complaint asserts claims for breach of contract and fraudulent inducement and alleges, among other things, that the loans in the trust breached various representations and 

March 2021 Form 10-Q 56 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

warranties and defendants made untrue statements and material omissions to induce FGIC to issue a financial guaranty policy on certain classes of certificates that had an original balance of approximately $ 876 million. The complaint seeks, among other relief, specific performance of the loan breach remedy procedures in the transaction documents, compensatory, consequential and punitive damages, attorneys&#8217; fees, interest and costs. On January 23, 2017, the court denied the Firm&#8217;s motion to dismiss the complaint. On September 13, 2018, the Appellate Division, First Department (&#8220;First Department&#8221;) affirmed in part and reversed in part the lower court&#8217;s order denying the Firm&#8217;s motion to dismiss the complaint. On December 20, 2018, the First Department denied plaintiff&#8217;s motion for leave to appeal to the New York Court of Appeals (&#8220;Court of Appeals&#8221;) or, in the alternative, for re-argument. Based on currently available information, the Firm believes that it could incur a loss in this action of up to approximately $ 277 million, the total original unpaid balance of the mortgage loans for which the Firm received repurchase demands from a certificate holder and FGIC that the Firm did not repurchase, plus pre- and post- judgment interest, fees and costs, as well as claim payments that FGIC has made and will make in the future. In addition, plaintiff is seeking to expand the number of loans at issue and the possible range of loss could increase. 

On January 23, 2015, Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, in its capacity as trustee, filed a complaint against the Firm styled Deutsche Bank National Trust Company solely in its capacity as Trustee of the Morgan Stanley ABS Capital I Inc. Trust 2007-NC4 v. Morgan Stanley Mortgage Capital Holdings LLC as Successor-by-Merger to Morgan Stanley Mortgage Capital Inc., and Morgan Stanley ABS Capital I Inc. , pending in the Supreme Court of NY. The complaint asserts claims for breach of contract and alleges, among other things, that the loans in the trust, which had an original principal balance of approximately $ 1.05 billion, breached various representations and warranties. The complaint seeks, among other relief, specific performance of the loan breach remedy procedures in the transaction documents, compensatory, consequential, rescissory, equitable and punitive damages, attorneys&#8217; fees, costs and other related expenses, and interest. On December 11, 2015, the court granted in part and denied in part the Firm&#8217;s motion to dismiss the complaint. On October 19, 2018, the court granted the Firm&#8217;s motion for leave to amend its answer and to stay the case pending resolution of Deutsche Bank National Trust Company&#8217;s appeal to the Court of Appeals in another case, styled Deutsche Bank National Trust Company v. Barclays Bank PLC , regarding the applicable statute of limitations. On January 17, 2019, the First Department reversed the trial court&#8217;s order to the extent that it had granted in part the Firm&#8217;s motion to dismiss the complaint. On June 4, 2019, the First Department granted the Firm&#8217;s motion for leave to appeal its January 17, 2019 decision to the Court of Appeals. On March 19, 2020, the Firm filed a motion for partial summary judgment. Based on currently available information, the Firm believes that it could incur a loss in this 

action of up to approximately $ 277 million, the total original unpaid balance of the mortgage loans for which the Firm received repurchase demands from a certificate holder and a monoline insurer that the Firm did not repurchase, plus pre- and post-judgment interest, fees and costs, but plaintiff is seeking to expand the number of loans at issue and the possible range of loss could increase. 

Tax 

In matters styled Case number 15/3637 and Case number 15/4353 , the Dutch Tax Authority (&#8220;Dutch Authority&#8221;) is challenging in the Dutch courts, the prior set-off by the Firm of approximately &#8364; 124 million (approximately $ 145 million) plus accrued interest of withholding tax credits against the Firm&#8217;s corporation tax liabilities for the tax years 2007 to 2013. The Dutch Authority alleges that the Firm was not entitled to receive the withholding tax credits on the basis, inter alia, that a Firm subsidiary did not hold legal title to certain securities subject to withholding tax on the relevant dates. The Dutch Authority has also alleged that the Firm failed to provide certain information to the Dutch Authority and keep adequate books and records. On April 26, 2018, the District Court in Amsterdam issued a decision dismissing the Dutch Authority&#8217;s claims with respect to certain of the tax years in dispute. On May 12, 2020, the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam granted the Dutch Authority&#8217;s appeal in matters re-styled Case number 18/00318 and Case number 18/00319 . On June 22, 2020, the Firm filed an appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam before the Dutch High Court. On January 29, 2021, the Advocate General of the Dutch High Court in matters re-styled Case number 15/3637 and Case number 15/4353 issued an advisory opinion on the Firm&#8217;s appeal, which rejected the Firm&#8217;s principal grounds of appeal. On February 11, 2021, the Firm and the Dutch Tax Authority each responded to this opinion.

Consolidated VIE assets and liabilities are presented in the previous tables after intercompany eliminations. Generally, most assets owned by consolidated VIEs cannot be removed unilaterally by the Firm and are not available to the Firm while the related liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are non-recourse to the Firm. However, in certain consolidated VIEs, the Firm either has the unilateral right to remove assets or provides additional recourse through derivatives such as total return swaps, guarantees or other forms of involvement. 

In general, the Firm&#8217;s exposure to loss in consolidated VIEs is limited to losses that would be absorbed on the VIE net assets recognized in its financial statements, net of amounts absorbed by third-party variable interest holders.

1. Amounts include transactions backed by residential mortgage loans, commercial mortgage loans and other types of assets, including consumer or commercial assets, and may be in loan or security form. 

2. Other primarily includes exposures to commercial real estate property and investment funds. 

3. Where notional amounts are utilized in quantifying the maximum exposure related to derivatives, such amounts do not reflect changes in fair value recorded by the Firm. 

4. Additional VIE assets owned represents the carrying value of total exposure to non-consolidated VIEs for which the maximum exposure to loss is less than specific thresholds, primarily interests issued by securitization SPEs. The Firm&#8217;s maximum exposure to loss generally equals the fair value of the assets owned. These assets are primarily included in Trading assets and Investment securities and are measured at fair value (see Note 5). The Firm does not provide additional support in these transactions through contractual facilities, guarantees or similar derivatives. 

The majority of the VIEs included in the previous tables are sponsored by unrelated parties; examples of the Firm&#8217;s involvement with these VIEs include its secondary market-making activities and the securities held in its Investment securities portfolio (see Note 8). 

The Firm&#8217;s maximum exposure to loss is dependent on the nature of the Firm&#8217;s variable interest in the VIE and is limited to the notional amounts of certain liquidity facilities and other credit support, total return swaps and written put options, as well as the fair value of certain other derivatives and investments the Firm has made in the VIE. 

The Firm&#8217;s maximum exposure to loss in the previous tables does not include the offsetting benefit of hedges or any reductions associated with the amount of collateral held as part of a transaction with the VIE or any party to the VIE directly against a specific exposure to loss. 

Liabilities issued by VIEs generally are non-recourse to the Firm.

2. Amounts include assets transferred by unrelated transferors. 

The previous tables include transactions with SPEs in which the Firm, acting as principal, transferred financial assets with continuing involvement and received sales treatment. The transferred assets are carried at fair value prior to securitization, and any changes in fair value are recognized in the income statements. The Firm may act as underwriter of the beneficial interests issued by these securitization vehicles, for which Investment banking revenues are recognized. The Firm may retain interests in the securitized financial assets as one or more tranches of the securitization. These retained interests are generally carried at fair value in the balance sheets with changes in fair value recognized in the income statements. Fair value for these interests is measured using techniques that are consistent with the valuation techniques applied to the Firm&#8217;s major categories of assets and liabilities as described in Note 2 in the 2020 Form 10-K and Note 5 herein. Further, as permitted by applicable guidance, certain transfers of assets where the Firm&#8217;s only continuing involvement is a derivative are only reported in the following Assets Sold with Retained Exposure table.

16. Regulatory Requirements 

Regulatory Capital Framework and Requirements 

For a discussion of the Firm&#8217;s regulatory capital framework, see Note 17 to the financial statements in the 2020 Form 10-K. 

The Firm is required to maintain minimum risk-based and leverage-based capital ratios under regulatory capital requirements. A summary of the calculations of regulatory capital and RWA follows. 

Minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements apply to Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital (which includes Tier 2 capital). Capital standards require certain adjustments to, and deductions from, capital for purposes of determining these ratios. At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the difference between the actual and required ratio was lower under the Standardized Approach. 

In 2020, the U.S. banking agencies adopted a final rule, consistent with an interim final rule that was effective March 31, 2020, altering, for purposes of the regulatory capital rules, the required adoption time period for CECL. As of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the risk-based and leverage-based capital amounts and ratios, as well as RWA, adjusted average assets and supplementary leverage exposure are calculated excluding the effect of the adoption of CECL based on the Firm&#8217;s election to defer this effect over a five-year transition period in accordance with the final rule.

1. The CCyB can be set up to 2.5 %, but is currently set by the U.S. banking agencies at zero . 

2. The capital buffer requirement represents the amount of Common Equity Tier 1 capital the Firm must maintain above the minimum risk-based capital requirements in order to avoid restrictions on the Firm's ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. The Firm's Standardized Approach capital buffer requirement is equal to the sum of the SCB, G-SIB capital surcharge and CCyB, and the Advanced Approach capital buffer requirement is equal to the 2.5 % capital conservation buffer, G-SIB capital surcharge and CCyB. 

3. Required ratios represent the regulatory minimum plus the capital buffer requirement.

1. Required ratios are inclusive of any buffers applicable as of the date presented. Failure to maintain the buffers would result in restrictions on the Firm&#8217;s ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. 

2. Adjusted average assets represents the denominator of the Tier 1 leverage ratio and is composed of the average daily balance of consolidated on-balance sheet assets for the quarters ending on the respective balance sheet dates, reduced by disallowed goodwill, intangible assets, investments in covered funds, defined benefit pension plan assets, after-tax gain on sale from assets sold into securitizations, investments in the Firm&#8217;s own capital instruments, certain defined tax assets and other capital deductions. 

3. Supplementary leverage exposure is the sum of Adjusted average assets used in the Tier 1 leverage ratio and other adjustments, primarily: (i) for derivatives, potential future exposure and the effective notional principal amount of sold credit protection offset by qualifying purchased credit protection; (ii) the counterparty credit risk for repo-style transactions; and (iii) the credit equivalent amount for off-balance sheet exposures. 

4. Based on a Federal Reserve interim final rule that was in effect until March 31, 2021, the Firm&#8217;s SLR and Supplementary leverage exposure as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 reflect the exclusion of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks. 

Certain U.S. Bank Subsidiaries&#8217; Regulatory Capital and Capital Ratios 

The OCC establishes capital requirements for the Firm&#8217;s U.S. bank subsidiaries, which as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 include, among others, Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A. (&#8220;MSBNA&#8221;) and Morgan Stanley Private Bank, National Association (&#8220;MSPBNA&#8221;), and evaluates their compliance with such capital requirements. Regulatory capital requirements for MSBNA and MSPBNA are calculated in a similar manner to the Firm&#8217;s regulatory capital requirements, although G-SIB capital surcharge and SCB requirements do not apply to the U.S. bank subsidiaries. 

The OCC&#8217;s regulatory capital framework includes Prompt Corrective Action (&#8220;PCA&#8221;) standards, including &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; PCA standards that are based on specified regulatory capital ratio minimums. For the Firm to remain an FHC, its U.S. bank subsidiaries must remain well-capitalized in accordance with the OCC&#8217;s PCA standards. In addition, failure by the U.S. bank subsidiaries to meet minimum capital requirements may result in certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the U.S. bank subsidiaries&#8217; and the Firm&#8217;s financial statements. 

At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, MSBNA and MSPBNA risk-based capital ratios are based on the 

Standardized Approach rules. At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the risk-based and leverage-based capital amounts and ratios are calculated excluding the effect of the adoption of CECL based on MSBNA&#8217;s and MSPBNA&#8217;s election to defer this effect over a five-year transition period.

19. Income Taxes 

The Firm is under continuous examination by the IRS and other tax authorities in certain countries, such as Japan and the U.K., and in states and localities in which it has significant business operations, such as New York. 

The Firm believes that the resolution of these tax examinations will not have a material effect on the annual financial statements, although a resolution could have a material impact in the income statement and on the effective tax rate for any period in which such resolutions occur. 

It is reasonably possible that significant changes in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits may occur within the next 12 months. At this time, however, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the expected change to the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits and the impact on the Firm&#8217;s effective tax rate over the next 12 months.
