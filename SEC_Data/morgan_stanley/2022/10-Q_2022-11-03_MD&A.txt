Executive Summary 

Overview of Financial Results 

Consolidated Results&#8212;Three Months Ended September 30, 2022 

&#8226; The Firm reported net revenues of $13.0 billion, against a volatile market backdrop. 

&#8226; The Firm delivered ROTCE of 14.6%, or 15.2% excluding the impact of integration-related expenses (see &#8220;Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information&#8221; herein). 

&#8226; The Firm&#8217;s expense efficiency ratio of 74% in the current quarter, or 73% excluding the impact of integration-related expenses (see &#8220;Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information&#8221; herein), contributed to an expense efficiency ratio in the current year period of 72%, or 71% excluding the impact of integration-related expenses (see &#8220;Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information&#8221; herein). 

&#8226; At September 30, 2022 our Standardized Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 14.8%. 

&#8226; Institutional Securities net revenues of $5.8 billion reflect strong performance in Fixed Income and solid results in Equity, while the uncertain macroeconomic environment continued to drive limited activity in Investment Banking. 

&#8226; Wealth Management delivered a pre-tax margin of 26.9%, or 28.4% excluding integration-related expenses (see &#8220;Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information&#8221; herein). Results reflect higher net interest income driven by higher interest rates. The business added $65 billion in net new assets, bringing total net new assets year-to-date to $260 billion. 

&#8226; Investment Management delivered net revenues of $1.2 billion on AUM of $1.3 trillion in a challenging market environment.

Non-interest Expenses 1 

($ in millions) 

1. The percentages on the bars in the chart represent the contribution of compensation and benefits expenses and non-compensation expenses to the total. 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses of $5,614 million in the current quarter decreased 5% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower discretionary incentive compensation and a decrease due to the formulaic payout to Wealth Management representatives driven by lower compensable revenues, partially offset by higher salary expenses driven in part by the impact of higher headcount. Compensati on and benefits expenses of $17,438 million in the current year period decreased 9% from the prior year period, primarily due to lower expenses related to certain deferred compensation plans linked to investment performance and lower stock-based compensation expense driven by the Firm&#8217;s share price, and lower discretionary incentive compensation, partially offset by higher salary expenses driven in part by the impact of higher headcount. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expenses of $3,949 million in the current quarter were relatively unchanged from the prior year quarter . Non-compensation expenses of $11,993 million in the current year period increased 6% from the prior year period, primarily due to higher legal expenses, including $200 million related to a regulatory matter in the second quarter of 2022 and increased spend on technology. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $35 million in the current quarter was primarily driven by deterioration in macroeconomic outlook. The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments in the prior year quarter was $24 million, primarily driven by growth in corporate lending commitments. 

The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $193 million in the current year period was due to portfolio growth and deterioration in macroeconomic outlook. The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments in the prior year period was flat, primarily as a result of paydowns on corporate loans, including by lower-rated borrowers, offset by the provision for one secured lending facility in the second quarter of 2021. 

For further information on the Provision for credit losses, see &#8220;Credit Risk&#8221; herein. 

Income Taxes 

The effective tax rate of 21.4% for the current quarter and 21.1% for the current year period was lower than the prior respective periods, primarily driven by the realization of certain tax benefits.

Net revenues of $17,791 million in the current year period were relatively unchanged from the prior year period, as lower Transactional revenues, primarily driven by losses on investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans, were offset by higher Net interest revenues and Asset management revenues.

Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information 

We prepare our financial statements using U.S. GAAP. From time to time, we may disclose certain &#8220;non-GAAP financial measures&#8221; in this document or in the course of our earnings releases, earnings and other conference calls, financial presentations, definitive proxy statement and otherwise. A &#8220;non-GAAP financial measure&#8221; excludes, or includes, amounts from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We consider the non-GAAP financial measures we disclose to be useful to us, investors, analysts and other stakeholders by providing further transparency about, or an alternate means of assessing or comparing our financial condition, operating results and capital adequacy. 

These measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, U.S. GAAP and may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Whenever we refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, we will also generally define it or present the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, along with a reconciliation of the differences between the U.S. GAAP financial measure and the non-GAAP financial measure.

1. Adjusted amounts exclude the effect of costs related to the integrations of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance, net of tax as appropriate. 

2. ROE and ROTCE represent earnings applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders as a percentage of average common equity and average tangible common equity, respectively. When excluding integration-related costs, both the numerator and average denominator are adjusted. 

3. Average common equity and average tangible common equity for each business segment is determined using our Required Capital framework (see "Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Regulatory Requirements&#8212;Attribution of Average Common Equity According to the Required Capital Framework&#8221; herein). The sums of the segments&#8217; Average common equity and Average tangible common equity do not equal the Consolidated measures due to Parent equity. 

4. The calculation of ROE and ROTCE by segment uses net income applicable to Morgan Stanley by segment less preferred dividends allocated to each segment as a percentage of average common equity and average tangible common equity, respectively, allocated to each segment. 

Return on Tangible Common Equity Goal 

In January 2022, we established an ROTCE goal of over 20%, excluding integration-related expenses. Our ROTCE goal is a forward-looking statement that was based on a normal market environment and may be materially affected by many factors. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; and &#8220;Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; in the 2021 Form 10-K for further information on market and economic conditions and their potential effects on our future operating results.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Business Segments 

Substantially all of our operating revenues and operating expenses are directly attributable to our business segments. Certain revenues and expenses have been allocated to each business segment, generally in proportion to its respective net revenues, non-interest expenses or other relevant measures. See Note 19 to the financial statements for segment net revenues by income statement line item and information on intersegment transactions. 

The global economic and geopolitical environment continues to be characterized by persistent inflation, rising interest rates and volatility in global financial markets. This environment has impacted our businesses, as discussed further herein. 

For an overview of the components of our business segments, net revenues, compensation expense and income taxes, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Business Segments&#8221; in the 2021 Form 10-K.

Current Quarter 

Equity 

Net revenues of $2,459 million in the current quarter decreased 14% compared with elevated levels in the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting a decrease in execution services. 

&#8226; Financing revenues decreased primarily due to lower average client balances and lower client activity. 

&#8226; Execution services revenues decreased primarily due to a mark-to-market loss on a business-related investment and lower client activity in derivatives and cash equities. 

Fixed Income 

Net revenues of $2,181 million in the current quarter increased 33% compared with the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting an increase in global macro products. 

&#8226; Global macro products benefited from client engagement and increased client flow activity in an environment characterized by inflationary pressures, central bank actions and fiscal activity driving higher volatility. Revenues increased primarily due to the impact of market conditions 

on inventory held to facilitate client activity and increased client activity. 

&#8226; Credit products revenues were relatively unchanged from the prior year quarter as an increase due to the impact of market conditions on inventory held to facilitate client activity in corporate credit products was offset by a decrease in client activity in corporate credit products. 

&#8226; Commodities products and other fixed income revenues decreased primarily due to lower client activity in Commodities. 

Other Net Revenues 

Other Net revenues in the current quarter decreased compared with the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher mark-to-market losses on corporate loans held for sale, net of hedges compared with gains in the prior year quarter . 

Current Year Period 

Equity 

Net revenues of $8,593 million in the current year period were relatively unchanged compared with the prior year period as an increase in financing was offset by a decrease in execution services . 

&#8226; Absent the loss from a credit event for a single client in the prior year period, Financing revenues decreased as the impact of marginally lower average client balances was partially offset by the impact of a change in client balance mix. 

&#8226; Execution services revenues decreased primarily due to lower client activity and the impact of market conditions on inventory held to facilitate client activity in cash equities, as well as a mark-to-market loss on a business-related investment, partially offset by the absence of trading losses related to the aforementioned credit event. 

Fixed Income 

Net revenues of $7,604 million in the current year period increased 21% compared with the prior year period, primarily reflecting an increase in global macro and commodities products, partially offset by a decrease in credit products. 

&#8226; Global macro products benefited from client engagement and increased client flow activity in an environment characterized by inflationary pressures, central bank actions and fiscal activity driving higher volatility. Revenues increased primarily due to the impact of market conditions on inventory held to facilitate client activity and increased client activity. 

&#8226; Credit products revenues decreased primarily due to the impact of market conditions on inventory held to facilitate client activity across products. 

&#8226; Commodities products and other fixed income revenues increased primarily due to higher client activity and the impact of market conditions on inventory held to facilitate client activity in Commodities. 

September 2022 Form 10-Q 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Other Net Revenues 

Other Net revenues in the current year period decreased compared with the prior year period, primarily due to higher mark-to-market losses on corporate loans held for sale, net of hedges, as well as losses compared with gains in the prior year period on investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans and lower results from our Japanese joint venture, MUMSS . 

Provision for Credit Losses 

Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $24 million in the current quarter was primarily driven by deterioration in macroeconomic outlook. The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments was $24 million in the prior year quarter, primarily driven by growth in corporate lending commitments. 

Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $150 million in the current year period was driven by portfolio growth and deterioration in macroeconomic outlook. In the prior year period, the Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments was flat, primarily as a result of provision for one secured lending facility in the second quarter of 2021, offset by the impact of paydowns on corporate loans, including by lower-rated borrowers. 

For further information on the Provision for credit losses, see &#8220;Credit Risk&#8221; herein. 

Non-interest Expenses 

Non-interest expenses of $4,167 million in the current quarter decreased 7% compared with the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower Compensation and benefits expenses. 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses decreased in the current quarter, primarily due to lower discretionary incentive compensation on lower revenues. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expenses were relatively unchanged in the current quarter. 

Non-interest expenses of $13,476 million in the current year period decreased 6% compared with the prior year period, primarily due to lower Compensation and benefits expenses, partially offset by higher Non-compensation expenses. 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses decreased in the current year period, primarily due to lower discretionary incentive compensation on lower revenues, lower stock-based compensation expense driven by the Firm&#8217;s share price, and lower expenses related to certain deferred compensation plans linked to investment performance, partially offset by higher salary expenses driven in part by the impact of higher headcount. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expenses increased in the current year period, primarily due to an increase in legal expenses, including $200 million related to a regulatory matter in the second quarter of 2022 and increased spend on technology. 

Income Taxes 

The effective tax rate of 18.8% for the current quarter and 20.7% for the current year period was lower than the prior respective periods, primarily driven by the realization of certain tax benefits.

Acquisition of Eaton Vance 

The comparison of the current year period results to the prior year period is impacted by the acquisition of Eaton Vance on March 1, 2021. For additional information on the acquisition of Eaton Vance, see Note 3 to the financial statements in the 2021 Form 10-K. 

Net Revenues 

Asset Management and Related Fees 

Asset management and related fees of $1,269 million in the current quarter decreased 14% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower average AUM driven by the decline in equity markets, partially offset by the impact of lower fee waivers in certain money market funds. 

Asset management and related fees of $3,961 million in the current year period were relatively unchanged from the prior year period, reflecting the impact of the decline in equity markets, offset by incremental revenues as a result of the Eaton Vance acquisition and the impact of lower fee waivers in certain money market funds. 

Asset management revenues are influenced by the level and relative mix of AUM. The current market environment may impact AUM and net flows within asset classes and therefore our asset management revenues. 

See &#8220;Assets under Management or Supervision&#8221; herein. 

Performance-based Income and Other 

Performance-based income and other revenues were a loss of $101 million in the current quarter, representing a decrease from the prior year quarter, primarily due to the reversal of accrued carried interest in certain private equity and real estate funds. 

Performance-based income and other revenues were a loss of $47 million in the current year period, representing a 110% decrease from the prior year period, primarily due to lower accrued carried interest in certain private equity funds, losses on investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans compared with gains in the prior year period, and mark-to-market losses on public investments. 

Non-interest Expenses 

Non-interest expenses of $1,052 million in the current quarter decreased 3% from the prior year quarter as a result of lower Compensation and benefits. 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses decreased in the current quarter primarily due to lower discretionary incentive compensation driven by lower asset management revenues, partially offset by higher salary costs. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expenses were relatively unchanged. 

September 2022 Form 10-Q 15 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Non-interest expenses of $3,321 million in the current year period increased 1% from the prior year period as a result of higher Non-compensation expenses, partially offset with lower Compensation and benefits. 

&#8226; Compensation and benefits expenses decreased in the current year period primarily due to lower discretionary incentive compensation driven by lower asset management revenues and lower expenses related to certain deferred compensation plans linked to investment performance, partially offset by higher salary costs, including the impact of incremental compensation as a result of the Eaton Vance acquisition. 

&#8226; Non-compensation expenses increased in the current year period primarily due to incremental expenses as a result of the Eaton Vance acquisition.

Accounting Development Updates 

The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued certain accounting updates that apply to us. Accounting updates not listed below were assessed and either determined to be not applicable or to not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations upon adoption. 

The following accounting updates are currently being evaluated, however, we do not expect a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations upon adoption: 

&#8226; Financial Instruments&#8212;Credit Losses. This accounting update eliminates the accounting guidance for Troubled Debt Restructurings (&#8220;TDRs&#8221;) and requires new disclosures regarding certain modifications of financing receivables ( i.e. , principal forgiveness, interest rate reductions, other-than-insignificant payment delays and term extensions) to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The update also requires disclosure of current period gross charge-offs by year of origination for financing receivables measured at amortized cost. The ASU is effective January 1, 2023 with early adoption permitted. 

&#8226; Derivatives and Hedging. The accounting update allows entities to designate fair value hedging relationships to multiple layers in a closed portfolio of prepayable and non-prepayable financial assets. It also provides additional guidance on the accounting for and disclosure of hedge basis adjustments under the portfolio layer method. As of the adoption date, entities are permitted to reclassify HTM debt securities to AFS if the securities will be included in a closed portfolio that are designated in a portfolio layer method hedge. The ASU is effective January 1, 2023 with early adoption permitted. 

&#8226; Fair Value Measurement . This accounting update clarifies, consistent with our current accounting policy, that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. The update also requires additional disclosures including the fair value of equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions, the nature and remaining duration of the restriction and circumstances that could cause the restriction to lapse. The ASU is effective January 1, 2024 with early adoption permitted. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions (see Note 1 to the financial statements). We believe that of our significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to the financial statements in the 2021 Form 10-K and Note 2 to the financial statements), the fair value, goodwill and intangible assets, legal and regulatory contingencies and income taxes policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. For a further discussion about our critical accounting policies, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Critical Accounting Policies&#8221; in the 2021 Form 10-K.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our liquidity and capital policies are established and maintained by senior management, with oversight by the Asset/Liability Management Committee and the Board of Directors (&#8220;Board&#8221;). Through various risk and control committees, senior management reviews business performance relative to these policies, monitors the availability of alternative sources of financing, and oversees the liquidity, interest rate and currency sensitivity of our asset and liability position. Our Treasury department, Firm Risk Committee, Asset/Liability Management Committee, and other committees and control groups assist in evaluating, monitoring and managing the impact that our business activities have on our balance sheet, liquidity and capital structure. Liquidity and capital matters are reported regularly to the Board and the Risk Committee of the Board.
