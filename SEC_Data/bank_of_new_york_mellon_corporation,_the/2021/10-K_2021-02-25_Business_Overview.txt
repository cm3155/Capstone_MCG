Competition 

BNY Mellon is subject to competition in all aspects and areas of our business. Our Investment Services business competes with domestic and international financial services firms that offer custody services, corporate trust services, clearing services, collateral management services, credit services, securities brokerage, foreign exchange services, derivatives, depositary receipt services and integrated cash management solutions and related products, as well as a wide range of technology service providers, such as financial services data processing firms. Our Investment and Wealth Management business competes with domestic and international investment management and wealth management firms, hedge funds, investment banking companies and other financial services companies, including trust banks, brokerage firms and insurance companies, as well as a wide range of technology service providers. 

Competition is based on a number of factors including, among others, customer service, transaction execution, capital or access to capital, quality and range of products and services offered, technological innovation and expertise, price, reputation, rates, lending limits and customer convenience. Competition also varies based on the types of clients, customers, industries and geographies served. Our ability to continue to compete effectively also depends in large part on our ability to attract new employees and retain and motivate our existing employees, while managing compensation and other costs. Competition in the financial services industry continues to be intense. Our competitive position may be affected by institutions that are not similarly subject to extensive regulation and whose compensatory arrangements are not subject to the same regulatory and supervisory frameworks that apply to us. 

As part of our business strategy, we seek to distinguish ourselves from competitors by the wide breadth of services and capabilities and the level of service we deliver to our clients. We also believe that technological innovation is an important competitive factor. For this reason, we have made and continue to make substantial investments in this area so we can continue to scale and digitize our operating model. 

For additional discussion regarding competition, see &#8220;MD&#38;A &#8211; Risk Factors &#8211; We are subject to competition in all aspects of our business, which could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability&#8221; and &#8220;MD&#38;A &#8211; Risk Factors &#8211; Our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to attract, retain and motivate employees&#8221; in the Annual Report, which are incorporated herein by reference.
