Key 2022 events
Alcentra

On Nov. 1, 2022, we completed the sale of BNY
Alcentra Group Holdings, Inc. (together with its
subsidiaries, “Alcentra”). At Oct. 31, 2022, Alcentra
had $32 billion in AUM concentrated in senior
secured loans, high yield bonds, private credit,
structured credit, special situations and multi-strategy
credit strategies.

Repositioning the securities portfolio

In the fourth quarter of 2022, we took actions to
reposition the securities portfolio to improve the
trajectory of our net interest revenue. We sold
approximately $3 billion of longer-dated lower
yielding municipal and corporate bonds. These
securities were replaced with significantly higher
yielding securities. As a result of the repositioning,
we recorded net securities losses of $449 million
(pre-tax) in investment and other revenue.

Goodwill impairment
In the third quarter of 2022, we recorded a $680

million impairment of the goodwill associated with
the Investment Management reporting unit, which

BNY Mellon 3

was driven by lower market values and a higher
discount rate. This goodwill impairment represents a
non-cash charge and did not affect BNY Mellon’s
liquidity position, tangible common equity or
regulatory capital ratios. See “Critical accounting
estimates” for additional information.

Leadership succession

In March 2022, Todd Gibbons announced his
decision to retire as Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”)
and member of the Board of Directors effective Aug.
31, 2022. The Board of Directors appointed Robin
Vince to the position of President and CEO after Mr.
Gibbons retired. Since 2020, Mr. Vince had served
as Vice Chair of BNY Mellon and CEO of Global
Market Infrastructure, which includes BNY Mellon’s
Pershing, Treasury Services, and Clearance and
Collateral Management lines of business, as well as
Markets & Execution Services.

Dermot McDonogh joined BNY Mellon on Nov. 1,
2022, and effective Feb. 1, 2023, succeeded Emily
Portney as the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”). Ms.
Portney served as the CFO since July 19, 2020, and
has assumed a new position leading the Company’s
Asset Servicing business.

Summary of financial highlights

We reported net income applicable to common
shareholders of $2.4 billion, or $2.90 per diluted
common share, in 2022, including the negative
impact of notable items. Notable items in 2022
include goodwill impairment in the Investment
Management reporting unit, a net loss from
repositioning the securities portfolio, severance
expense, litigation reserves, the accelerated
amortization of deferred costs for depositary receipts
services related to Russia and net gains on disposals
(reflected in investment and other revenue).
Excluding notable items, net income applicable to
common shareholders was $3.7 billion (Non-GAAP),
or $4.59 (Non-GAAP) per diluted common share, in
2022. In 2021, net income applicable to common
shareholders of BNY Mellon was $3.6 billion, or
$4.14 per diluted common share, including the
negative impact of notable items. Notable items in
2021 include litigation reserves, severance expense
and net gains on disposals (reflected in investment
and other revenue). Excluding notable items, net
income applicable to common shareholders was $3.6

billion (Non-GAAP), or $4.24 (Non-GAAP) per
diluted common share, in 2021.

The highlights below are based on 2022 compared
with 2021, unless otherwise noted.

* Total revenue increased 3%, or 6% (Non-GAAP)
excluding notable items, primarily reflecting:

* Fee revenue was essentially flat primarily
reflecting lower market values, the
unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar
and the accelerated amortization of deferred
costs for depositary receipts services related
to Russia, partially offset by lower money
market fee waivers. (See “Fee and other
revenue” beginning on page 6.)

¢ Investment and other revenue decreased,
primarily reflecting the net loss from
repositioning the securities portfolio. (See
“Fee and other revenue” beginning on page
6.)

* Net interest revenue increased 34%, primarily
driven by higher interest rates on interest-
eaming assets, partially offset by higher
funding expense. (See “Net interest revenue”
beginning on page 9.)

¢ The provision for credit losses was $39 million
compared with a benefit of $231 million. The
increase was primarily driven by changes in the
macroeconomic environment forecast. (See

“Allowance for credit losses” beginning on page

34.)

¢ Noninterest expense increased 13%, primarily
reflecting the goodwill impairment in the
Investment Management reporting unit and
higher severance expense and litigation reserves.
Excluding notable items, noninterest expense
increased 5% (Non-GAAP), primarily reflecting
higher investments in growth, infrastructure and
efficiency initiatives and higher revenue-related
expenses, as well as the impact of inflation,
partially offset by an approximately 3% favorable
impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. (See
“Noninterest expense” on page 12.)

¢ Effective tax rate of 23.1%, or 19.1% excluding
notable items (Non-GAAP), primarily goodwill
impairment, in 2022. (See “Income taxes” on
page 12.)

¢ Return on common equity (“ROE”) was 6.5% for
2022. Excluding notable items, the adjusted ROE
was 10.3% (Non-GAAP) for 2022.

Results of Operations (continued)

¢ Return on tangible common equity ““ROTCE”)
was 13.4% (Non-GAAP) for 2022. Excluding
notable items, the adjusted ROTCE was 21.0%
(Non-GAAP) for 2022.

See “Supplemental Information — Explanation of
GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures”
beginning on page 104 for the reconciliation of the
Non-GAAP measures.

Metrics

* AUCY/A totaled $44.3 trillion at Dec. 31, 2022
compared with $46.7 trillion at Dec. 31, 2021.
The 5% decrease primarily reflects lower market
values and the unfavorable impact of a stronger
U.S. dollar, partially offset by client inflows and
net new business. (See “Fee and other revenue”
beginning on page 6.)

* AUM totaled $1.8 trillion at Dec. 31, 2022
compared with $2.4 trillion at Dec. 31, 2021.
The 25% decrease primarily reflects lower market
values, the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S.
dollar and the divestiture of Alcentra, partially
offset by net inflows. (See “Investment and
Wealth Management business segment”
beginning on page 18.)

Capital and liquidity

* Our CET1 ratio calculated under the Advanced
Approaches was 11.2% at Dec. 31, 2022 and
11.2% under the Standardized Approach at Dec.
31, 2021. This primarily reflects capital
generated through earnings, lower risk-weighted
assets (“RWAs’”’) and the impact of the Alcentra
sale, offset by the net decrease in accumulated
other comprehensive income and capital

deployed through dividends. (See “Capital”
beginning on page 40.)

« Our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 5.8% at Dec. 31,
2022, compared with 5.5% at Dec. 31, 2021. The
increase reflects lower average assets, partially
offset by a decrease in capital. (See “Capital”
beginning on page 40.)

Results of Operations (continued)

Investment services fees

Investment services fees increased 3% compared with
2021, primarily reflecting lower money market fee
waivers and higher client activity, partially offset by
the impact of prior year lost business in Pershing and
Corporate Trust, the unfavorable impact of a stronger
U.S. dollar, lower market values and the accelerated
amortization of deferred costs for depositary receipts
services related to Russia in the first quarter of 2022.

AUCYA totaled $44.3 trillion at Dec. 31, 2022, a
decrease of 5% compared with Dec. 31, 2021,
primarily reflecting lower market values and the
unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, partially
offset by client inflows and net new business.
AUCYA consisted of 33% equity securities and 67%
fixed-income securities at Dec. 31, 2022 and 37%
equity securities and 63% fixed-income securities at
Dec. 31, 2021.

See “Securities Services business segment” and
“Market and Wealth Services business segment” in
“Review of business segments” for additional details.

Investment management and performance fees

Investment management and performance fees
decreased 8% compared with 2021, primarily
reflecting lower market values, the unfavorable
impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, the mix of
cumulative net inflows, the impact of the Alcentra
divestiture and lower equity income, partially offset
by lower money market fee waivers. Performance
fees were $75 million in 2022 and $107 million in
2021. Ona constant currency basis (Non-GAAP),
investment management and performance fees
decreased 4% compared with 2021. See
“Supplemental Information — Explanation of GAAP
and Non-GAAP financial measures” beginning on
page 104 for the reconciliation of Non-GAAP
measures.

AUM was $1.8 trillion at Dec. 31, 2022, a decrease of
25% compared with Dec. 31, 2021, primarily
reflecting lower market values, the unfavorable
impact of a stronger U.S. dollar and the divestiture of
Alcentra, partially offset by net inflows.

See “Investment and Wealth Management business
segment” in “Review of business segments” for
additional details regarding the drivers of investment

management and performance fees, AUM and AUM
flows.

Foreign exchange revenue

Foreign exchange revenue is primarily driven by the
volume of client transactions and the spread realized
on these transactions, both of which are impacted by
market volatility, the impact of foreign currency
hedging activities and foreign currency
remeasurement gain (loss). In 2022, foreign
exchange revenue increased 3% compared with 2021,
primarily reflecting higher volatility, partially offset
by lower volumes. Foreign exchange revenue is
primarily reported in the Securities Services business
segment and, to a lesser extent, the Market and
Wealth Services and Investment and Wealth
Management business segments and the Other
segment.

Financing-related fees

Financing-related fees, which are primarily reported
in the Market and Wealth Services and Securities
Services business segments, include capital market
fees, loan commitment fees and credit-related fees.
Financing-related fees decreased 10% in 2022
compared with 2021, primarily reflecting lower
capital market fees, including underwriting fees.

Distribution and servicing fees

Distribution and servicing fees earned from mutual
funds are primarily based on average assets in the
funds and the sales of funds that we manage or
administer, and are primarily reported in the
Investment Management business. These fees, which
include 12b-1 fees, fluctuate with the overall level of
net sales, the relative mix of sales between share
classes, the funds’ market values and money market
fee waivers.

Distribution and servicing fees were $130 million in
2022 compared with $112 million in 2021, driven by
lower money market fee waivers. The impact of
distribution and servicing fees on income in any one
period is partially offset by distribution and servicing
expense paid to other financial intermediaries to
cover their costs for distribution and servicing of
mutual funds. Distribution and servicing expense is
recorded as noninterest expense on the income
statement.

Investment and other revenue

Investment and other revenue includes income or loss
from consolidated investment management funds,
seed capital gains or losses, other trading revenue or
loss, renewable energy investments losses, income
from corporate and bank-owned life insurance
contracts, other investment gains or losses, gains or
losses from disposals, expense reimbursements from
our CIBC Mellon joint venture, other income or loss
and net securities gains or losses. The income or loss
from consolidated investment management funds
should be considered together with the net income or
loss attributable to noncontrolling interests, which
reflects the portion of the consolidated funds for
which we do not have an economic interest and is
reflected below net income as a separate line item on
the consolidated income statement. Other trading
revenue or loss primarily includes the impact of
market-risk hedging activity related to our seed
capital investments in investment management funds,
non-foreign currency derivative and fixed income
trading, and other hedging activity. Investments in
renewable energy generate losses in investment and
other revenue that are more than offset by benefits
and credits recorded to the provision for income
taxes. Other investment gains or losses includes fair
value changes of non-readily marketable strategic
equity, private equity and other investments. Expense
reimbursements from our CIBC Mellon joint venture
relate to expenses incurred by BNY Mellon on behalf
of the CIBC Mellon joint venture. Other income
includes various miscellaneous revenues.

N/M — Not meaningful.

Net interest revenue increased 34% compared with
2021, primarily reflecting higher interest rates on
interest-earning assets, partially offset by higher
funding expense.

Net interest margin increased 29 basis points
compared with 2021. The increase primarily reflects
the factors mentioned above.

Average interest-earning assets decreased 6%
compared with 2021. The decrease primarily reflects
lower interest-bearing deposit assets and lower
securities balances, partially offset by higher loan
balances.

Average non-U.S. dollar deposits comprised
approximately 25% of our average total deposits in
2022 and 2021. Approximately 40% of the average
non-U.S. dollar deposits in 2022 and 2021 were euro-
denominated.

Net interest revenue in future periods will depend on
the level and mix of client deposits and deposit rates,
as well as the level and shape of the yield curve.
Based on the market implied forward interest rates as
of the reporting date, we expect net interest revenue
for the year ended Dec. 31, 2023 to increase when
compared to the year ended Dec. 31, 2022.

Total noninterest expense increased 13% compared
with 2021. The increase primarily reflects goodwill
impairment in the Investment Management reporting
unit and higher severance expense and litigation
reserves. Excluding notable items, noninterest
expense increased 5% (Non-GAAP), primarily
reflecting higher investments in growth, infrastructure
and efficiency initiatives and higher revenue-related
expenses, as well as the impact of inflation, partially
offset by an approximately 3% favorable impact of a
stronger U.S. dollar. The investments in growth,
infrastructure and efficiency initiatives are primarily
included in staff, software and equipment, and
professional, legal and other purchased services
expenses. See “Supplemental Information —
Explanation of GAAP and Non-GAAP financial
measures” beginning on page 104 for the
reconciliation of the Non-GAAP measure.

We expect noninterest expense for the year ended
Dec. 31, 2023 to increase, but at a slower pace when
compared with the year ended Dec. 31, 2022; the
increase is driven by higher revenue-related expenses
and higher investments in growth, infrastructure and
efficiency initiatives, as well as the impact of
inflation, partially offset by the benefit of efficiency
initiatives.

Results of Operations (continued)

Review of business segments

We have an internal information system that produces
performance data along product and service lines for
our three principal business segments: Securities
Services, Market and Wealth Services and Investment
and Wealth Management, and the Other segment.

Business segment accounting principles

Our business segment data has been determined on an
internal management basis of accounting, rather than
the generally accepted accounting principles
(“GAAP”) used for consolidated financial reporting.
These measurement principles are designed so that
reported results of the business will track their
economic performance.

For information on the accounting principles of our
business segments, the primary products and services
in each line of business, the primary types of revenue
by line of business and how our business segments
are presented and analyzed, see Note 24 of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Business segment results are subject to
reclassification when organizational changes are
made, or for refinements in revenue and expense
allocation methodologies. Refinements are typically
reflected on a prospective basis. There were no
reclassification or organizational changes in 2022.

The results of our business segments may be
influenced by client and other activities that vary by
quarter. In the first quarter, staff expense typically
increases reflecting the vesting of long-term stock
awards for retirement-eligible employees. Prior to
2022, in the third quarter, staff expense typically
increased reflecting the annual employee merit
increase. In 2022, this increase was reflected in the
second quarter. In the third quarter, volume-related
fees may decline due to reduced client activity. In the
fourth quarter, we typically incur higher business

development and marketing expenses; however, 2020
was an exception due to the impact of the coronavirus
pandemic. In our Investment and Wealth
Management business segment, performance fees are
typically higher in the fourth and first quarters, as
those quarters represent the end of the measurement
period for many of the performance fee-eligible
relationships.

The results of our business segments may also be
impacted by the translation of financial results
denominated in foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar.
We are primarily impacted by activities denominated
in the British pound and the euro. On a consolidated
basis and in our Securities Services and Market and
Wealth Services business segments, we typically have
more foreign currency-denominated expenses than
revenues. However, our Investment and Wealth
Management business segment typically has more
foreign currency-denominated revenues than
expenses. Overall, currency fluctuations impact the
year-over-year growth rate in the Investment and
Wealth Management business segment more than the
Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services
business segments. However, currency fluctuations,
in isolation, are not expected to significantly impact
net income on a consolidated basis.

Fee revenue in the Investment and Wealth
Management business segment, and to a lesser extent
the Securities Services and Market and Wealth
Services business segments, is impacted by the global
market fluctuations. At Dec. 31, 2022, we estimated
that a 5% change in global equity markets, spread
evenly throughout the year, would impact fee revenue
by less than 1% and diluted earnings per common
share by $0.04 to $0.07.

See Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for the consolidating schedules which
show the contribution of our business segments to our
overall profitability.

Review of financial results

AUC/A of $31.4 trillion decreased 9% compared with
Dec. 31, 2021, primarily reflecting lower market
values and the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S.
dollar, partially offset by client inflows and net new
business.

Total revenue of $8.0 billion increased 11%
compared with 2021. The drivers of total revenue by
line of business are indicated below.

Asset Servicing revenue of $6.3 billion increased
11% compared with 2021, primarily reflecting higher
net interest revenue, lower money market fee waivers
and higher client activity, partially offset by the
unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar and
lower market values.

Issuer Services revenue of $1.7 billion increased 11%
compared with 2021, primarily reflecting higher net
interest revenue and lower money market fee waivers,
partially offset by the accelerated amortization of
deferred costs for depositary receipts services related
to Russia.

Market and regulatory trends are driving investable
assets toward lower fee asset management products at
reduced margins for our clients. These dynamics are
also negatively impacting our investment services
fees. However, at the same time, these trends are
providing additional outsourcing opportunities as
clients and other market participants seek to comply
with regulations and reduce their operating costs.

Noninterest expense of $6.3 billion increased 8%
compared with 2021, primarily reflecting higher
investments in growth, infrastructure and efficiency
initiatives, as well as the impact of inflation, partially
offset by the favorable impact of a stronger U.S.
dollar.

Business segment description

Our Investment and Wealth Management business
segment consists of two distinct lines of business,
Investment Management and Wealth Management,
which have a combined AUM of $1.8 trillion as of
Dec. 31, 2022.

BNY Mellon Investment Management is a leading
global asset manager and consists of our seven
specialist investment firms and global distribution
network to deliver a highly diversified portfolio of
investment strategies to institutional and retail clients
globally.

Our Investment Management model provides
specialized expertise from seven respected investment
firms offering solutions across every major asset
class, with backing from the proven stewardship and

global presence of BNY Mellon. Each investment
firm has its own individual culture, investment
philosophy and proprietary investment process. This
approach brings our clients clear, independent
thinking from highly experienced investment
professionals.

The investment firms offer a broad range of actively
managed equity, fixed income, alternative and
hability-driven investments, along with passive
products and cash management. Our six majority-
owned investment firms are as follows: ARX,
Dreyfus, Insight Investment, Mellon, Newton
Investment Management and Walter Scott. BNY
Mellon owns a non-controlling interest in Siguler
Guff.

In November 2022, BNY Mellon sold Alcentra. As
part of the sale agreement, Investment Management
will continue to offer Alcentra’s capabilities in BNY
Mellon’s sub-advised funds and in select regions via
its global distribution platform. BNY Mellon will
continue to provide Alcentra with ongoing asset
servicing support.

In addition to its investment firms, Investment
Management has multiple global distribution entities,
which are responsible for distributing the investment
solutions developed and managed by the investment
firms, as well as responsibility for management and
distribution of our U.S. mutual funds and certain
offshore money market funds.

BNY Mellon Wealth Management provides
investment management, custody, wealth and estate
planning, private banking services, investment
servicing and information management. BNY Mellon
Wealth Management has $269 billion in client assets
as of Dec. 31, 2022, and more than 30 offices in the
U.S. and internationally.

Wealth Management clients include individuals,
families and institutions. Institutions include family
offices, charitable gift programs and endowments and
foundations. We work with clients to build, manage
and sustain wealth across generations and market
cycles.

The wealth business differentiates itself with a
comprehensive wealth management framework called
Active Wealth that seeks to empower clients to build
and sustain long-term wealth.

BNY Mellon 19

Results of Operations (continued)

The results of the Investment and Wealth
Management business segment are driven by a blend
of daily, monthly and quarterly averages of AUM by
product type. The overall level of AUM for a given
period is determined by:

* the beginning level of AUM;

« the net flows of new assets during the period
resulting from new business wins and existing
client inflows, reduced by the loss of clients and
existing client outflows; and

* the impact of market price appreciation or
depreciation, foreign exchange rates and
investment firm acquisitions or divestitures.

The mix of AUM is a result of the historical growth
rates of equity and fixed income markets and the
cumulative net flows of our investment firms as a
result of client asset allocation decisions. Actively
managed equity, multi-asset and alternative assets
typically generate higher percentage fees than fixed-
income and liability-driven investments and cash.
Also, actively managed assets typically generate
higher management fees than indexed or passively
managed assets of the same type. Market and
regulatory trends have resulted in increased demand
for lower fee asset management products and for
performance-based fees.

Investment management fees are dependent on the
overall level and mix of AUM and the management
fees expressed in basis points (one-hundredth of one
percent) charged for managing those assets.
Management fees are typically subject to fee
schedules based on the overall level of assets
managed for a single client or by individual asset
class and style. This is most common for institutional
clients where we typically manage substantial assets
for individual accounts.

Performance fees are generally calculated as a
percentage of a portfolio’s performance in excess of a
benchmark index or a peer group’s performance.

A key driver of organic growth in investment
management and performance fees is the amount of
net new AUM flows. Overall market conditions are
also key drivers, with a significant long-term
economic driver being growth of global financial
assets.

Net interest revenue is determined by loan and
deposit volumes and the interest rate spread between
customer rates and internal funds transfer rates on
loans and deposits. Expenses in the Investment and
Wealth Management business segment are mainly
driven by staff and distribution and servicing
expenses.

Review of financial results

AUM of $1.8 trillion decreased 25% compared with
Dec. 31, 2021, primarily reflecting lower market
values, the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S.
dollar and the divestiture of Alcentra, partially offset
by net inflows.

Net long-term strategy inflows were $30 billion in
2022, driven by inflows of liability-driven
investments, partially offset by outflows of fixed
income, equity and multi-asset and alternative
investments. Short-term strategy outflows were $12
billion in 2022.

Total revenue of $3.6 billion decreased 12%
compared with 2021. The drivers of total revenue by
line of business are indicated below.

Investment Management revenue of $2.4 billion
decreased 16% compared with 2021, primarily
reflecting lower market values, the unfavorable
impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, the mix of
cumulative net inflows, lower seed capital results and
the impact of the Alcentra divestiture, partially offset
by lower money market fee waivers.

Wealth Management revenue of $1.2 billion
decreased 4% compared with 2021, primarily
reflecting lower market values, partially offset by
higher net interest revenue.

Revenue generated in the Investment and Wealth
Management business segment included 35% from
non-U.S. sources in 2022, compared with 38% in
2021.

Noninterest expense of $3.5 billion increased 24%
compared with 2021, primarily reflecting goodwill
impairment in the Investment Management reporting
unit and investments in growth initiatives, partially
offset by the favorable impact of a strong U.S. dollar.

« the leasing portfolio;

* corporate treasury activities, including our
securities portfolio;

« derivatives and other trading activity;

* corporate and bank-owned life insurance;

« renewable energy and other corporate
investments; and

* certain business exits.

gains (losses) from leasing operations;

* net interest revenue (expense) and derivatives and
other corporate treasury activities;

* other revenue from certain business exits;

* investment and other revenue from corporate and
bank-owned life insurance, gains (losses)
associated with investment securities and other
assets, including renewable energy; and

« fee revenue from the elimination of the results of
certain services provided between segments,
which are also provided to third parties.

Expenses include:

« direct expenses supporting leasing, investing and
funding activities; and

* expenses not directly attributable to Securities
Services, Market and Wealth Services and
Investment and Wealth Management operations.

Review of financial results

Loss before taxes was $775 million in 2022 compared
with $252 million in 2021.

Investment and other revenue decreased $388 million
compared with 2021, primarily reflecting a $449
million net loss from repositioning the securities
portfolio, partially offset by an impairment for a
renewable energy investment recorded in 2021.

Noninterest expense increased $117 million
compared with 2021, primarily reflecting higher
severance expense.

International operations

Our primary international activities consist of asset
servicing in our Securities Services business segment,
global payment services in our Market and Wealth
Services business segment and investment
management in our Investment and Wealth
Management business segment.

Our clients include central banks and sovereigns,
financial institutions, asset managers, insurance
companies, corporations, local authorities and high-
net-worth individuals and family offices. Through
our global network of offices, we have developed a
deep understanding of local requirements and cultural
needs, and we pride ourselves on providing dedicated
service through our multilingual sales, marketing and
client service teams.

At Dec. 31, 2022, approximately 50% of our total
employees (full-time and part-time employees) were
based outside the U.S., with approximately 10,600
employees in EMEA, approximately 16,100
employees in APAC and approximately 900
employees in other global locations, primarily Brazil.

We are a leading global asset manager. Our
international operations managed 53% of BNY

In Europe, we maintain capabilities to service
Undertakings for Collective Investment in
Transferable Securities and alternative investment
funds. We offer a full range of tailored solutions for
investment companies, financial institutions and
institutional investors across most European markets.

We are a provider of non-U.S. government securities,
fixed income and equities clearance, settling
securities transactions directly in European markets,
and using a high-quality and established network of
local agents in non-European markets.

We have extensive experience providing trade and
cash services to financial institutions and central
banks outside of the U.S. In addition, we offer a
broad range of servicing and fiduciary products to
financial institutions, corporations and central banks.
In emerging markets, we lead with custody, global
payments and issuer services, introducing other
products as the markets mature. For more established
markets, our focus is on global investment services.

We are also a full-service global provider of foreign
exchange services, actively trading in over 100 of the
world’s currencies. We serve clients from trading
desks located in Europe, Asia and North America.

Our financial results, as well as our levels of AUC/A
and AUM, are impacted by translation from foreign
currencies to the U.S. dollar. We are primarily
impacted by activities denominated in the British
pound and the euro. Ifthe U.S. dollar depreciates
against these currencies, the translation impact is a
higher level of fee revenue, net interest revenue,
noninterest expense and AUC/A and AUM.
Conversely, if the U.S. dollar appreciates, the
translated levels of fee revenue, net interest revenue,
noninterest expense and AUC/A and AUM will be
lower.

International clients accounted for 36% of revenues in
2022, compared with 38% in 2021. Net income from
international operations was $1.7 billion in 2022,
compared with $1.8 billion in 2021.

In 2022, revenues from EMEA were $4.0 billion,
compared with $4.1 billion in 2021. The 4% decrease
primarily reflects lower revenue in the Investment
and Wealth Management business segment, partially
offset by higher revenue in the Securities Services
business segment. The decrease in revenue in the
Investment and Wealth Management business
segment primarily reflects the unfavorable impact of
a stronger U.S. dollar and lower market values. The
increase in revenue in the Securities Services business
segment primarily reflects higher net interest revenue,
partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a
stronger U.S. dollar.

The Securities Services, Investment and Wealth
Management and Market and Wealth Services
business segments generated 55%, 25% and 20% of
EMEA revenues, respectively. Net income from
EMEA was $880 million in 2022, compared with
$1.0 billion in 2021.

Revenues from APAC were $1.13 billion in 2022,
compared with $1.14 billion in 2021. The 1%
decrease primarily reflects lower revenue in the
Investment and Wealth Management business
segment, partially offset by higher revenue in the
Securities Services business segment. The decrease
in Investment and Wealth Management revenue was
primarily driven by the unfavorable impact of a
stronger U.S. dollar and lower market values.

The Securities Services, Market and Wealth Services
and Investment and Wealth Management business
segments generated 54%, 32% and 14% of APAC
revenues, respectively. Net income from APAC was
$432 million in 2022, compared with $445 million in
2021.

Critical accounting estimates

Our significant accounting policies are described in
Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements. Certain of these policies include critical
accounting estimates which require management to
make subjective or complex judgments about the
effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and
may change in subsequent periods. Our critical
accounting estimates are those related to the
allowance for credit losses, goodwill and other
intangibles and litigation and regulatory
contingencies. Management has discussed the
development and selection of the critical accounting
estimates with the Company’s Audit Committee.

Allowance for credit losses
The allowance for credit losses covers financial assets

subject to credit losses and measured at amortized
cost, including loans and lending-related

BNY Mellon 23

Results of Operations (continued)

commitments, held-to-maturity securities, certain
securities financing transactions and deposits with
banks. The allowance for credit losses is intended to
adjust the carrying value of these assets by an
estimated amount of credit losses that we expect to
incur over the life of the asset. Similarly, the
allowance for credit losses on lending-related
commitments and other off-balance sheet financial
instruments is meant to capture the credit losses that
we expect to recognize in these portfolios as of the
balance sheet date.

A quantitative methodology and qualitative
framework is used to estimate the allowance for
credit losses.

The quantitative component of our estimate uses
models and methodologies that categorize financial
assets based on product type, collateral type, and
other credit trends and risk characteristics, including
relevant information about past events, current
conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts
of future economic conditions that affect the
collectability of the recorded amounts. For the
quantitative component, we segment portfolios into
various major components including commercial
loans and lease financing, commercial real estate,
financial institutions, residential mortgages, and
other. The segmentation of our debt securities
portfolios is by major asset class and is influenced by
whether the security is structured or non-structured
(i.e., direct obligation), as well as the issuer type. The
components of the credit loss calculation for each
major portfolio or asset class include a probability of
default, loss given default and exposure at default, as
applicable, and their values depend on the forecast
behavior of variables in the macroeconomic
environment. We utilize a multi-scenario
macroeconomic forecast which includes a weighting
of three scenarios: a baseline and upside and
downside scenarios and allows us to develop our
estimate using a wide span of economic variables.
Our baseline scenario reflects a view on likely
performance of each global region and the other two
scenarios are designed relative to the baseline
scenario. This approach incorporates a reasonable
and supportable forecast period spanning the life of
the asset, and includes both an initial estimated
economic outlook component as well as a reversion
component for each economic input variable. The
length of each of the two components depends on the
underlying financial instrument, scenario, and
underlying economic input variable. In general, the

24 BNY Mellon

initial economic outlook period for each economic
input variable under each scenario ranges between
several months and two years. The speed at which
the scenario-specific forecasts revert to long-term
historical mean is based on observed historical
patterns of mean reversion at the economic variable
input level that are reflected in our model parameter
estimates. Certain macroeconomic variables such as
unemployment or home prices take longer to revert
after a contraction, though specific recovery times are
scenario-specific. Reversion will usually take longer
the further away the scenario-specific forecast is from
the historical mean. On a quarterly basis, and within
a developed governance structure, we update these
scenarios for current economic conditions and may
adjust the scenario weighting based on our economic
outlook. The Company uses its best judgment to
assess these economic conditions and loss data in
estimating the allowance for credit losses and these
estimates are subject to periodic refinement based on
changes to underlying external or Company-specific
historical data.

In the quantitative component of our estimate, we
measure expected credit losses using an individual
evaluation method if the risk characteristics of the
asset is no longer consistent with the portfolio or class
of asset. For these assets we do not employ the
macroeconomic model calculation but consider
factors such as payment status, collateral value, the
obligor’s financial condition, guarantor support, the
probability of collecting scheduled principal and
interest payments when due, and recovery
expectations if they can be reasonably estimated. For
loans, we measure the expected credit loss as the
difference between the amortized cost basis of the
loan and the present value of the expected future cash
flows from the borrower which is generally
discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, or the
fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral
dependent. We generally consider nonperforming
loans as well as loans that have been or are
anticipated to be modified and classified under a
troubled debt restructuring for individual evaluation
given the risk characteristics of such loans.

Available-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair
value. When an available-for-sale debt security is in
an unrealized loss position, we employ a
methodology to identify and estimate the credit loss
portion of the unrealized loss position. The
measurement of expected credit losses is performed at
the security level and is based on our best single

Results of Operations (continued)

estimate of cash flows, on a discounted basis;
however, we do not specifically employ the
macroeconomic forecasting models and scenarios
summarized above.

The qualitative component of our estimate for the
allowance for credit losses is intended to capture
expected losses that may not have been fully captured
in the quantitative component. Through an
established governance structure, management
determines the qualitative allowance each period
based on an evaluation of various internal and
environmental factors which include: scenario
weighting and sensitivity risk, credit concentration
risk, economic conditions and other considerations.
We have made and may continue to make
adjustments for idiosyncratic risks.

To the extent actual results differ from forecasts or
management’s judgment, the allowance for credit
losses may be greater or less than future charge-offs
and recoveries.

Our allowance for credit losses is sensitive to a
number of inputs, most notably the credit ratings
assigned to each borrower as well as macroeconomic
forecast assumptions that are incorporated in our
estimate of credit losses through the expected life of
the loan portfolio. Thus, as the macroeconomic
environment and related forecasts change, the
allowance for credit losses may change materially.
The following sensitivity analyses do not represent
management’s expectations of the deterioration of our
portfolios or the economic environment, but are
provided as hypothetical scenarios to assess the
sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses to
changes in key inputs. If commercial real estate
property values were increased 10% and all other
credits were rated one grade better, the quantitative
allowance would have decreased by $36 million, and
if commercial real estate property values were
decreased 10% and all other credits were rated one
grade worse, the quantitative allowance would have
increased by $71 million. Our multi-scenario based
macroeconomic forecast used in determining the Dec.
31, 2022 allowance for credit losses consisted of three
scenarios. The baseline scenario reflects slowing
GDP growth through mid-2023, slightly rising
unemployment through the end of 2023, and slightly
declining commercial real estate prices through the
end of 2023. The upside scenario reflects strong
GDP growth in early 2023, declining unemployment
and higher commercial real estate prices compared

with the baseline. The downside scenario
contemplates negative GDP growth through the third
quarter of 2023, increasing unemployment through
the first quarter of 2024 and lower commercial real
estate prices than the baseline. At Dec. 31, 2022, we
placed the most weighting on our baseline and
downside scenarios, with the remaining weighting
placed on the upside scenario. From a sensitivity
perspective, at Dec. 31, 2022, if we had applied 100%
weighting to the downside scenario, the quantitative
allowance for credit losses would have been
approximately $83 million higher.

Goodwill and other intangibles

We initially record all assets and liabilities acquired
in purchase acquisitions, including goodwill,
indefinite-lived intangibles and other intangibles, in
accordance with Accounting Standards Codification
(“ASC”) 805, Business Combinations. Goodwill,
indefinite-lived intangibles and other intangibles are
subsequently accounted for in accordance with ASC
350, Intangibles — Goodwill and Other. The initial
measurement of goodwill and intangibles requires
judgment concerning estimates of the fair value of the
acquired assets and liabilities. Goodwill ($16.2
billion at Dec. 31, 2022) and indefinite-lived
intangible assets ($2.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2022) are
not amortized but are subject to tests for impairment
annually or more often if events or circumstances
indicate it is more likely than not they may be
impaired. Other intangible assets are amortized over
their estimated useful lives and are subject to
impairment if events or circumstances indicate a
possible inability to realize the carrying value.

Goodwill

BNY Mellon’s business segments include six
reporting units for which annual goodwill impairment
testing is performed in accordance with ASC 350,
Intangibles — Goodwill and Other.

The goodwill impairment test compares the estimated
fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying
amount, including goodwill. Ifthe estimated fair
value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying
amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered
not impaired. However, if the carrying amount of the
reporting unit were to exceed its estimated fair value,
an impairment loss would be recorded.

BNY Mellon 25

Results of Operations (continued)

Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is
subject to uncertainty as it is reliant on estimates of
cash flows that extend far into the future, and, by
their nature, are difficult to estimate over such an
extended time frame. In the future, changes in the
assumptions or the discount rate could produce a
material non-cash goodwill impairment.

In the second quarter of 2022, we performed our
annual goodwill impairment test on all six reporting
units using an income approach to estimate the fair
values of each reporting unit. Estimated cash flows
used in the income approach were based on
management’s projections as of April 1, 2022. The
discount rate applied to these cash flows was 10%.

As a result of the annual goodwill impairment test of
the six reporting units, no goodwill impairment was
recognized. The fair values of four of the Company’s
reporting units were substantially in excess of the
respective reporting units’ carrying value. The Issuer
Services reporting unit, with $2.4 billion of allocated
goodwill, which is one of the two reporting units in
the Securities Services business segment, exceeded its
carrying value by approximately 10%. The
Investment Management reporting unit, with $7.2
billion of allocated goodwill, which is one of the two
reporting units in the Investment and Wealth
Management segment, exceeded its carrying value by
approximately 6%.

An interim test 1s performed when events or
circumstances occur that may indicate that it is more
likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit
may be less than its carrying value.

In the third quarter 2022, due to decreases in market
values and the related outlook as well as increased
market interest rates, we performed an interim
goodwill impairment test of the Investment
Management reporting unit which had $7.0 billion of
allocated goodwill. The fair value of the Investment
Management reporting unit was determined to be 7%
below its carrying value, resulting in a goodwill
impairment charge of $680 million. This goodwill
impairment represents a non-cash charge and did not
affect BNY Mellon’s liquidity position, tangible
common equity or regulatory capital ratios. The cash
flow estimates for the Investment Management
reporting unit are impacted by projections of the level
and mix of assets under management, market values,
operating margins and long-term growth rates.

26 BNY Mellon

We determined the fair value of the Investment
Management reporting unit using an income approach
based on management’s projections as of Sept. 30,
2022. The discount rate applied to these cash flows
was 10.5% compared with the 10% discount rate used
in the annual impairment test conducted in the second
quarter of 2022. The increase was driven by a higher
risk free rate. In the third quarter of 2022, we
determined it was not necessary to perform an interim
goodwill impairment test for our other reporting
units.

In the fourth quarter of 2022, due to results of the
third quarter 2022 interim impairment test and the
macroeconomic conditions, we performed an
additional interim goodwill impairment test of the
Investment Management reporting unit, which had
$6.0 billion of allocated goodwill after the sale of
Alcentra on Nov. 1, 2022. The fair value of the
Investment Management reporting unit exceeded its
carrying value by approximately 3%. We determined
the fair value of the Investment Management
reporting unit using an income approach based on
management’s projections as of Dec. 31, 2022. The
discount rate applied to these cash flows was 10.5%.

As of Dec. 31, 2022, if the discount rate applied to
the estimated cash flows was increased or decreased
by 25 basis points, the fair value of the Investment
Management reporting unit would decrease or
increase by 4%, respectively. Similarly, if the long-
term growth rate was increased or decreased by 10
basis points, the fair value of the Investment
Management reporting unit would increase or
decrease by approximately 1%, respectively.

Intangible assets

Key judgments in accounting for intangible assets
include useful life and classification between
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets or
other intangible assets requiring amortization.

Indefinite-lived intangible assets ($2.6 billion at Dec.
31, 2022) are evaluated for impairment at least
annually by comparing their fair values, estimated
using discounted cash flow analyses, to their carrying
values. As a result of the annual evaluation, no
impairment was recognized, however, a $700 million
indefinite-lived intangible asset related to customer
relationships in the Investment Management business
exceeded its carrying value by approximately 3%.

Results of Operations (continued)

Other amortizing intangible assets ($329 million at
Dec. 31, 2022) are evaluated for impairment if events
and circumstances indicate a possible impairment.
Such evaluation of other intangible assets would be
initially based on undiscounted cash flow projections.

See Notes 1 and 7 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information
regarding goodwill, intangible assets and the annual
and interim impairment testing.

Litigation and regulatory contingencies

Significant estimates and judgments are required in
establishing an accrued liability for litigation and
regulatory contingencies. For additional information
on our policy, see “Legal proceedings” in Note 22 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Consolidated balance sheet review

One of our key risk management objectives is to
maintain a balance sheet that remains strong
throughout market cycles to meet the expectations of
our major stakeholders, including our shareholders,
clients, creditors and regulators.

We also seek to undertake overall liquidity risk,
including intraday liquidity risk, that stays within our
risk appetite. The objective of our balance sheet
management strategy is to maintain a balance sheet
that is characterized by strong liquidity and asset
quality, ready access to external funding sources at
competitive rates and a strong capital structure that
supports our risk-taking activities and is adequate to
absorb potential losses. In managing the balance
sheet, appropriate consideration is given to balancing
the competing needs of maintaining sufficient levels
of liquidity and complying with applicable
regulations and supervisory expectations while
optimizing profitability.

At Dec. 31, 2022, total assets were $406 billion,
compared with $444 billion at Dec. 31, 2021. The
decrease in total assets was primarily driven by lower
securities and interest-bearing deposits with the
Federal Reserve and other central banks, partially
offset by higher other assets. Deposit liabilities
totaled $279 billion at Dec. 31, 2022, compared with
$320 billion at Dec. 31, 2021. The decrease primarily
reflects lower noninterest-bearing (principally U.S.

offices), interest-bearing deposits in U.S. offices and
interest-bearing deposits in Non-U.S. offices. Total
interest-bearing deposit liabilities as a percentage of
total interest-earning assets were 58% at Dec. 31,
2022 and 60% at Dec. 31, 2021.

At Dec. 31, 2022, available funds totaled $138 billion
and includes cash and due from banks, interest-
bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and other
central banks, interest-bearing deposits with banks
and federal funds sold and securities purchased under
resale agreements. This compares with available
funds of $155 billion at Dec. 31, 2021. Total
available funds as a percentage of total assets were
34% at Dec. 31, 2022 and 35% at Dec. 31, 2021. For
additional information on our available funds, see
“Liquidity and dividends.”

Securities were $143 billion, or 35% of total assets, at
Dec. 31, 2022, compared with $159 billion, or 36%
of total assets, at Dec. 31, 2021. The decrease
primarily reflects unrealized pre-tax losses and lower
agency residential mortgage-backed securities
(“RMBS’”), partially offset by higher U.S. Treasury
securities. For additional information on our
securities portfolio, see “Securities” and Note 4 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Loans were $66 billion, or 16% of total assets, at Dec.
31, 2022, compared with $68 billion, or 15% of total
assets, at Dec. 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily
driven by lower margin loans, partially offset by
higher overdrafts, capital call financing and wealth
management mortgages. For additional information
on our loan portfolio, see “Loans” and Note 5 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Long-term debt totaled $30 billion at Dec. 31, 2022
and $26 billion at Dec. 31, 2021. Issuances were
partially offset by redemptions and maturities and a
decrease in the fair value of hedged long-term debt.
For additional information on long-term debt, see
“Liquidity and dividends” and Note 13 of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation total
shareholders’ equity decreased to $41 billion at Dec.
31, 2022 from $43 billion at Dec. 31, 2021. For
additional information, see “Capital” and Note 15 of

Securities

In the discussion of our securities portfolio, we have
included certain credit ratings information because
the information can indicate the degree of credit risk

to which we are exposed. Significant changes in
ratings classifications could indicate increased credit
risk for us and could be accompanied by an increase
in the allowance for credit losses and/or a reduction in
the fair value of our securities portfolio.

The fair value of our securities portfolio, including

related hedges, was $139.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2022,
compared with $158.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2021. The
decrease primarily reflects unrealized pre-tax losses

increase in U.S. Treasury securities.

At Dec. 31, 2022, the securities portfolio had a net
unrealized loss, including the impact of related
hedges, of $9.4 billion, compared with a net

unrealized gain, including the impact of related

Allowance for credit losses

Our credit strategy 1s to focus on investment grade clients who are active users of our non-credit services. Our
primary exposure to the credit risk of a customer consists of funded loans, unfunded contractual commitments to
lend, standby letters of credit (““SBLC”) and overdrafts associated with our custody and securities clearance
businesses.

The following table presents the changes in our allowance for credit losses.

Results of Operations (continued)

The provision for credit losses was $39 million in
2022 compared with a benefit of $231 million in
2021. The increase was primarily driven by changes
in the macroeconomic forecast.

The allowance for loan losses and allowance for
lending-related commitments represent
management’s estimate of lifetime expected losses in
our credit portfolio. This evaluation process is
subject to numerous estimates and judgments. To the
extent actual results differ from forecasts or
management’s judgment, the allowance for credit
losses may be greater or less than future charge-offs.

Based on an evaluation of the allowance for credit
losses as discussed in “Critical accounting estimates”
and Note | of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, we have allocated our allowance for
loans and lending-related commitments as presented
below.

(a) The allowance allocated to margins loans, overdrafts and
other loans was insignificant at both Dec. 31, 2022 and Dec.
31, 2021. We have rarely suffered a loss on these types of
loans.

The allocation of the allowance for credit losses is
inherently judgmental, and the entire allowance for
credit losses is available to absorb credit losses
regardless of the nature of the losses.

residential mortgages and wealth management
mortgage loans.

See “Nonperforming assets” in Note 1 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for our policy for
placing loans on nonaccrual status.

Deposits

We receive client deposits through the businesses in
the Securities Services, Market and Wealth Services
and Investment and Wealth Management segments
and we rely on those deposits as a low-cost and stable
source of funding.

Total deposits were $279.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2022, a
decrease of 13%, compared with $319.7 billion at
Dec. 31, 2021. The decrease primarily reflects lower
non-interest bearing deposits (principally U.S.
offices), interest-bearing deposits in U.S. offices and
interest-bearing deposits in non-U:S. offices.

Noninterest-bearing deposits were $78.0 billion at
Dec. 31, 2022, compared with $93.7 billion at Dec.
31, 2021. Interest-bearing deposits were primarily
demand deposits and totaled $201.0 billion at Dec.
31, 2022, compared with $226.0 billion at Dec. 31,
2021.

BNY Mellon 35

Results of Operations (continued)

The aggregate amount of deposits by foreign
customers in domestic offices was $61.2 billion at
Dec. 31, 2022 and $65.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2021.

Deposits in foreign offices totaled $98.3 billion at
Dec. 31, 2022 and $112.1 billion at Dec. 31, 2021.
These deposits were primarily overnight deposits.

Uninsured deposits are the portion of domestic
deposits accounts that exceed the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance limit.
Uninsured deposits in domestic deposit accounts are
generally demand deposits and totaled $156.6 billion

Short-term borrowings

We fund ourselves primarily through deposits and, to
a lesser extent, other short-term borrowings and long-
term debt. Short-term borrowings consist of federal
funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase
agreements, payables to customers and broker-
dealers, commercial paper and other borrowed funds.
Certain short-term borrowings, for example,
securities sold under repurchase agreements, require
the delivery of securities as collateral.

Federal funds purchased and securities sold under
repurchase agreements include repurchase agreement
activity with the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation
(“FICC”), where we record interest expense gross,
but the ending and average balances reflect the
impact of offsetting under enforceable netting
agreements. This activity primarily relates to
government securities collateralized resale and
repurchase agreements executed with clients that are
novated to and settle with the FICC.

Payables to customers and broker-dealers represent
funds awaiting reinvestment and short sale proceeds
payable on demand. Payables to customers and

36 BNY Mellon

broker-dealers are driven by customer trading activity
and market volatility.

The Bank of New York Mellon may issue
commercial paper that matures within 397 days from
the date of issue and is not redeemable prior to
maturity or subject to voluntary prepayment.

Other borrowed funds primarily include overdrafts of
sub-custodian account balances in our Securities
Services businesses, finance lease liabilities and
borrowings under lines of credit by our Pershing
subsidiaries. Overdrafts typically relate to timing
differences for settlements.

Liquidity and dividends

BNY Mellon defines liquidity as the ability of the
Parent and its subsidiaries to access funding or
convert assets to cash quickly and efficiently, or to
roll over or issue new debt, especially during periods
of market stress, at a reasonable cost, and in order to
meet its short-term (up to one year) obligations.
Funding liquidity risk is the risk that BNY Mellon
cannot meet its cash and collateral obligations at a
reasonable cost for both expected and unexpected
cash flow and collateral needs without adversely
affecting daily operations or our financial condition.
Funding liquidity risk can arise from funding
mismatches, market constraints from the inability to
convert assets into cash, the inability to hold or raise
cash, low overnight deposits, deposit run-off or
contingent liquidity events.

Changes in economic conditions or exposure to
credit, market, operational, legal and reputational
risks also can affect BNY Mellon’s liquidity risk
profile and are considered in our liquidity risk
framework. For additional information, see “Risk
Management — Liquidity Risk.”

The Parent’s policy is to have access to sufficient
unencumbered cash and cash equivalents at each
quarter-end to cover maturities and other forecasted
debt redemptions, net interest payments and net tax
payments for the following 18-month period, and to
provide sufficient collateral to satisfy transactions
subject to Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act.
As of Dec. 31, 2022, the Parent was in compliance
with this policy.

We monitor and control liquidity exposures and
funding needs within and across significant legal

entities, branches, currencies and business lines,

its intraday obligations under normal and reasonably
severe stressed conditions.

We define available funds for internal liquidity
management purposes as cash and due from banks,
interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve
and other central banks, interest-bearing deposits with
banks and federal funds sold and securities purchased
under resale agreements. The following table
presents our total available funds at period end and on
an average basis.

BNY Mellon also manages potential intraday
liquidity risks. We monitor and manage intraday
liquidity against existing and expected intraday liquid
resources (such as cash balances, remaining intraday
credit capacity, intraday contingency funding and
available collateral) to enable BNY Mellon to meet

Total available funds as a percentage of total assets 34% 35% 34% 37% 36%

Total available funds were $138.2 billion at Dec. 31,
2022, compared with $154.8 billion at Dec. 31, 2021.
The decrease was primarily due to lower interest-
bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and other
central banks and federal funds sold and securities
purchased under resale agreements.

Average non-core sources of funds, such as federal
funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase
agreements, trading liabilities, other borrowed funds
and commercial paper, were $16.9 billion for 2022
and $16.7 billion for 2021. The increase primarily
reflects higher trading liabilities and other borrowed
funds, partially offset by lower federal funds
purchased and securities sold under repurchase
agreements.

Average interest-bearing domestic deposits were
$111.5 billion for 2022 and $124.7 billion for 2021.
Average foreign deposits, primarily from our
European-based businesses included in the Securities
Services and Market and Wealth Services segments,
were $101.9 billion for 2022, compared with $112.5
billion for 2021. The decrease primarily reflects
client activity.

Average payables to customers and broker-dealers
were $17.1 billion for 2022 and $16.9 billion for

2021. Payables to customers and broker-dealers are
driven by customer trading activity and market
volatility.

Average long-term debt was $27.4 billion for 2022
and $25.8 billion for 2021.

Average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased to
$85.7 billion for 2022 from $86.6 billion for 2021,
primarily reflecting client activity.

A significant reduction of client activity in our
Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services
business segments would reduce our access to
deposits. See “Asset/liability management” for
additional factors that could impact our deposit
balances.

Sources of liquidity

The Parent’s major sources of liquidity are access to
the debt and equity markets, dividends from its
subsidiaries, and cash on hand and cash otherwise
made available in business-as-usual circumstances to
the Parent through a committed credit facility with
our intermediate holding company (“IHC”).

bank subsidiaries of the Parent had liquid assets of

ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries are
discussed in more detail in “Supervision and
Regulation — Capital Planning and Stress Testing —
Payment of Dividends, Stock Repurchases and Other
Capital Distributions” and in Note 19 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Pershing LLC has uncommitted lines of credit in
place for liquidity purposes which are guaranteed by
the Parent. Pershing LLC has two separate
uncommitted lines of credit amounting to $350
million in aggregate. Average borrowings under
these lines were less than $1 million, in aggregate, in
2022. Pershing Limited, an indirect UK-based
subsidiary of BNY Mellon, has two separate
uncommitted lines of credit amounting to $257
million in aggregate. Average borrowings under
these lines were $5 million, in aggregate, in 2022.

The double leverage ratio is the ratio of our equity
investment in subsidiaries divided by our
consolidated Parent company equity, which includes
our noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. In
short, the double leverage ratio measures the extent to
which equity in subsidiaries is financed by Parent
company debt. As the double leverage ratio
increases, this can reflect greater demands on a
company’s cash flows in order to service interest
payments and debt maturities. BNY Mellon’s double
leverage ratio is managed in a range considering the
high level of unencumbered available liquid assets
held in its principal subsidiaries (such as central bank
deposit placements and government securities), the
Company’s cash generating fee-based business
model, with fee revenue representing 79% of total
revenue in 2022, and the dividend capacity of our
banking subsidiaries. Our double leverage ratio was
120.5% at Dec. 31, 2022 and 119.3% at Dec. 31,
2021, and within the range targeted by management.

Uses of funds

The Parent’s major uses of funds are repurchases of
common stock, payment of dividends, principal and
interest payments on its borrowings, acquisitions and
additional investments in its subsidiaries.

In 2022, we paid $1.4 billion in dividends on our
common and preferred stock. Our common stock
dividend payout ratio was 49% for 2022.

In 2022, we repurchased 2.0 million common shares
at an average price of $61.08 per common share for a
total cost of $124 million.

Liquidity coverage ratio (“LCR”)

U.S. regulators have established an LCR that requires
certain banking organizations, including BNY
Mellon, to maintain a minimum amount of
unencumbered high-quality liquid assets (““HQLA”)
sufficient to withstand the net cash outflow under a
hypothetical standardized acute liquidity stress
scenario for a 30-day time horizon.

The following table presents BNY Mellon’s
consolidated HQLA at Dec. 31, 2022, and the average
HQLA and average LCR for the fourth quarter of
2022.

BNY Mellon and each of our affected domestic bank
subsidiaries were compliant with the U.S. LCR
requirements of at least 100% throughout 2022.

Statement of cash flows

The following summarizes the activity reflected on
the consolidated statement of cash flows. While this
information may be helpful to highlight certain macro
trends and business strategies, the cash flow analysis
may not be as relevant when analyzing changes in our
net earnings and net assets. We believe that in
addition to the traditional cash flow analysis, the
discussion related to liquidity and dividends and
asset/liability management herein may provide more
useful context in evaluating our liquidity position and
related activity.

Results of Operations (continued)

Net cash provided by operating activities was $15.1
billion in 2022, compared with $2.8 billion in 2021.
In 2022, cash flows provided by operations primarily
resulted from changes in trading assets and liabilities,
changes in accruals and other, net and earnings. In
2021, cash flows provided by operations primarily
resulted from earnings, partially offset by changes in
trading assets and liabilities and changes in accruals
and other, net.

Net cash provided by investing activities was $19.9
billion in 2022, compared with $19.7 billion in 2021.
In 2022, net cash provided by investing activities
primarily reflects changes in interest-bearing deposits
with the Federal Reserve and other central banks, a
net decrease in the securities portfolio and change in

federal funds sold and securities purchased under
resale agreements. In 2021, net cash provided by
investing activities primarily reflects changes in
interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve
and other central banks, partially offset by a net
change in loans and a net increase in the securities
portfolio.

Net cash used for financing activities was $33.7
billion in 2022, compared with $22.0 billion in 2021.
In 2022 and 2021, net cash used for financing
activities primarily reflects changes in deposits and
repayments of long-term debt, partially offset by
issuances of long-term debt. In 2021, net cash used
for financing activities also reflects common stock
repurchases.

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation total
shareholders’ equity decreased to $40.7 billion at
Dec. 31, 2022 from $43.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2021.
The decrease primarily reflects unrealized losses on
securities available-for-sale, dividend payments and
foreign currency translation, partially offset by
earnings.

The unrealized loss (after-tax) on our available-for-
sale securities portfolio, net of hedges, included in
accumulated other comprehensive income was $2.4
billion at Dec. 31, 2022, compared with an unrealized

gain (after-tax), net of hedges, of $362 million at Dec.

31, 2021. The increase in the unrealized loss, net of
tax, was primarily driven by higher market interest
rates.

40 BNY Mellon

We repurchased 2.0 million common shares at an
average price of $61.08 per common share for a total
of $124 million in 2022.

In June 2021, our Board of Directors authorized the
repurchase of up to $6.0 billion of common shares
over the six quarters beginning in the third quarter of
2021 and continuing through the fourth quarter of
2022.

In January 2023, we announced a share repurchase
program approved by our Board of Directors
providing for the repurchase of up to $5.0 billion of
common shares beginning Jan. 1, 2023. This new
share repurchase plan replaced all previously
authorized share repurchase plans.

Results of Operations (continued)

In July 2022, our Board of Directors approved a 9%
increase in the quarterly cash dividend on common
stock, from $0.34 to $0.37 per share. We began
paying the increased quarterly cash dividend in the
third quarter of 2022.

Capital adequacy

Regulators establish certain levels of capital for bank
holding companies (“BHCs”) and banks, including
BNY Mellon and our bank subsidiaries, in
accordance with established quantitative
measurements. For the Parent to maintain its status
as a financial holding company (“FHC”), our U.S.
bank subsidiaries and BNY Mellon must, among

other things, qualify as “well capitalized.” As of Dec.

31, 2022 and Dec. 31, 2021, BNY Mellon and our
U.S. bank subsidiaries were “well capitalized.”
Failure to satisfy regulatory standards, including

“well capitalized” status or capital adequacy rules

Results of Operations (continued)

Our CET1 ratio determined under the Advanced
Approaches was 11.2% at Dec. 31, 2022 and 11.2%
at Dec. 31, 2021 under the Standardized Approach.
The unchanged ratio primarily reflects capital
generated through earnings, lower RWAs and the
impact of the Alcentra sale, offset by the net decrease
in accumulated other comprehensive income and
capital deployed through dividends.

In 2022, we implemented the Standardized Approach
for Counterparty Credit Risk (“SA-CCR”), which
replaced the current exposure method used to
measure derivative counterparty exposure.

The Tier 1 leverage ratio was 5.8% at Dec. 31, 2022,
compared with 5.5% at Dec. 31, 2021. The increase
was driven by lower average assets, partially offset by
a decrease in capital.

Risk-based capital ratios vary depending on the size
of the balance sheet at period-end and the levels and
types of investments in assets, and leverage ratios
vary based on the average size of the balance sheet
over the quarter. The balance sheet size fluctuates
from period to period based on levels of customer and
market activity. In general, when servicing clients
are more actively trading securities, deposit balances
and the balance sheet as a whole are higher. In
addition, when markets experience significant
volatility or stress, our balance sheet size may
increase considerably as client deposit levels increase.

Our capital ratios are necessarily subject to, among
other things, anticipated compliance with all
necessary enhancements to model calibration,
approval by regulators of certain models used as part
of RWA calculations, other refinements, further
implementation guidance from regulators, market
practices and standards and any changes BNY Mellon
may make to its businesses. As a consequence of
these factors, our capital ratios may materially
change, and may be volatile over time and from
period to period.

Under the Advanced Approaches, our operational loss

risk model is informed by external losses, including
fines and penalties levied against institutions in the

42 BNY Mellon

financial services industry, particularly those that
relate to businesses in which we operate, and as a
result external losses have impacted and could in the
future impact the amount of capital that we are
required to hold.

Stress capital buffer

In August 2022, the Federal Reserve announced that
BNY Mellon’s SCB requirement would be 2.5%,
equal to the regulatory floor, effective as of Oct. 1,
2022. The SCB replaced the static 2.5% capital
conservation buffer for Standardized Approach
capital ratios for Comprehensive Capital Analysis and
Review (“CCAR”) BHCs. The SCB does not apply
to bank subsidiaries, which remain subject to the
static 2.5% capital conservation buffer. See
“Supervision and Regulation” for additional
information.

The SCB final rule generally eliminates the
requirement for prior approval of common stock
repurchases in excess of the distributions in a firm’s
capital plan, provided that such distributions are
consistent with applicable capital requirements and
buffers, including the SCB.

Trading activities and risk management

Our trading activities are focused on acting as a
market-maker for our customers, facilitating customer
trades and risk-mitigating hedging in compliance with
the Volcker Rule. The risk from market-making
activities for customers is managed by our traders and
limited in total exposure through a system of position
limits, value-at-risk (“VaR”) methodology and other
market sensitivity measures. VaR is the potential loss
in value due to adverse market movements over a
defined time horizon with a specified confidence
level. The calculation of our VaR used by
management and presented below assumes a one-day
holding period, utilizes a 99% confidence level and
incorporates non-linear product characteristics. VaR
facilitates comparisons across portfolios of different
risk characteristics. VaR also captures the
diversification of aggregated risk at the firm-wide
level.

VaR represents a key risk management measure and
it is important to note the inherent limitations to VaR,
which include:

* VaR does not estimate potential losses over longer
time horizons where moves may be extreme;

* VaR does not take account of potential variability
of market liquidity; and

* Previous moves in market risk factors may not
produce accurate predictions of all future market
moves.

See Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information on the VaR
methodology.

The following tables indicate the calculated VaR
amounts for the trading portfolio for the designated

N/M — Because the minimum and maximum may occur on different

effect.

The interest rate component of VaR represents
instruments whose values are predominantly driven
by interest rate levels. These instruments include, but
are not limited to, U.S. Treasury securities, swaps,
swaptions, forward rate agreements, exchange-traded
futures and options, and other interest rate derivative
products.

The foreign exchange component of VaR represents
instruments whose values predominantly vary with
the level or volatility of currency exchange rates or
interest rates. These instruments include, but are not
limited to, currency balances, spot and forward
transactions, currency options and other currency
derivative products.

The equity component of VaR consists of instruments
that represent an ownership interest in the form of
domestic and foreign common stock or other equity-
linked instruments. These instruments include, but
are not limited to, common stock, exchange-traded
funds, preferred stock, listed equity options (puts and
calls), OTC equity options, equity total return swaps,
equity index futures and other equity derivative
products.

The credit component of VaR represents instruments
whose values are predominantly driven by credit
spread levels, 1.¢e., idiosyncratic default risk. These
instruments include, but are not limited to, single
issuer credit default swaps, and securities with
exposures from corporate and municipal credit
spreads.

The diversification component of VaR is the risk
reduction benefit that occurs when combining
portfolios and offsetting positions, and from the
correlated behavior of risk factor movements.

Trading assets include debt and equity instruments
and derivative assets, primarily foreign exchange and
interest rate contracts, not designated as hedging
instruments. Trading assets were $9.9 billion at Dec.
31, 2022 and $16.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2021.

Trading liabilities include debt and equity instruments
and derivative liabilities, primarily foreign exchange
and interest rate contracts, not designated as hedging
instruments. Trading liabilities were $5.4 billion at
Dec. 31, 2022 and $5.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2021.

Under our fair value methodology for derivative
contracts, an initial “risk-neutral” valuation is
performed on each position assuming time-
discounting based on a AA credit curve. In addition,
we consider credit risk in arriving at the fair value of
our derivatives.

We reflect external credit ratings as well as
observable credit default swap spreads for both

46 BNY Mellon

ourselves and our counterparties when measuring the
fair value of our derivative positions. Accordingly,
the valuation of our derivative positions is sensitive to
the current changes in our own credit spreads, as well
as those of our counterparties.

At Dec. 31, 2022, our OTC derivative assets,
including those in hedging relationships, of $2.9
billion included a credit valuation adjustment
(“CVA”) deduction of $18 million. Our OTC
derivative liabilities, including those in hedging
relationships, of $3.0 billion included a debit
valuation adjustment (“DVA”) of $6 million related
to our own credit spread. Net of hedges, the CVA
increased by $4 million and the DVA increased by $7
million in 2022, which increased other trading
revenue by $3 million in 2022. During 2022, no
realized loss was charged off against CVA reserves.

At Dec. 31, 2021, our OTC derivative assets,
including those in hedging relationships, of $2.8
billion included a CVA deduction of $29 million.

Our OTC derivative liabilities, including those in
hedging relationships, of $3.4 billion included a DVA
of $2 million related to our own credit spread. Net of
hedges, the CVA increased by $1 million and the
DVA was unchanged in 2021, which decreased
investment and other revenue - other trading revenue
by $1 million in 2021. During 2021, no realized loss
was charged off against CVA reserves.

Asset/liability management

Our diversified business activities include processing
securities, accepting deposits, investing in securities,
lending, raising money as needed to fund assets and
other transactions. The market risks from these
activities include interest rate risk and foreign
exchange risk. Our primary market risk is exposure
to movements in U.S. dollar interest rates and certain
foreign currency interest rates. We actively manage
interest rate sensitivity and use earnings simulation
and discounted cash flow models to identify interest
rate exposures.

An earnings simulation model is the primary tool
used to assess changes in pre-tax net interest revenue
between a baseline scenario and hypothetical interest
rate scenarios. Interest rate sensitivity is quantified
by calculating the change in pre-tax net interest
revenue between the scenarios over a 12-month
measurement period.

The baseline scenario incorporates the market’s
forward rate expectations and management’s
assumptions regarding client deposit rates, credit
spreads, changes in the prepayment behavior of loans
and securities and the impact of derivative financial
instruments used for interest rate risk management
purposes as of Dec. 31, 2022. These assumptions
have been developed through a combination of
historical analysis and future expected pricing
behavior and are inherently uncertain. Actual results
may differ materially from projected results due to
timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate
changes, and changes in market conditions and
management’s strategies, among other factors. Client
deposit levels and mix are key assumptions impacting
net interest revenue in the baseline as well as the
hypothetical interest rate scenarios. The earnings
simulation model assumes static deposit levels and
mix and it also assumes that no management actions
will be taken to mitigate the effects of interest rate
changes. Typically, the baseline scenario uses the
average deposit balances of the quarter.

In the table below, we use the earnings simulation
model to assess the impact of various hypothetical
interest rate scenarios compared to the baseline
scenario. In each of the scenarios, all currencies’
interest rates are instantaneously shifted higher or
lower at the start of the forecast. Long-term interest
rates are defined as all tenors equal to or greater than
three years and short-term interest rates are defined as

all tenors equal to or less than three months. Interim
term points are interpolated where applicable.

The following table shows net interest revenue
sensitivity for BNY Mellon.

Estimated changes in net

interest revenue Dec. 31, Sept. 30, Dec. 31,
(in millions) 2022 2022 2021
Up 100 bps rate shock vs.

baseline $ 214 $ 267 $ 688
Long-term up 100 bps, short-

term unchanged 30 (17) 204
Short-term up 100 bps, long-

term unchanged 184 283 483
Long-term down 50 bps, short-

term unchanged (20) 7 (98)
Down 100 bp rate shock vs.

The declines in most of the rising rate sensitivities
compared with Sept. 30, 2022 are due to higher
deposit interest expense in rising rate scenarios,
which is driven by the expectation of paying higher
rates on deposits as central banks continue their
tightening cycle.

While the net interest revenue sensitivity scenario
calculations assume static deposit balances to
facilitate consistent period-over-period comparisons,
net interest revenue is impacted by changes in deposit
balances. Noninterest-bearing deposits are
particularly sensitive to changes in short-term rates.

To illustrate the net interest revenue sensitivity to
deposit run-off, we note that a $5 billion
instantaneous reduction of U.S. dollar-denominated
noninterest-bearing deposits would reduce the net
interest revenue sensitivity results in the up 100 basis
point scenario in the table above by approximately
$290 million. The impact would be smaller if the
run-off was assumed to be a mixture of interest-
bearing and noninterest-bearing deposits.

For a discussion of factors impacting the growth or
contraction of deposits, see “Risk Factors — Capital
and Liquidity Risk — Our business, financial
condition and results of operations could be adversely
affected if we do not effectively manage our
liquidity.”

We also project future cash flows from our assets and
liabilities over a long-term horizon and then discount
these cash flows using instantaneous parallel shocks

to prevailing interest rates. This measure reflects the

BNY Mellon 47

Results of Operations (continued)

structural balance sheet interest rate sensitivity by
discounting all future cash flows. The aggregation of
these discounted cash flows is the economic value of
equity (“EVE”). The following table shows how
EVE would change in response to changes in interest
rates.

Estimated changes in EVE Dec. 31,
2022
Rate change:
Up 200 bps vs. baseline (1.8)%
Up 100 bps vs. baseline 2.2%

The asymmetrical accounting treatment of the impact
of a change in interest rates on our balance sheet may
create a situation in which an increase in interest rates
can adversely affect reported equity and regulatory
capital, even though economically there may be no
impact on our economic capital position. For
example, an increase in rates will result in a decline in
the value of our available-for-sale securities portfolio.
In this example, there is no corresponding change on
our fixed liabilities, even though economically these
liabilities are more valuable as rates rise.

These results do not reflect strategies that
management could employ to limit the impact as
interest rate expectations change.

To manage foreign exchange risk, we fund foreign
currency-denominated assets with liability
instruments denominated in the same currency. We
utilize various foreign exchange contracts if a liability
denominated in the same currency is not available or
desired, and to minimize the earnings impact of
translation gains or losses created by investments in
foreign markets. We use forward foreign exchange
contracts to protect the value of our net investment in
foreign operations. At Dec. 31, 2022, net investments
in foreign operations totaled $13 billion and were
spread across 18 foreign currencies.
