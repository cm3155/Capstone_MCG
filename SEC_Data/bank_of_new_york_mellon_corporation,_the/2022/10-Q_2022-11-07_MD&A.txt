first company listed on the New York Stock Exchange
(NYSE: BK). With a history of more than 235 years, BNY
Mellon is a global company dedicated to helping its clients

The diagram below presents our three business segments
and lines of business, with the remaining operations in the
Other segment.

Key third quarter 2022 and subsequent events

Alcentra

On Nov. 1, 2022, we completed the sale of BNY Alcentra
Group Holdings, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries,
“Alcentra”). At Sept. 30, 2022, Alcentra had $32 billion in
AUM concentrated in senior secured loans, high yield
bonds, private credit, structured credit, special situations
and multi-strategy credit strategies.

Leadership succession

In July 2022, we announced that Dermot McDonogh was
appointed to the position of Chief Financial Officer
(“CFO”), effective Feb. 1, 2023, succeeding Emily
Portney, who has served in that role since July 19, 2020.
Mr. McDonogh joined BNY Mellon on Nov. 1, 2022. Ms.
Portney will continue serving as CFO through Jan. 31,
2023, at which time she will assume a new position leading
the Company’s Treasury Services, Credit Services and
Clearance & Collateral Management businesses.

Mr. McDonogh most recently served as the chief operating
officer of the Europe, Middle East and Africa region for
Goldman Sachs International and as the chief executive
officer of Goldman Sachs International Bank since 2015.

Increase in cash dividend on common stock

In July, our Board of Directors approved a 9% increase in
the quarterly cash dividend on common stock, from $0.34
to $0.37 per share.

Goodwill impairment

In the third quarter of 2022, we recorded a $680 million
impairment of the goodwill associated with the Investment
Management reporting unit, which was driven by lower
market values and a higher discount rate. This goodwill
impairment represents a non-cash charge and did not affect
BNY Mellon’s liquidity position, tangible common equity
or regulatory capital ratios. See “Critical accounting
estimates” for additional information.

Highlights of third quarter 2022 results

Net income applicable to common shareholders was $319
million, or $0.39 per diluted common share, in the third
quarter of 2022, including the impact of notable items.
Notable items in the third quarter of 2022 include goodwill
impairment in the Investment Management reporting unit,
a disposal gain (reflected in investment and other revenue),
severance expense and litigation reserves. Excluding
notable items, net income applicable to common
shareholders was $983 million (Non-GAAP), or $1.21
(Non-GAAP) per diluted common share, in the third
quarter of 2022. Net income applicable to common
shareholders was $881 million, or $1.04 per diluted
common share, in the third quarter of 2021, including the
impact of notable items. Notable items in the third quarter
of 2021 include litigation reserves, gains on disposals
(reflected in investment and other revenue) and severance
expense. Excluding notable items, net income applicable to
common shareholders was $926 million (Non-GAAP), or
$1.09 (Non-GAAP) per diluted common share, in the third
quarter of 2021.

The highlights below are based on the third quarter of 2022
compared with the third quarter of 2021, unless otherwise
noted.

• Total revenue of $4.3 billion increased 6%, primarily

reflecting:
• Fee and other revenue decreased 1%, primarily

reflecting:
• Fee revenue decreased 1%, primarily reflecting

lower market values, the unfavorable impact of a
stronger U.S. dollar, the impact of lost business in
the prior year in both Pershing and Corporate
Trust and an unfavorable change in the mix of
AUM, partially offset by lower money market fee
waivers and higher client activity. (See “Fee and
other revenue” beginning on page 7.)
Investment and other revenue decreased primarily
reflecting strategic equity investment gains
recorded in the third quarter of 2021, partially
offset by higher other trading revenue and higher
disposal gains. (See “Fee and other revenue”
beginning on page 7.)

•

• Net interest revenue increased 44%, primarily

reflecting higher interest rates on interest-earning
assets, partially offset by higher funding expense and
lower interest-earning assets. (See “Net interest
revenue” on page 11.)

• Provision for credit losses was a benefit of $30 million,
primarily reflecting reserve releases related to cash
balances with exposure to Russia and a modest benefit
from our commercial real estate portfolio. (See
“Consolidated balance sheet review – Allowance for
credit losses” beginning on page 31.)

• Noninterest expense increased 26%, primarily reflecting
the goodwill impairment in the Investment Management
reporting unit. Excluding notable items, noninterest
expense increased 4% (Non-GAAP), primarily
reflecting higher investments in growth, infrastructure
and efficiency initiatives and higher revenue-related
expenses, as well as the impact of inflation, partially
offset by the favorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar.
(See “Noninterest expense” on page 14.)

• Effective tax rate of 38.4% or 19.5% (Non-GAAP)
excluding notable items, primarily the goodwill
impairment. (See “Income taxes” on page 14.)

• Return on common equity (“ROE”) was 3.5% for the
third quarter of 2022. Excluding notable items, the
adjusted ROE was 10.9% (Non-GAAP) for the third
quarter of 2022.

BNY Mellon 5

• Return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) was
7.5% (Non-GAAP) for the third quarter of 2022.
Excluding notable items, the adjusted ROTCE was
22.4% (Non-GAAP) for the third quarter of 2022.

See “Supplemental information – Explanation of GAAP
and Non-GAAP financial measures” beginning on page 45
for a reconciliation of these Non-GAAP measures.

Metrics

• AUC/A of $42.2 trillion decreased 7%, primarily

reflecting lower market values and the unfavorable
impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, partially offset by
client inflows and net new business.

• AUM of $1.8 trillion decreased 23%, primarily

reflecting lower market values and the unfavorable
impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, partially offset by net
inflows.

Capital and liquidity

• Our CET1 ratio calculated under the Standardized

Approach was 10.0% at Sept. 30, 2022 and 10.0% at
June 30, 2022 under the Advanced Approaches, as
unrealized losses on securities available-for-sale,
foreign currency translation and capital deployed
through dividends were offset by capital generated
through earnings and lower risk-weighted assets
(“RWA”). (See “Capital” beginning on page 37.)

• Tier 1 leverage was 5.4% at Sept. 30, 2022, compared

with 5.2% at June 30, 2022. The increase was driven by
lower average assets,

partially offset by the decrease in capital. (See “Capital”
beginning on page 37.)

• Dividends to common shareholders were $303 million

(including dividend-equivalents on share-based
awards).

N/M – Not meaningful.

Fee revenue decreased 1% compared with the third quarter
of 2021 and 3% compared with the second quarter of 2022.
The decrease compared with the third quarter of 2021
primarily reflects lower investment management and
performance fees, partially offset by higher investment
services fees and foreign exchange revenue. The decrease
compared with the second quarter of 2022 primarily
reflects lower investment services fees, investment
management and performance fees and foreign exchange
revenue.

Investment and other revenue decreased $12 million
compared with the third quarter of 2021 and increased $26
million compared with the second quarter of 2022. The
decrease compared with the third quarter of 2021 primarily
reflects strategic equity investment gains recorded in the
third quarter of 2021, partially offset by higher other
trading revenue and higher disposal gains. The increase
compared with the second quarter of 2022 primarily
reflects a gain on disposal, higher other trading revenue
and improved seed capital results, partially

offset by strategic equity investment gains recorded in the
second quarter of 2022.

Money market fee waivers

In recent periods, low short-term interest rates resulted in
money market mutual fund fees and other similar fees
being waived to protect investors from negative returns.
The fee waivers impacted fee revenues in most of our
businesses, but also resulted in lower distribution and
servicing expense. Money market fee waivers are highly
sensitive to changes in short-term interest rates and are
difficult to predict.

The following table presents the impact of money market
fee waivers on our consolidated fee revenue, net of
distribution and servicing expense. In the third quarter of
2022, the net impact of money market fee waivers was $22
million, down from $66 million in the second quarter of
2022, driven by higher interest rates.

(a)    The line of business revenue for management reporting purposes reflects the impact of revenue transferred between the businesses.

Investment services fees

Investment services fees increased 3% compared with the
third quarter of 2021 and decreased 2% compared with the
second quarter of 2022. The increase compared with the
third quarter of 2021 primarily reflects lower money
market fee waivers and higher client activity, partially
offset by lower market values, the impact of lost business
in the prior year in Pershing and Corporate Trust and the
unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. The decrease
compared with the second quarter of 2022 primarily
reflects lower depositary receipts revenue, lower market
values, and the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S.
dollar, partially offset by lower money market fee waivers.

AUC/A totaled $42.2 trillion at Sept. 30, 2022, a decrease
of 7% compared with Sept. 30, 2021, primarily reflecting
lower market values and the unfavorable impact of a
stronger U.S. dollar, partially offset by client inflows and
net new business.
AUC/A consisted of 33% equity securities and 67% fixed
income securities at Sept. 30, 2022, and 37% equity
securities and 63% fixed income securities at Sept. 30,
2021.

See “Securities Services business segment” and “Market
and Wealth Services business segment” in “Review of
business segments” for additional details.

Investment management and performance fees

Investment management and performance fees decreased
12% compared with the third quarter of 2021 and 4%
compared with the second quarter of 2022. The decrease
compared with the third quarter of 2021 primarily reflects
lower market values, the unfavorable impact of a stronger
U.S. dollar, an unfavorable change in the mix of AUM and
lower equity income, partially offset by lower money
market fee waivers. The decrease compared with the
second quarter of 2022 primarily reflects lower market
values, the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar
and lower equity income, partially offset by lower money
market fee waivers. Performance fees were $10 million in
the third quarter of 2022, $21 million in the third quarter of
2021 and $5 million in the second quarter of 2022. On a
constant currency basis (Non-GAAP), investment
management and performance fees decreased 8%
compared with the third quarter of 2021. See
“Supplemental information – Explanation of GAAP and
Non-GAAP financial measures” beginning on page 45 for
the reconciliation of Non-GAAP measures.

8 BNY Mellon

AUM was $1.8 trillion at Sept. 30, 2022, a decrease of
23% compared with Sept. 30, 2021, primarily reflecting
lower market values and the unfavorable impact of a
stronger U.S. dollar, partially offset by net inflows.

See “Investment and Wealth Management business
segment” in “Review of business segments” for additional
details regarding the drivers of investment management
and performance fees, AUM and AUM flows.

Foreign exchange revenue

Foreign exchange revenue is primarily driven by the
volume of client transactions and the spread realized on
these transactions, both of which are impacted by market
volatility, the impact of foreign currency hedging activities
and foreign currency remeasurement gain (loss). Foreign
exchange revenue increased 10% compared with the third
quarter of 2021 and decreased 9% compared with the
second quarter of 2022. The increase compared with the
third quarter of 2021 primarily reflects higher volatility.
The decrease compared with the second quarter of 2022
reflects lower volumes, partially offset by higher volatility.
Foreign exchange revenue is primarily reported in the
Securities Services business segment and, to a lesser
extent, in the Market and Wealth Services and Investment
and Wealth Management business segments and the Other
segment.

Investment and other revenue

Investment and other revenue includes income or loss from
consolidated investment management funds, seed capital
gains or losses, other trading revenue or loss, renewable
energy investments losses, income from corporate and
bank-owned life insurance contracts, other investment
gains or losses, gains or losses from disposals, expense
reimbursements from our CIBC Mellon joint venture, other
income or loss and net securities gains or losses. The
income or loss from consolidated investment management
funds should be considered together with the net income or
loss attributable to noncontrolling interests, which reflects
the portion of the consolidated funds for which we do not
have an economic interest and is reflected below net
income as a separate line item on the consolidated income
statement. Other trading revenue or loss primarily includes
the impact of market-risk hedging activity related to our
seed capital investments in investment management funds,
non-foreign currency derivative and fixed income trading,
and other hedging activity. Investments in renewable
energy generate losses in investment and other revenue that
are more than offset by benefits and credits recorded to the
provision for income taxes. Other investment gains or
losses includes fair value changes of non-readily
marketable equity securities, private equity and other
investments. Expense reimbursements from our CIBC
Mellon joint venture relate to expenses incurred by BNY
Mellon on behalf of the CIBC Mellon joint venture. Other
income or loss includes various miscellaneous revenues.

Investment and other revenue was $117 million in the third
quarter of 2022 compared with $129 million in the third
quarter of 2021 and $91 million in the second quarter of
2022. The decrease compared with the third quarter of
2021 primarily reflects strategic equity investment gains
recorded in the third quarter of 2021, partially offset by
higher other trading revenue and higher disposal gains. The
increase compared with the second quarter of 2022
primarily reflects a gain on disposal, higher other trading
revenue and improved seed capital results, partially offset
by strategic equity investment gains recorded in the second
quarter of 2022.

Year-to-date 2022 compared with year-to-date 2021

Fee revenue decreased slightly compared with the first nine
months of 2021, primarily reflecting lower investment
management and performance fees, partially offset by
higher investment services fees and foreign exchange
revenue. The 7% decrease in investment management and
performance fees

primarily reflects the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S.
dollar, lower market values, an unfavorable change in the
mix of AUM and lower equity income,
partially offset by lower money market fee waivers. The
2% increase in investment services fees primarily reflects
lower money market fee waivers and higher client activity,
partially offset by the impact of lost business in the prior
year in Pershing and Corporate Trust and the accelerated
amortization of deferred costs for depositary receipts
services related to Russia recorded in the first quarter of
2022. The 5% increase in foreign exchange revenue
primarily reflects higher volatility.

Investment and other revenue increased $49 million
compared with the first nine months of 2021, primarily
reflecting higher strategic equity investment gains and
other trading revenue, a $39 million impairment for a
renewable energy investment recorded in the first quarter
of 2021 and higher disposal gains, partially offset by lower
seed capital results.

which allows for comparisons of amounts arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practice. The adjustment to
an FTE basis has no impact on net income.

N/M – Not meaningful.
bps – basis points.

Net interest revenue increased 44% compared with the
third quarter of 2021 and 12% compared with the second
quarter of 2022. The increase compared with the third
quarter of 2021 primarily reflects higher interest rates on
interest-earning assets, partially offset by higher funding
expense and lower interest-earning assets. The increase
compared with the second quarter of 2022 primarily
reflects higher interest rates on interest-earning assets,
partially offset by higher funding expense.

Net interest margin increased 38 basis points compared
with the third quarter of 2021 and 16 basis points
compared with the second quarter of 2022. The changes
compared with the third quarter of 2021 and the second
quarter of 2022 primarily reflect the factors mentioned
above.

Average interest-earning assets decreased 8% compared
with the third quarter of 2021 and 5% compared with the
second quarter of 2022. The decrease compared with the
third quarter of 2021 primarily reflects lower interest-
bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central
banks, securities and federal funds sold and securities
purchased under resale agreements balances. The decrease
was partially offset by larger loan balances. The decrease
compared with the second quarter of 2022 primarily
reflects lower interest-bearing deposits with the Federal
Reserve and other central banks and securities balances.

Average non-U.S. dollar deposits comprised approximately
25% of our average total deposits in the third quarter of
2022. Approximately 40% of the average non-U.S. dollar
deposits in the third quarter of 2022 were euro-
denominated.

Year-to-date 2022 compared with year-to-date 2021

Net interest revenue increased 26% compared with the first
nine months of 2021, primarily driven by higher interest
rates on interest-earning assets and a change in asset mix,
partially offset by higher funding expense and lower
interest-earning assets. The increase in the net interest
margin primarily reflects the factors mentioned above.

Average interest-earning assets decreased 6% compared
with the first nine months of 2021. The decrease primarily
reflects lower interest-bearing deposits with the Federal
Reserve and other central banks, securities, interest-bearing
deposits with banks and federal funds sold and securities
purchased under resale agreements balances. The decrease
was partially offset by larger loan balances.

Income taxes

BNY Mellon recorded an income tax provision of $242
million in the third quarter of 2022. The effective tax rate
was 38.4% in the third quarter of 2022, or 19.5% (Non-
GAAP) excluding notable items, primarily goodwill
impairment. The income tax provision was $219 million
(18.8% effective tax rate) in the third quarter of 2021 and
$231 million (21.1% effective tax rate) in the second
quarter of 2022. See “Supplemental information –
Explanation of GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures”
beginning on page 45 for the reconciliation of this Non-
GAAP measure. For additional information, see Note 11 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Review of business segments

We have an internal information system that produces
performance data along product and service lines for our
three principal business segments: Securities Services,
Market and Wealth Services and Investment and Wealth
Management, and the Other segment.

Business segment accounting principles

Our business data has been determined on an internal
management basis of accounting, rather than the generally
accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) used for
consolidated financial reporting. These measurement
principles are designed so that reported results of the
businesses will track their economic performance.

For information on the accounting principles of our
businesses, see Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements. For information on the primary
products and services in each line of business, the primary
types of revenue by line of business and how our business
segments are presented and analyzed, see Note 24 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2021
Annual Report.

Business segment results are subject to reclassification
when organizational changes are made, or for refinements
in revenue and expense allocation methodologies.
Refinements are typically reflected on a prospective basis.
There were no reclassification or organizational changes in
the third quarter of 2022.

The results of our business segments may be influenced by
client and other activities that vary by quarter. In the first
quarter, staff expense typically increases, reflecting the
vesting of long-term stock awards for retirement-eligible
employees. Prior to 2022, in the third quarter, staff expense
typically increased, reflecting the annual employee merit
increase. In 2022, this increase was reflected in the second
quarter.

Securities Services business segment

In the third quarter, volume-related fees may decline due to
reduced client activity. In the fourth quarter, we typically
incur higher business development and marketing
expenses. In our Investment and Wealth Management
business segment, performance fees are typically higher in
the fourth and first quarters, as those quarters represent the
end of the measurement period for many of the
performance fee-eligible relationships.

The results of our business segments may also be impacted
by the translation of financial results denominated in
foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar. We are primarily
impacted by activities denominated in the British pound
and the euro. On a consolidated basis and in our Securities
Services and Market and Wealth Services business
segments, we typically have more foreign currency-
denominated expenses than revenues. However, our
Investment and Wealth Management business segment
typically has more foreign currency-denominated revenues
than expenses. Overall, currency fluctuations impact the
year-over-year growth rate in the Investment and Wealth
Management business segment more than the Securities
Services and Market and Wealth Services business
segments. However, currency fluctuations, in isolation, are
not expected to significantly impact net income on a
consolidated basis.

Fee revenue in the Investment and Wealth Management
business segment, and, to a lesser extent, the Securities
Services and Market and Wealth Services business
segments, is impacted by the global market fluctuations. At
Sept. 30, 2022, we estimated that a 5% change in global
equity markets, spread evenly throughout the year, would
impact fee revenue by less than 1% and diluted earnings
per common share by $0.04 to $0.07.

See Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for the consolidating schedules, which show the
contribution of our business segments to our overall
profitability.

Review of financial results

AUC/A of $30.0 trillion decreased 11% compared with
Sept. 30, 2021, primarily reflecting lower market values
and the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar,
partially offset by client inflows and net new business.

Total revenue of $2.1 billion increased 13% compared
with the third quarter of 2021 and 3% compared with the
second quarter of 2022. The drivers of total revenue by
line of business are indicated below.

Asset Servicing revenue of $1.6 billion increased 11%
compared with the third quarter of 2021 and 4%
compared with the second quarter of 2022. The increase
compared with the third quarter of 2021 primarily
reflects higher net interest revenue and lower money
market fee waivers, partially offset by lower market
values. The increase compared with the second quarter of
2022 primarily reflects higher net interest revenue and a
disposal gain, partially offset by lower market values and
the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar.

Issuer Services revenue of $478 million increased 20%
compared with the third quarter of 2021 and 1%
compared with the second quarter of 2022. The increase
compared with the third quarter of 2021 primarily
reflects higher net interest revenue and lower money
market fee waivers, partially offset by the impact of lost
business in the prior year in Corporate Trust and lower
Depositary Receipts revenue. The increase compared
with the second quarter of 2022 primarily reflects higher
net interest revenue in Corporate Trust, partially offset by
lower Depositary Receipts revenue.

Market and regulatory trends are driving investable
assets toward lower fee asset management products at
reduced margins for our clients. These dynamics are also
negatively impacting our investment services fees.
However, at the same time, these trends are providing
additional outsourcing opportunities as clients and other
market participants seek to comply with regulations and
reduce their operating costs.

Noninterest expense of $1.6 billion increased 1%
compared with the third quarter of 2021 and decreased
6% compared with the second quarter of 2022. The
increase compared with the third quarter of 2021
primarily reflects higher investments in growth,
infrastructure and efficiency initiatives, as well as the
impact of inflation, partially offset by lower litigation
reserves and the favorable impact of a stronger U.S.
dollar. The decrease compared with the second quarter of
2022 primarily reflects lower litigation reserves.

Year-to-date 2022 compared with year-to-date 2021

Total revenue of $5.9 billion increased 8% compared with
the first nine months of 2021. Asset Servicing revenue of
$4.6 billion increased 9%, primarily reflecting higher net
interest revenue, lower money market fee waivers, higher
client activity and a disposal gain, partially offset by the
unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. Issuer
Services revenue of $1.2 billion increased 4%, primarily
reflecting higher net interest revenue and lower money
market fee waivers in Corporate Trust, partially offset by
accelerated amortization of deferred costs for depositary
receipts services related to Russia recorded in the first
quarter of 2022 and the impact of lost business in the prior
year in Corporate Trust.

Business segment description

The Market and Wealth Services business segment consists
of three distinct lines of business, Pershing, Treasury
Services and Clearance and Collateral Management, which
provide business services and technology solutions to
entities including financial institutions, corporations,
foundations and endowments, public funds and
government agencies. For information on the drivers of the
Market and Wealth Services fee revenue, see Note 10 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2021
Annual Report.

and technology solutions, delivering operational support to
broker-dealers, wealth managers and registered investment
advisors (“RIAs”) globally.

Our Treasury Services business is a leading provider of

services for financial institutions, corporations and the
public sector.

Our Clearance and Collateral Management business
clears and settles equity and fixed income transactions

U.S. government securities clearance and a provider of

tri-party collateral management services with an average
of $5.5 trillion serviced globally, including
approximately $4.4 trillion of the U.S. tri-party repo

drivers of total revenue by line of business are indicated
below.

Pershing revenue of $658 million increased 16% compared
with the third quarter of 2021 and 3% compared with the
second quarter of 2022. The increase compared with the
third quarter of 2021 primarily reflects lower money
market fee waivers and higher client activity, partially
offset by the impact of prior year lost business. The
increase compared with the second quarter of 2022
primarily reflects lower money market fee waivers.

Treasury Services revenue of $390 million increased 20%
compared with the third quarter of 2021 and 5% compared
with the second quarter of 2022. The increase compared
with the third quarter of 2021 primarily reflects higher net
interest revenue and lower money market fee waivers. The
increase compared with the second quarter of 2022
primarily reflects higher net interest revenue.

Clearance and Collateral Management revenue of $319
million increased 14% compared with the third quarter of
2021 and 5% compared with the second quarter of 2022.
The increase compared with the third quarter of 2021
primarily reflects higher net interest revenue and clearance
volumes. The increase compared with the second quarter of
2022 primarily reflects higher net interest revenue.

Noninterest expense of $737 million increased 10%
compared with the third quarter of 2021 and 5% compared
with the second quarter of 2022. The increase compared
with the third quarter of 2021 primarily reflects higher
investments in growth, infrastructure and efficiency
initiatives, as well as the impact of inflation, partially offset
by the favorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. The
increase compared with the second quarter of 2022
primarily reflects higher staff expense.

Business segment description

Review of financial results

Our Investment and Wealth Management business segment
consists of two distinct lines of business, Investment
Management and Wealth Management. Our investment
firms deliver a highly diversified portfolio of investment
strategies independently, and through our global
distribution network, to institutional and retail clients
globally. BNY Mellon Wealth Management provides
investment management, custody, wealth and estate
planning, private banking services, investment servicing
and information management. See pages 20 and 21 of our
2021 Annual Report for additional information on our
Investment and Wealth Management business segment.

In May 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell
Alcentra. At Sept. 30, 2022, Alcentra had $32 billion in
AUM concentrated in senior secured loans, high yield
bonds, private credit, structured credit, special situations
and multi-strategy credit strategies. The transaction was
completed on Nov. 1, 2022.

AUM decreased 23% compared with Sept. 30, 2021,
primarily reflecting lower market values and the
unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, partially
offset by net inflows.

Net long-term strategy inflows were $23 billion in the third
quarter of 2022, driven by inflows of liability-driven
investments. Short-term strategy outflows were $2 billion
in the third quarter of 2022. Market and regulatory trends
have resulted in increased demand for lower fee asset
management products and for performance-based fees.

Total revenue of $862 million decreased 16% compared
with the third quarter of 2021 and 4% compared with the
second quarter of 2022. Investment Management revenue
of $579 million decreased 20% compared with the third
quarter of 2021 and 4% compared with the second quarter
of 2022. The decrease compared with the third quarter of
2021 primarily reflects lower market values, the

BNY Mellon 21

unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, an
unfavorable change in the mix of AUM, lower equity
income and strategic equity investment gains recorded in
the third quarter of 2021, partially offset by lower money
market fee waivers. The decrease compared with the
second quarter of 2022 primarily reflects lower market
values, the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar
and lower equity income, partially offset by lower money
market fee waivers.

Wealth Management revenue of $283 million decreased
7% compared with the third quarter of 2021 and 4%
compared with the second quarter of 2022. The decrease
compared with the third quarter of 2021 primarily reflects
lower market values, partially offset by higher net interest
revenue.

Revenue generated in the Investment and Wealth
Management business segment included 33% from non-
U.S. sources in the third quarter of 2022, compared with
38% in the third quarter of 2021 and 35% in the second
quarter of 2022.

Noninterest expense of $1.4 billion increased 96%
compared with the third quarter of 2021 and second quarter
of 2022, primarily reflecting goodwill impairment in the
Investment Management reporting unit. Excluding notable
items, noninterest expense decreased 2% (Non-GAAP)
compared with the third quarter of 2021 and second quarter
of 2022, reflecting the favorable impact of a stronger U.S.
dollar. The decrease compared with the third quarter of
2021 was partially offset by investments in growth
initiatives and higher distribution and servicing expense.
See

“Supplemental information – Explanation of GAAP and
Non-GAAP financial measures” beginning on page 45 for
the reconciliation of this Non-GAAP measure.

Year-to-date 2022 compared with year-to-date 2021

Total revenue of $2.7 billion decreased 10% compared
with the first nine months of 2021. Investment
Management revenue of $1.8 billion decreased 13%,
primarily reflecting the unfavorable impact of a stronger
U.S. dollar, lower seed capital results and market values,
an unfavorable change in the mix of AUM, lower equity
income and strategic equity investment gains recorded in
the third quarter of 2021, partially offset by lower money
market fee waivers. Wealth Management revenue of $885
million decreased 1%, primarily reflecting lower market
values, partially offset by higher net interest revenue.

Noninterest expense of $2.8 billion increased 35%
compared with the first nine months of 2021, primarily
reflecting goodwill impairment in the Investment
Management reporting unit. Excluding notable items,
noninterest expense increased 2% (Non-GAAP) compared
with the first nine months of 2021, primarily reflecting
investments in growth initiatives and higher distribution
and servicing expense, partially offset by the favorable
impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. See “Supplemental
information – Explanation of GAAP and Non-GAAP
financial measures” beginning on page 45 for the

Review of financial results

Total revenue includes corporate treasury and other
investment activity, including hedging activity, which has
an offsetting impact between fee and other revenue and net
interest expense.

Total revenue decreased $21 million compared with the
third quarter of 2021 and $64 million compared with the
second quarter of 2022. The decrease compared with the
second quarter of 2022 primarily reflects strategic equity
gains recorded in the second quarter of 2022.

The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $26 million
in the third quarter of 2022, including reserve releases
related to cash balances with exposure to Russia.

Noninterest expense increased $13 million compared with
the third quarter of 2021 and decreased $34 million
compared with the second quarter of 2022. Both variances
were primarily driven by staff expense.

Year-to-date 2022 compared with year-to-date 2021

Loss before income taxes decreased $39 million compared
with the first nine months of 2021. Total fee and other
revenue increased $88 million, primarily reflecting higher
strategic equity investment gains and a $39 million
impairment for a renewable energy investment recorded in
the first quarter of 2021.

The provision for credit losses was $21 million in the first
nine months of 2022, primarily related to changes in the
macroeconomic forecast and an increase in cash balances
with exposure to Russia.

Noninterest expense increased $19 million compared with
the first nine months of 2021, primarily reflecting higher
staff expense.

Critical accounting estimates

Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our
2021 Annual Report. Our critical accounting estimates are
those related to the allowance for credit losses, goodwill
and other intangibles and litigation and regulatory
contingencies, as referenced below.

“Legal proceedings” in Note 18 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Goodwill and other intangibles

BNY Mellon’s business segments include six reporting
units for which goodwill impairment testing is performed
on an annual basis. As a result of the annual goodwill
impairment test conducted in the second quarter of 2022,
no goodwill impairment was recognized.

An interim test is performed when events or circumstances
occur that may indicate that it is more likely than not that
the fair value of any reporting unit may be less than its
carrying value.

In the third quarter of 2022, due to decreases in market
values and the related outlook as well as increased market
interest rates, we performed an interim goodwill
impairment test of the Investment Management reporting
unit, which had $7.0 billion of allocated goodwill. The fair
value of the Investment Management reporting unit was
determined to be 7% below its carrying value, resulting in
a goodwill impairment charge of $680 million. This
goodwill impairment represents a non-cash charge and did
not affect BNY Mellon’s liquidity position, tangible
common equity or regulatory capital ratios. We determined
it was not necessary to perform an interim goodwill
impairment test for our other reporting units.

We determined the fair value of the Investment
Management reporting unit using an income approach
based on management’s projections as of Sept. 30, 2022.
The discount rate applied to these cash flows was 10.5%
compared with a 10.0% discount rate used in the annual
impairment test conducted in the second quarter of 2022.
The increase was driven by a higher risk free rate.
Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is subject to
uncertainty as it is reliant on estimates of cash flows that
extend far into the future, and, by their nature, are difficult
to estimate over such an extended time frame. The cash
flow estimates for the Investment Management reporting

BNY Mellon 23

unit are impacted by projections of the level and mix of
AUM, market values, operating margins and long-term
growth rates. In the future, changes in the assumptions or
the discount rate could produce a material non-cash
goodwill impairment.

As of Sept. 30, 2022, if the discount rate applied to the
estimated cash flows was increased or decreased by 25
basis points, the fair value of the Investment Management
reporting unit would decrease or increase by 4%,
respectively. Similarly, if the long-term growth rate was
increased or decreased by 10 basis points, the fair value of
the Investment Management reporting unit would increase
or decrease by approximately 1%, respectively.

Consolidated balance sheet review

One of our key risk management objectives is to maintain a
balance sheet that remains strong throughout market cycles
to meet the expectations of our major stakeholders,
including our shareholders, clients, creditors and
regulators.

We also seek to undertake overall liquidity risk, including
intraday liquidity risk, that stays within our risk appetite.
The objective of our balance sheet management strategy is
to maintain a balance sheet that is characterized by strong
liquidity and asset quality, ready access to external funding
sources at competitive rates and a strong capital structure
that supports our risk-taking activities and is adequate to
absorb potential losses. In managing the balance sheet,
appropriate consideration is given to balancing the
competing needs of maintaining sufficient levels of
liquidity and complying with applicable regulations and
supervisory expectations while optimizing profitability.

At Sept. 30, 2022, total assets were $428 billion, compared
with $444 billion at Dec. 31, 2021. The decrease in total
assets was primarily driven by lower securities and federal
funds sold and securities purchased under resale
agreements, partially offset by higher other assets. Deposits
totaled $302 billion at Sept. 30, 2022, compared with $320
billion at Dec. 31, 2021. The decrease reflects lower
interest-bearing deposits in U.S. offices, noninterest-
bearing

24 BNY Mellon

deposits (principally U.S. offices) and interest-bearing
deposits in non-U.S. offices. Total interest-bearing deposits
as a percentage of total interest-earning assets were 59% at
Sept. 30, 2022 and 60% at Dec. 31, 2021.

At Sept. 30, 2022, available funds totaled $150 billion and
included cash and due from banks, interest-bearing
deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central banks,
interest-bearing deposits with banks and federal funds sold
and securities purchased under resale agreements. This
compares with available funds of $155 billion at Dec. 31,
2021. Total available funds as a percentage of total assets
were 35% at Sept. 30, 2022 and Dec. 31, 2021. For
additional information on our available funds, see
“Liquidity and dividends.”

Securities were $144 billion, or 34% of total assets, at
Sept. 30, 2022, compared with $159 billion, or 36% of
total assets, at Dec. 31, 2021. The decrease primarily
reflects unrealized pre-tax losses and lower agency
residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”), partially
offset by higher U.S. Treasury securities. For additional
information on our securities portfolio, see “Securities”
and Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Loans were $70 billion, or 16% of total assets, at Sept. 30,
2022, compared with $68 billion, or 15% of total assets, at
Dec. 31, 2021. The increase was driven by higher loans in
nearly all portfolios, partially offset by lower margin loans.
For additional information on our loan portfolio, see
“Loans” and Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Long-term debt totaled $28 billion at Sept. 30, 2022 and
$26 billion at Dec. 31, 2021. Issuances were partially offset
by redemptions and maturities and a decrease in the fair
value of hedged long-term debt. For additional information
on long-term debt, see “Liquidity and dividends.”

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation total
shareholders’ equity decreased to $40 billion at Sept. 30,
2022 from $43 billion at Dec. 31, 2021. For additional
information, see “Capital.”

Country risk exposure

The following table presents BNY Mellon’s top 10
exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of Sept. 30,
2022, as well as certain countries with higher risk profiles.
The exposure is presented on an internal risk management
basis and has not been reduced by the allowance for credit
losses. We monitor our exposure to these and other
countries as part of our internal country risk management
process.

Country risk exposure at Sept. 30, 2022

Interest-bearing deposits

The country risk exposure below reflects the Company’s
risk to an immediate default of the counterparty or obligor
based on the country of residence of the entity which
incurs the liability. If there is credit risk mitigation, the
country of residence of the entity providing the risk
mitigation is the country of risk. The country of risk for
securities is generally based on the domicile of the issuer
of the security.

Events in recent years have resulted in increased focus on
Brazil. The country risk exposure to Brazil is primarily
short-term trade finance loans extended to large financial
institutions. We also have operations in Brazil providing
investment services and investment management services.

The war in Ukraine has increased our focus on Russia. The
country risk exposure to Russia consists of cash balances
related to our securities services businesses and may
increase in the future to the extent cash is received for the
benefit of our clients that is subject to distribution
restrictions. BNY Mellon has ceased new banking business
in Russia and suspended investment management
purchases of Russian securities. At Sept. 30, 2022, less
than 0.1%

of our AUC/A and less than 0.01% of our AUM consisted
of Russian securities. We will continue to work with
multinational clients that depend on our custody and record
keeping services to manage their exposures.

Securities

In the discussion of our securities portfolio, we have
included certain credit ratings information because the
information can indicate the degree of credit risk to which
we are exposed. Significant changes in ratings
classifications could indicate increased credit risk for us
and could be accompanied by an increase in the allowance
for credit losses and/or a reduction in the fair value of our
securities portfolio.

(g)    Includes net unrealized gains on derivatives hedging securities available-for-sale (including terminated hedges) of $1,764 million at June 30, 2022 and $2,948 million at Sept. 30,

2022.

(h)    At Sept. 30, 2022, includes net unrealized losses of $3,747 million related to available-for-sale securities, net of hedges, and $6,772 million related to held-to-maturity securities.

The fair value of our securities portfolio, including related
hedges, was $140.4 billion at Sept. 30, 2022, compared
with $158.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2021. The decrease
primarily reflects unrealized pre-tax losses and lower
agency RMBS, partially offset by an increase in U.S.
Treasury securities.

At Sept. 30, 2022, the securities portfolio had a net
unrealized loss, including the impact of related hedges, of
$10.5 billion, compared with a net unrealized gain,
including the impact of related hedges, of $384 million at
Dec. 31, 2021. The increase in the net unrealized loss,
including the impact of hedges, was primarily driven by
higher market interest rates.

The fair value of the available-for-sale securities totaled
$89.9 billion at Sept. 30, 2022, net of hedges, or 64% of
the securities portfolio, net of hedges. The fair value of the
held-to-maturity securities totaled $50.5 billion at Sept. 30,
2022, or 36% of the securities portfolio, net of hedges.

The unrealized loss (after-tax) on our available-for-sale
securities portfolio, net of hedges, included in accumulated
other comprehensive income was $2.8 billion at Sept. 30,
2022, compared with an unrealized gain (after-tax), net of
hedges, of $362 million at Dec. 31, 2021. The increase in
the unrealized loss, net of tax, was primarily driven by
higher market interest rates.

At Sept. 30, 2022, 98% of the securities in our portfolio
were rated AAA/AA-, compared with 96% at Dec. 31,
2021.

At Sept. 30, 2022, total lending-related exposure of $121.9
billion increased 5% compared with Dec. 31, 2021,
primarily reflecting higher exposure in the financial
institutions and capital call financing portfolios, higher
overdrafts and higher exposure to the wealth management
loans and wealth management mortgages portfolios,
partially offset by lower margin loans.

Our financial institutions and commercial portfolios
comprise our largest concentrated risk. These portfolios
comprised 48% of our total exposure at Sept. 30, 2022 and
47% at Dec. 31, 2021. Additionally, most of our overdrafts
relate to financial institutions.

The financial institutions portfolio exposure was $44.3
billion at Sept. 30, 2022, an increase of 9% compared with
Dec. 31, 2021, primarily reflecting higher exposure in the
banks, securities industry and asset managers portfolios.

Financial institution exposures are high quality, with 96%
of the exposures meeting the investment grade equivalent
criteria of our internal credit rating classification at Sept.
30, 2022. Each customer is assigned an internal credit
rating, which is mapped to an equivalent external rating
agency grade based upon a number of dimensions, which
are continually evaluated and may change over time. For
ratings of non-U.S. counterparties, our internal credit rating
is generally capped at a rating equivalent to the sovereign
rating of the country where the counterparty resides,
regardless of the internal credit rating assigned to the
counterparty or the underlying collateral.

The exposure to financial institutions is generally short
term, with 84% of the exposures expiring within one year.
At Sept. 30, 2022, 55% of the exposure to financial
institutions had an expiration within 90 days, compared
with 17% at Dec. 31, 2021.

In addition, 66% of the financial institutions exposure is
secured. For example, securities industry clients

and asset managers often borrow against marketable
securities held in custody.

At Sept. 30, 2022, the secured intra-day credit provided to
dealers in connection with their tri-party repo activity
totaled $16.9 billion and was included in the securities
industry portfolio. Dealers secure the outstanding intra-day
credit with high-quality liquid collateral having a market
value in excess of the amount of the outstanding credit.
Secured intraday credit facilities represent approximately
38% of the exposure in the financial institutions portfolio
and are reviewed and reapproved annually.

The asset managers portfolio exposure is high quality, with
99% of the exposures meeting our investment grade
equivalent ratings criteria as of Sept. 30, 2022. These
exposures are generally short-term liquidity facilities, with
the majority to regulated mutual funds.

Our banks portfolio exposure primarily relates to our
global trade finance. These exposures are short term in
nature, with 97% due in less than one year. The investment
grade percentage of our banks portfolio exposure was 87%
at Sept. 30, 2022, compared with 88% at Dec. 31, 2021.
Our non-investment grade exposures are primarily trade
finance loans in Brazil.

Wealth management loans

Our wealth management loan exposure was $11.3 billion at
Sept. 30, 2022, compared with $10.3 billion

at Dec. 31, 2021. Wealth management loans primarily
consist of loans to high-net-worth individuals, a majority
of which are secured by the customers’ investment
management accounts or custody accounts.

Wealth management mortgages

Our wealth management mortgage exposure was $9.2
billion at Sept. 30, 2022, compared with $8.6 billion at
Dec. 31, 2021. Wealth management mortgages primarily
consist of loans to high-net-worth individuals, which are
secured by residential property. Wealth management
mortgages are primarily interest-only, adjustable-rate
mortgages with a weighted-average loan-to-value ratio of
61% at origination. At Sept. 30, 2022, less than 1% of the
mortgages were past due.

At Sept. 30, 2022, the wealth management mortgage
portfolio consisted of the following geographic
concentrations: California – 21%; New York – 15%;
Florida – 11%; Massachusetts – 8%; and other – 45%.

Our commercial real estate exposure totaled $9.9 billion at
Sept. 30, 2022 and $9.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2021. Our
income-producing commercial real estate facilities are
focused on experienced owners and are structured with
moderate leverage based on existing cash flows. Our
commercial real estate lending activities also include
construction and renovation facilities. Our client base
consists of experienced developers and long-term holders
of real estate assets. Loans are approved on the basis of
existing or projected cash flows and supported by
appraisals and knowledge of local market conditions.
Development loans are structured with moderate leverage
and, in many instances, involve some level of recourse to
the developer.

At Sept. 30, 2022, the unsecured portfolio consisted of real
estate investment trusts (“REITs”) and real estate operating
companies, which are both primarily investment grade.

At Sept. 30, 2022, our commercial real estate portfolio
consisted of the following concentrations: New York metro
– 36%; REITs and real estate operating companies – 29%;
and other – 35%.

Lease financings

The lease financings portfolio exposure totaled $702
million at Sept. 30, 2022 and $731 million at Dec. 31,
2021. At Sept. 30, 2022, approximately 99% of leasing
exposure was investment grade, or investment grade
equivalent and consisted of exposures backed by well-
diversified assets, primarily real estate and large-ticket
transportation equipment. The largest components of our

The other residential mortgages portfolio primarily consists
of 1-4 family residential mortgage loans and totaled $356
million at Sept. 30, 2022 and $299 million at Dec. 31,
2021. Included in this portfolio at Sept. 30, 2022 were $94
million of fixed-rate jumbo mortgage loans purchased in
the second quarter of 2022 with a weighted-average loan-
to-value ratio of 69% at origination.

Overdrafts

Overdrafts primarily relate to custody and securities
clearance clients and are generally repaid within two
business days.

Capital call financing

Capital call financing includes loans to private equity funds
that are secured by the fund investors’ capital commitments
and the funds’ rights to call capital.

Other loans

Other loans primarily include loans to consumers that are
fully collateralized with equities, mutual funds and fixed-

excess of 100% of the value of the loan. Margin loans
included $5.3 billion at Sept. 30, 2022 and $7.7 billion at
Dec. 31, 2021 related to a term loan program that offers
fully collateralized loans to broker-dealers.

Our credit strategy is to focus on investment grade clients who are active users of our non-credit services. Our primary exposure
to the credit risk of a customer consists of funded loans, unfunded contractual commitments to lend, standby letters of credit
and overdrafts associated with our custody and securities clearance businesses.

(a)    Includes allowance for credit losses on federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements, available-for-sale securities, held-to-

maturity securities, accounts receivable, cash and due from banks and interest-bearing deposits with banks.

The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $30 million
in the third quarter of 2022, primarily reflecting reserve
releases related to cash balances with exposure to Russia
and a modest benefit from our commercial real estate
portfolio.

The allowance for loan losses and allowance for lending-
related commitments represent management’s estimate of
lifetime expected losses in our credit portfolio. This
evaluation process is

subject to numerous estimates and judgments. To the extent
actual results differ from forecasts or management’s
judgment, the allowance for credit losses may be greater or
less than future charge-offs.

Based on an evaluation of the allowance for credit losses as
discussed in “Critical accounting estimates” in our 2021
Annual Report, we have allocated our allowance for loans
and lending-related commitments as presented below.

(a)    The allowance allocated to margin loans and overdrafts was insignificant at Sept. 30, 2022, June 30, 2022, Dec. 31, 2021 and Sept. 30, 2021.

The allocation of the allowance for credit losses is
inherently judgmental, and the entire allowance for credit
losses is available to absorb credit losses regardless of the
nature of the losses.

Our allowance for credit losses is sensitive to a number of
inputs, most notably the credit ratings assigned to each
borrower, as well as macroeconomic forecast assumptions
that are incorporated in our estimate of credit losses
through the expected life of the loan portfolio. Thus, as the
macroeconomic environment and related forecasts change,
the allowance for credit losses may change materially. The
following sensitivity analyses do not represent
management’s expectations of the deterioration of our
portfolios or the economic environment, but are provided
as hypothetical scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the
allowance for credit losses to changes in key inputs. If
commercial real estate property values were increased 10%
and all other credit were rated one grade better, the
quantitative allowance would have decreased by
$32 million, and if commercial real estate property values
were decreased 10% and all other credit were rated one
grade worse, the quantitative allowance would have
increased by $64 million. Our multi-scenario based
macroeconomic forecast used in determining the Sept. 30,
2022 allowance for credit losses consisted of three
scenarios. The baseline scenario reflects slowing GDP
growth through the end of 2022, and slightly rising
unemployment and moderating growth in commercial real
estate prices through the end of 2023. The upside scenario
reflects faster GDP growth, slightly declining
unemployment and higher commercial real estate prices
compared with the baseline. The downside scenario
contemplates negative GDP growth through the first
quarter of 2023 with subsequent stabilization as well as

32 BNY Mellon

increasing unemployment through 2023 and lower
commercial real estate prices than the baseline. In the third
quarter of 2022, we placed the most weight on our baseline
scenario, followed by the downside scenario, with the
remaining weighting placed on the upside scenario. From a
sensitivity perspective, at Sept. 30, 2022, if we had applied
100% weighting to the downside scenario, the allowance
for credit losses would have been approximately
$96 million higher.

Total deposits were $302.0 billion at Sept. 30, 2022, a
decrease of 6%, compared with $319.7 billion at Dec. 31,
2021. The decrease reflects lower interest-bearing deposits
in U.S. offices, noninterest-bearing

deposits (principally U.S. offices) and interest-bearing
deposits in non-U.S. offices.

Noninterest-bearing deposits were $88.3 billion at Sept. 30,
2022, compared with $93.7 billion at Dec. 31, 2021.
Interest-bearing deposits were primarily demand deposits
and totaled $213.7 billion at Sept. 30, 2022, compared with
$226.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2021.

Short-term borrowings

We fund ourselves primarily through deposits and, to a
lesser extent, other short-term borrowings and long-term
debt. Short-term borrowings consist of federal funds
purchased and securities sold under repurchase
agreements, payables to customers and broker-dealers,
commercial paper and other borrowed funds. Certain short-
term borrowings, for example, securities sold under
repurchase agreements, require the delivery of securities as
collateral.

Federal funds purchased and securities sold under
repurchase agreements include repurchase agreement
activity with the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation
(“FICC”), where we record interest expense on a gross
basis, but the ending and average balances reflect the
impact of offsetting under enforceable netting agreements.
This activity primarily relates to government securities
collateralized resale and repurchase agreements executed
with clients that are novated to and settle with the FICC.

Payables to customers and broker-dealers represent funds
awaiting reinvestment and short sale proceeds payable on
demand. Payables to customers and broker-dealers are
driven by customer trading activity and market volatility.

The Bank of New York Mellon may issue commercial
paper that matures within 397 days from the date of issue
and is not redeemable prior to maturity or subject to
voluntary prepayment.

Other borrowed funds primarily include overdrafts of sub-
custodian account balances in our Securities Services
businesses, finance lease liabilities, and borrowings under
lines of credit by our Pershing subsidiaries. Overdrafts
typically relate to timing differences for settlements.

Liquidity and dividends

BNY Mellon defines liquidity as the ability of the Parent
and its subsidiaries to access funding or convert assets to
cash quickly and efficiently, or to roll over or issue new
debt, especially during periods of market stress, at a
reasonable cost, and in order to meet its short-term (up to
one year) obligations. Funding liquidity risk is the risk that
BNY Mellon cannot meet its cash and collateral
obligations at a reasonable cost for both expected and
unexpected cash flow and collateral needs without
adversely affecting daily operations or our financial
condition. Funding liquidity risk can arise from funding
mismatches, market constraints from the inability to
convert assets into cash, the inability to hold or raise cash,
low overnight deposits, deposit run-off or contingent
liquidity events.

Changes in economic conditions or exposure to credit,
market, operational, legal and reputational risks also can
affect BNY Mellon’s liquidity risk profile and are
considered in our liquidity risk framework. For additional
information, see “Risk Management – Liquidity Risk” in
our 2021 Annual Report.

The Parent’s policy is to have access to sufficient
unencumbered cash and cash equivalents at each quarter-
end to cover maturities and other forecasted debt
redemptions, net interest payments and net tax payments
for the following 18-month period, and to provide
sufficient collateral to satisfy transactions subject to
Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. As of Sept. 30,
2022, the Parent was in compliance with this policy.

We monitor and control liquidity exposures and funding
needs within and across significant legal entities, branches,
currencies and business lines, taking into account, among
other factors, any applicable restrictions on the transfer of
liquidity among entities.

BNY Mellon also manages potential intraday liquidity
risks. We monitor and manage intraday liquidity against
existing and expected intraday liquid resources (such as
cash balances, remaining intraday credit capacity, intraday
contingency funding and available collateral) to enable
BNY Mellon to meet its intraday obligations under normal
and reasonably severe stressed conditions.

BNY Mellon 33

We define available funds for internal liquidity
management purposes as cash and due from banks,
interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve

and other central banks, interest-bearing deposits with
banks and federal funds sold and securities purchased
under resale agreements.

Total available funds were $149.5 billion at Sept. 30, 2022,
compared with $154.8 billion at Dec. 31, 2021. The
decrease was primarily due to lower federal funds sold and
securities purchased under resale agreements and interest-
bearing deposits with banks, partially offset by higher
interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and
other central banks.

Average non-core sources of funds, such as federal funds
purchased and securities sold under repurchase
agreements, trading liabilities, other borrowed funds and
commercial paper were $16.4 billion for the first nine
months of 2022 and $16.9 billion for the first nine months
of 2021. The decrease primarily reflects lower federal
funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase
agreements, partially offset by higher trading liabilities and
other borrowed funds.

Average interest-bearing foreign deposits, primarily from
our European-based businesses included in the Securities
Services and Market and Wealth Services segments, were
$103.0 billion for the first nine months of 2022, compared
with $112.9 billion for the first nine months of 2021.
Average interest-bearing domestic deposits were $112.3
billion for the first nine months of 2022 and $126.4 billion
for the first nine months of 2021. The decreases primarily
reflect client activity.

Average payables to customers and broker-dealers were
$17.1 billion for the first nine months of 2022 and $17.0
billion for the first nine months of 2021.

34 BNY Mellon

Payables to customers and broker-dealers are driven by
customer trading activity and market volatility.

Average long-term debt was $26.8 billion for the first nine
months of 2022 and $25.7 billion for the first nine months
of 2021.

Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased to $89.0
billion for the first nine months of 2022 from $84.9 billion
for the first nine months of 2021, primarily reflecting client
activity.

A significant reduction of client activity in our Securities
Services and Market and Wealth Services business
segments would reduce our access to deposits. See
“Asset/liability management” for additional factors that
could impact our deposit balances.

Sources of liquidity

The Parent’s major sources of liquidity are access to the
debt and equity markets, dividends from its subsidiaries,
and cash on hand and cash otherwise made available in
business-as-usual circumstances to the Parent through a
committed credit facility with our intermediate holding
company (“IHC”).

Our ability to access the capital markets on favorable
terms, or at all, is partially dependent on our credit ratings,
which are as follows:

Long-term debt totaled $27.8 billion at Sept. 30, 2022 and
$25.9 billion at Dec. 31, 2021. Issuances of $6.7 billion
were partially offset by redemptions and maturities of $3.3
billion and a decrease in the fair value of hedged long-term
debt. No long-term debt will mature in the fourth quarter of
2022.

In October 2022, the Parent issued $1.0 billion of fixed to
floating rate senior notes maturing in 2028. The annual
fixed interest rate is 5.802% from issuance to, but
excluding, Oct. 25, 2027, and then an annual interest rate
of the compounded secured overnight financing rate
(“SOFR”) plus 180.2 basis points. The Parent also issued
$1.5 billion of fixed to floating rate senior notes maturing
in 2033. The annual fixed interest rate is 5.834% from
issuance to, but excluding, Oct. 25, 2032, and then an
annual interest rate of the compounded SOFR plus 207.4
basis points.

In October 2022, the Parent redeemed all of the issued and
outstanding floating rate senior notes due Oct. 30, 2023 at
par plus any accrued and unpaid interest. The notes have an
aggregate principal amount of $750 million.

The Bank of New York Mellon may issue notes and
certificates of deposit (“CDs”). At Sept. 30, 2022 and Dec.
31, 2021, $30 million of notes were outstanding. At Sept.
30, 2022, $20 million of CDs were outstanding. There
were no CDs outstanding at Dec. 31, 2021.

The Bank of New York Mellon also issues commercial
paper that matures within 397 days from the date of issue
and is not redeemable prior to maturity or subject to
voluntary prepayment. There was no commercial paper
outstanding at Sept. 30, 2022 and Dec. 31, 2021. The
average commercial paper outstanding was $5 million for
the first nine months of 2022 and $4 million for the first
nine months of 2021.

Subsequent to Sept. 30, 2022, our U.S. bank subsidiaries
could declare dividends to the Parent of approximately
$3.0 billion, without the need for a regulatory waiver. In
addition, at Sept. 30, 2022, non-bank subsidiaries of the
Parent had liquid assets of approximately $4.8 billion.
Restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our
subsidiaries are discussed in more detail in “Supervision
and Regulation – Capital Planning and Stress Testing –
Payment of Dividends, Stock Repurchases and Other
Capital Distributions” and in Note 19 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, both in our 2021
Annual Report.

Pershing LLC has uncommitted lines of credit in place for
liquidity purposes that are guaranteed by the Parent.
Pershing LLC has two separate uncommitted lines of credit
amounting to $350 million in aggregate. There were no
average borrowings under these lines in the third quarter of
2022. Pershing Limited, an indirect UK-based subsidiary
of BNY Mellon, has two separate uncommitted lines of
credit

  
 
amounting to $254 million in aggregate. Average
borrowings under these lines were less than $1 million in
the third quarter of 2022.

The following table presents BNY Mellon’s consolidated
HQLA at Sept. 30, 2022, and the average HQLA and
average LCR for the third quarter of 2022.

BNY Mellon 35

The double leverage ratio is the ratio of our equity
investment in subsidiaries divided by our consolidated
Parent company equity, which includes our noncumulative
perpetual preferred stock. In short, the double leverage
ratio measures the extent to which equity in subsidiaries is
financed by Parent company debt. As the double leverage
ratio increases, this can reflect greater demands on a
company’s cash flows in order to service interest payments
and debt maturities. BNY Mellon’s double leverage ratio is
managed in a range considering the high level of
unencumbered available liquid assets held in its principal
subsidiaries (such as central bank deposit placements and
government securities), the Company’s cash generating
fee-based business model, with fee revenue representing
76% of total revenue in the third quarter of 2022, and the
dividend capacity of our banking subsidiaries. Our double
leverage ratio was 119.6% at Sept. 30, 2022 and 119.3% at
Dec. 31, 2021, and within the range targeted by
management.

Uses of funds

The Parent’s major uses of funds are repurchases of
common stock, payment of dividends, principal and
interest payments on its borrowings, acquisitions and
additional investments in its subsidiaries.

In August 2022, a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per common
share was paid to common shareholders. Our common
stock dividend payout ratio was 95% for the third quarter
of 2022.

In the third quarter of 2022, we repurchased 36 thousand
common shares at an average price of $48.07 per common
share, for a total cost of $1 million.

Liquidity coverage ratio (“LCR”)

U.S. regulators have established an LCR that requires
certain banking organizations, including BNY Mellon, to
maintain a minimum amount of unencumbered high-
quality liquid assets (“HQLA”) sufficient to withstand the
net cash outflow under a hypothetical standardized acute
liquidity stress scenario for a 30-day time horizon.

BNY Mellon and each of our affected domestic bank
subsidiaries were compliant with the U.S. LCR
requirements of at least 100% throughout the third quarter
of 2022.

Statement of cash flows

The following summarizes the activity reflected on the
consolidated statement of cash flows. While this
information may be helpful to highlight certain macro
trends and business strategies, the cash flow analysis may
not be as relevant when analyzing changes in our net
earnings and net assets. We believe that in addition to the
traditional cash flow analysis, the discussion related to
liquidity and dividends and asset/liability management
herein may provide more useful context in evaluating our
liquidity position and related activity.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $12.1 billion
in the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2022, compared with
net cash used for operating activities of $291 million in the
nine months ended Sept. 30, 2021. In the nine months
ended Sept. 30, 2022, cash flows provided by operations
primarily resulted from changes in trading assets and
liabilities and earnings. In the nine months ended Sept. 30,
2021, cash flows used for operations primarily resulted
from changes in trading assets and liabilities, partially
offset by earnings.

Net cash used for investing activities was $5.3 billion in
the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2022, compared

36 BNY Mellon

with net cash used for investing activities of $259 million
in the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2021. In the nine
months ended Sept. 30, 2022, net cash used for investing
activities primarily resulted from changes in interest-
bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central
banks, partially offset by changes in federal funds sold and
securities purchased under resale agreements. In the nine
months ended Sept. 30, 2021, net cash used for investing
activities primarily resulted from the net change in loans
and securities, partially offset by changes in interest-
bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central
banks.

Net cash used for financing activities was $7.5 billion in
the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2022, compared

with net cash provided by financing activities of $2.2
billion in the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2021. In the nine
months ended Sept. 30, 2022, net cash used for financing
activities primarily resulted from changes in deposits,
repayments of long-term debt and changes in payables to
customers and broker-dealers, partially offset by proceeds
from the issuance of long-term debt. In the nine months
ended Sept. 30, 2021, net cash provided by financing
activities primarily resulted from changes in deposits,
issuances of long-term debt and changes in payables to
customers and broker-dealers, partially offset by
repayments of long-term debt and common stock
repurchases.

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation total
shareholders’ equity decreased to $40 billion at Sept. 30,
2022 from $43 billion at Dec. 31, 2021. The decrease
primarily reflects unrealized losses on securities available-
for-sale, foreign currency translation and dividend
payments, partially offset by earnings.

The unrealized loss (after-tax) on our available-for-sale
securities portfolio, net of hedges, included in accumulated
other comprehensive income was $2.8 billion at Sept. 30,
2022, compared with an unrealized gain (after-tax), net of
hedges, of $362 million at Dec. 31, 2021. The increase in
the unrealized loss, net of

tax, was primarily driven by higher market interest rates.

In the first nine months of 2022, we repurchased 2.0
million common shares at an average price of $61.38 per
common share for a total of $122 million.

In June 2021, our Board of Directors authorized the
repurchase of up to $6.0 billion of common shares over the
six quarters beginning in the third quarter of 2021 and
continuing through the fourth quarter of 2022. This share
repurchase plan replaced all previously authorized share
repurchase plans.

BNY Mellon 37

In July, our Board of Directors approved a 9% increase in
the quarterly cash dividend on common stock, from $0.34
to $0.37 per share. The increased quarterly cash dividend
was paid on Aug. 5, 2022.

Capital adequacy

Regulators establish certain levels of capital for bank
holding companies (“BHCs”) and banks, including BNY
Mellon and our bank subsidiaries, in accordance with
established quantitative measurements. For the Parent to
maintain its status as a financial holding company, our U.S.
bank subsidiaries and BNY Mellon must, among other
things, qualify as “well capitalized.” As of Sept. 30, 2022
and Dec. 31, 2021, BNY Mellon and our U.S. bank
subsidiaries were “well capitalized.” Failure to satisfy
regulatory standards, including “well capitalized” status or
capital adequacy rules more

generally, could result in limitations on our activities and
adversely affect our financial condition. See the discussion
of these matters in “Supervision and Regulation –
Regulated Entities of BNY Mellon and Ancillary
Regulatory Requirements” and “Risk Factors – Capital and
Liquidity Risk – Failure to satisfy regulatory standards,
including “well capitalized” and “well managed” status or
capital adequacy and liquidity rules more generally, could
result in limitations on our activities and adversely affect
our business and financial condition,” both of which are in
our 2021 Annual Report.

The U.S. banking agencies’ capital rules are based on the
framework adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision, as amended from time to time. For additional
information on these capital requirements, see
“Supervision and Regulation” in our 2021 Annual Report.

(a)    Minimum requirements for Sept. 30, 2022 include minimum thresholds plus currently applicable buffers. The U.S. global systemically important banks
(“G-SIB”) surcharge is 1.5%. The countercyclical capital buffer is currently set to 0%. The stress capital buffer (“SCB”) requirement is 2.5%, equal to
the regulatory minimum for Standardized Approach capital ratios.

(b)    For our CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios, our effective capital ratios under U.S. capital rules are the lower of the ratios as calculated

under the Standardized and Advanced Approaches. The Tier 1 leverage ratio is based on Tier 1 capital and quarterly average total assets.

(c)    The Federal Reserve’s regulations do not establish well capitalized thresholds for these measures for BHCs.
(d)    The SLR is based on Tier 1 capital and total leverage exposure, which includes certain off-balance sheet exposures.

38 BNY Mellon

Our CET1 ratio under the Standardized Approach was
10.0% at Sept. 30, 2022 and 11.2% at Dec. 31, 2021. The
decrease was primarily driven by unrealized losses on
securities available-for-sale, foreign currency translation
and capital deployed through dividends, partially offset by
capital generated through earnings.

In the first quarter of 2022, we implemented the
Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk (“SA-
CCR”), which replaced the current exposure method used
to measure derivative counterparty exposure.

The Tier 1 leverage ratio was 5.4% at Sept. 30, 2022,
compared with 5.5% at Dec. 31, 2021. The decrease
reflects the decrease in capital, partially offset by the
benefit of lower average assets.

Risk-based capital ratios vary depending on the size of the
balance sheet at period-end and the levels and types of
investments in assets, and leverage ratios vary based on the
average size of the balance sheet over the quarter. The
balance sheet size fluctuates from period to period based
on levels of customer and market activity. In general, when
servicing clients are more actively trading securities,
deposit balances and the balance sheet as a whole are
higher. In addition, when markets experience significant
volatility or stress, our balance sheet size may increase
considerably as client deposit levels increase.

Our capital ratios are necessarily subject to, among other
things, anticipated compliance with all necessary
enhancements to model calibration, approval by regulators
of certain models used as part of RWA calculations, other
refinements, further implementation guidance from
regulators, market practices and standards and any changes
BNY Mellon may make to its businesses. As a
consequence of these factors, our capital ratios may
materially change, and may be volatile over time and from
period to period.

Under the Advanced Approaches, our operational loss risk
model is informed by external losses, including fines and
penalties levied against institutions in the financial services
industry, particularly those that relate to businesses in
which we operate, and as a result, external losses have
impacted and could in the future impact the amount of
capital that we are required to hold.

The table below presents the factors that impacted CET1
capital.

Stress capital buffer

In August 2022, the Federal Reserve announced that BNY
Mellon’s SCB requirement would be 2.5%, equal to the
regulatory floor, effective as of Oct. 1, 2022. The SCB
replaced the static 2.5% capital conservation buffer for
Standardized Approach capital ratios for CCAR BHCs.
The SCB does not apply to bank subsidiaries, which
remain subject to the static 2.5% capital conservation
buffer.

The SCB final rule generally eliminates the requirement
for prior approval of common stock repurchases in excess
of the distributions in a firm’s capital plan, provided that
such distributions are consistent with applicable capital
requirements and buffers, including the SCB.

equity repurchases and discretionary executive
compensation based on the amount of the shortfall and
eligible retained income.

Trading activities and risk management

Our trading activities are focused on acting as a market-
maker for our customers, facilitating customer trades and
risk-mitigating hedging in compliance with the Volcker
Rule. The risk from market-making activities for customers
is managed by our traders and limited in total exposure
through a system of position limits, value-at-risk (“VaR”)
methodology and other market sensitivity measures. VaR is
the potential loss in value due to adverse market
movements over a defined time horizon with a specified
confidence level. The calculation of our VaR used by
management and presented below assumes a one-day
holding period, utilizes a 99% confidence level and
incorporates non-linear product characteristics. VaR
facilitates comparisons across portfolios of different risk
characteristics. VaR also captures the diversification of
aggregated risk at the firm-wide level.

See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information on the VaR
methodology.

The following tables indicate the calculated VaR amounts
for the trading portfolio for the designated periods using
the historical simulation VaR model.

N/M – Because the minimum and maximum may occur on different days for
different risk components, it is not meaningful to compute a minimum
and maximum portfolio diversification effect.

The interest rate component of VaR represents instruments
whose values are predominantly driven by interest rate
levels. These instruments include, but are not limited to,
U.S. Treasury securities, swaps, swaptions, forward rate
agreements, exchange-traded futures and options, and other
interest rate derivative products.

The foreign exchange component of VaR represents
instruments whose values predominantly vary with the
level or volatility of currency exchange rates or interest
rates. These instruments include, but are not limited to,
currency balances, spot and forward transactions, currency
options and other currency derivative products.

The equity component of VaR consists of instruments that
represent an ownership interest in the form of domestic and
foreign common stock or other equity-linked instruments.
These instruments include, but are not limited to, common
stock, exchange-traded funds, preferred stock, listed equity
options (puts and calls), OTC equity options, equity total
return swaps, equity index futures and other equity
derivative products.

The credit component of VaR represents instruments whose
values are predominantly driven by credit spread levels,
i.e., idiosyncratic default risk. These instruments include,
but are not limited to, single

issuer credit default swaps, securities with exposures from
corporate and municipal credit spreads.

The diversification component of VaR is the risk reduction
benefit that occurs when combining portfolios and
offsetting positions, and from the correlated behavior of
risk factor movements.

During the third quarter of 2022, interest rate risk
generated 40% of average gross VaR, foreign exchange
risk generated 39% of average gross VaR, equity risk
generated 2% of average gross VaR and credit risk
generated 19% of average gross VaR. During the third
quarter of 2022, our daily trading loss did not exceed our
calculated VaR amount of the overall portfolio.

The following table of total daily trading revenue or loss
illustrates the number of trading days in which our trading
revenue or loss fell within particular ranges during the past
five quarters.

derivatives and securities trades for our customers and excludes any

associated commissions, underwriting fees and net interest revenue.

Trading assets include debt and equity instruments and
derivative assets, primarily foreign exchange and interest
rate contracts, not designated as hedging instruments.
Trading assets were $12.7 billion at Sept. 30, 2022 and
$16.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2021.

Trading liabilities include debt and equity instruments and
derivative liabilities, primarily foreign exchange and
interest rate contracts, not designated as hedging
instruments. Trading liabilities were $7.5 billion at Sept.
30, 2022 and $5.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2021.

Under our fair value methodology for derivative contracts,
an initial “risk-neutral” valuation is performed on each
position assuming time-discounting based on a AA credit
curve. In addition,

42 BNY Mellon

we consider credit risk in arriving at the fair value of our
derivatives.

Asset/liability management

We reflect external credit ratings as well as observable
credit default swap spreads for both ourselves and our
counterparties when measuring the fair value of our
derivative positions. Accordingly, the valuation of our
derivative positions is sensitive to the current changes in
our own credit spreads, as well as those of our
counterparties.

At Sept. 30, 2022, our OTC derivative assets, including
those in hedging relationships, of $5.0 billion included a
credit valuation adjustment (“CVA”) deduction of $20
million. Our OTC derivative liabilities, including those in
hedging relationships, of $4.0 billion included a debit
valuation adjustment (“DVA”) of $7 million related to our
own credit spread. Net of hedges, the CVA decreased by $2
million and the DVA increased by $1 million in the third
quarter of 2022, which increased investment and other
revenue - other trading revenue by $3 million. The net
impact increased investment and other revenue - other
trading revenue by $2 million in the second quarter of 2022
and decreased investment and other revenue - other trading
revenue by less than $1 million in the third quarter of 2021.

The table below summarizes the distribution of credit
ratings for our foreign exchange and interest rate derivative
counterparties over the past five quarters, which indicates
the level of counterparty credit associated with these
trading activities. Beginning in the third quarter of 2022,
equity derivative counterparties are also included.
Significant changes in counterparty credit ratings could
alter the level of credit risk faced by BNY Mellon.

Our diversified business activities include processing
securities, accepting deposits, investing in securities,
lending, raising money as needed to fund assets and other
transactions. The market risks from these activities include
interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. Our primary
market risk is exposure to movements in U.S. dollar
interest rates and certain foreign currency interest rates. We
actively manage interest rate sensitivity and use earnings
simulation and discounted cash flow models to identify
interest rate exposures.

An earnings simulation model is the primary tool used to
assess changes in pre-tax net interest revenue between a
baseline scenario and hypothetical interest rate scenarios.
Interest rate sensitivity is quantified by calculating the
change in pre-tax net interest revenue between the
scenarios over a 12-month measurement period.

The baseline scenario incorporates the market’s forward
rate expectations and management’s assumptions regarding
client deposit rates, credit spreads, changes in the
prepayment behavior of loans and securities and the impact
of derivative financial instruments used for interest rate
risk management purposes as of Sept. 30, 2022. These
assumptions have been developed through a combination
of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior
and are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ
materially from projected results due to timing, magnitude
and frequency of interest rate changes, and changes in
market conditions and management’s strategies, among
other factors. Client deposit levels and mix are key
assumptions impacting net interest revenue in the baseline
as well as the hypothetical interest rate scenarios. The
earnings simulation model assumes static deposit levels
and mix and it also assumes that no management actions
will be taken to mitigate the effects of interest rate changes.
Typically, the baseline scenario uses the average deposit
balances of the quarter.

In the table below, we use the earnings simulation model to
assess the impact of various hypothetical interest rate
scenarios compared to the baseline scenario. In each of the
scenarios, all currencies’ interest rates are instantaneously
shifted higher or lower. The scenarios assume
instantaneous rate changes at the start of the forecast.
Long-term interest rates are defined as all tenors equal to
or

BNY Mellon 43

While the net interest revenue sensitivity scenario
calculations assume static deposit balances to facilitate
consistent period-over-period comparisons, it is likely that
a portion of deposits would run off in a rising short-term
rate environment. Noninterest-bearing deposits are
particularly sensitive to changes in short-term rates.

To illustrate the net interest revenue sensitivity to deposit
run-off, we estimate that a $5 billion instantaneous
reduction of U.S. dollar denominated noninterest-bearing
deposits would reduce the net interest revenue sensitivity
results in the up 100 basis point scenario compared with
the baseline in the table above by approximately $270
million. The impact would be smaller if the run-off was
assumed to be a mixture of interest-bearing and
noninterest-bearing deposits.

For a discussion of factors impacting the growth or
contraction of deposits, see “Risk Factors – Our business,
financial condition and results of operations could be
adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our
liquidity” in our 2021 Annual Report.

greater than three years and short-term interest rates are
defined as all tenors equal to or less than three months.
Interim term points are interpolated where applicable. The
scenarios are intended to provide information on a basis
that is consistent with industry practice.

for BNY Mellon.

The increase in nearly all of the rate sensitivities compared
with June 30, 2022 was primarily due to the rates paid on
interest-bearing deposits being slightly less sensitive to
changes in interest rates than previously modeled. The
investment portfolio is also slightly more sensitive to
changes in interest rates compared with June 30, 2022.

Supplemental information – Explanation of GAAP
and Non-GAAP financial measures

BNY Mellon has included in this Form 10-Q certain Non-
GAAP financial measures on a tangible basis as a
supplement to GAAP information, which exclude goodwill
and intangible assets, net of deferred tax liabilities. We
believe that the return on tangible common equity – Non-
GAAP is additional useful information for investors
because it presents a measure of those assets that can
generate income, and the tangible book value per common
share – Non-GAAP is additional useful information
because it presents the level of tangible assets in relation to
shares of common stock outstanding.

BNY Mellon has presented revenue measures excluding
notable items, including disposal gains. Expense measures,
excluding notable items, including goodwill impairment,
severance expense and litigation reserves, are also
presented. Litigation reserves represent accruals for loss
contingencies that are both probable and reasonably
estimable, but exclude standard business-related legal fees.
Income before taxes, net income applicable to common
shareholders of The Bank of New York Mellon
Corporation, diluted earnings per share, return on common
equity, return on tangible common equity, pre-tax operating
margin and the effective tax rate, excluding the notable
items mentioned above, are also provided. These measures
have been provided to permit investors to view the
financial measures on a basis consistent with how
management views the businesses.

BNY Mellon has presented income before tax, excluding
notable items for the Securities Services business segment.
This measure is provided to permit investors to view the
financial measures on a basis consistent with how
management views the businesses.

The presentation of the growth rates of investment
management and performance fees on a constant currency
basis permits investors to assess the significance of
changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Growth rates
on a constant currency basis were determined by applying
the current period foreign currency exchange rates to the
prior period revenue. We believe that this presentation, as a
supplement to GAAP information, gives investors a clearer
picture of the related revenue results without the variability
caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

BNY Mellon has also included the adjusted pre-tax
operating margin – Non-GAAP, which is the pre-tax
operating margin for the Investment and Wealth
Management business segment, net of distribution and
servicing expense that was passed to third parties who
distribute or service our managed funds. We believe that
this measure is useful when evaluating the performance of
the Investment and Wealth Management business segment
relative to industry competitors.

Recent accounting and regulatory developments

Recent accounting developments

The following accounting guidance issued by the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) has not yet been
adopted as of September 30, 2022.

Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2022-01,
Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value Hedging
– Portfolio Layer Method

In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-01,
Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value Hedging
– Portfolio Layer Method, which provides guidance that
expands the ability to hedge interest rate risk by permitting
the use of multiple hedged layers of a single closed
portfolio of assets and will (1) Allow multiple layer
hedging within the same closed portfolio, (2) Expand the
scope of the portfolio layer method to include non-
prepayable assets, (3) Expand the eligible hedging
instruments to be utilized in a single-layer hedge, and (4)
Permit held-to-maturity debt securities to be transferred to
available-for-sale at the date of adoption, provided such
transferred securities are designated in a portfolio layer
method hedge within 30 days of the adoption date.

The standard also provides further guidance and disclosure
requirements with respect to hedge basis adjustments
related to portfolio layer method hedges.

BNY Mellon is currently evaluating this guidance. This
ASU is effective Jan. 1, 2023, with early adoption
permitted.

ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses
(Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage
Disclosures

In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Financial
Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt
Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures, which provides
post-implementation guidance related to the adoption of
ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses:
Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,
which was effective Jan. 1, 2020. This ASU amends the
guidance related to two issues: Troubled Debt
Restructurings (“TDRs”) and disclosure requirements for
the credit profile of the loan portfolio. This ASU

eliminates the accounting guidance for TDRs by creditors,
while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan
refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a
borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. An entity
must apply the loan refinancing and restructuring guidance
to determine whether a modification results in a new loan
or a continuation of an existing loan.

This ASU also requires that an entity disclose current-
period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing
receivables and net investments in leases within the scope
of Subtopic 326-20, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses
– Measured at Amortized Cost.

We are currently evaluating this guidance. The ASU is
effective Jan. 1, 2023, with early adoption permitted.

Recent regulatory developments

For a summary of additional regulatory matters relevant to
our operations, see “Recent regulatory developments” in
our Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2022 and
June 30, 2022, and “Supervision and Regulation” in our
2021 Annual Report. The following discussion summarizes
certain regulatory, legislative and other developments that
may affect BNY Mellon.

Inflation Reduction Act

In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022
(“IRA”) was signed into law. The IRA includes a number
of changes to existing federal tax law including, among
other things, an excise tax on stock repurchases and a new
corporate alternative minimum tax. These provisions are
effective for tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2022. We
are currently assessing the impact of the IRA and will
continue to analyze as further guidance is issued.

Other matters

Replacement of Interbank Offered Rates (“IBORs”),
including LIBOR

The UK Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”) and the
administrator for LIBOR have announced that the
publication of the most commonly used U.S. dollar LIBOR
settings will cease to be published or cease to be
representative after June 30, 2023. The

BNY Mellon 49

publication of all other LIBOR settings ceased to be
published or to be representative as of Dec. 31, 2021. In
addition, the U.S. bank regulators had also issued guidance
strongly encouraging banking organizations to cease using
U.S. dollar LIBOR as a reference rate in new contracts by
Dec. 31, 2021. As a result, financial market participants
have begun to transition away from LIBOR and other
IBORs to alternative reference rates. The transition event
on Dec. 31, 2021 had minimal impact across BNY
Mellon’s businesses, however the remaining U.S. dollar
LIBOR transition will impact assets and liabilities on our
balance sheet that reference IBORs, investments that we
manage linked to IBORs in our Investment Management
business and the operational servicing of products that
reference IBORs in our Market and Wealth Services and
Securities Services business segments.

In March 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act
(the “LIBOR Act”) was enacted. The LIBOR Act provides
a statutory framework to replace U.S. dollar LIBOR with a
benchmark rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing
Rate (“SOFR”) for contracts governed by U.S. law that
have no fallbacks or fallbacks that would require the use of
a poll or LIBOR-based rate. Under the LIBOR Act, the
Federal Reserve must adopt rules to identify the SOFR-
based replacement rate and conforming changes for legacy
LIBOR-linked contracts. The Federal Reserve issued
proposed rules in July 2022, which have not yet been
finalized.

We are working to facilitate an orderly transition from
IBORs to alternative reference rates for us and our clients.
Accordingly, we have created a global transition program
with senior management oversight that focuses on, among
other things, evaluating and monitoring the impacts of the
discontinuance of reference IBORs and the transition to
replacement benchmarks on our business operations and
financial condition; identifying and evaluating the scope of
impacted financial instruments and contracts and the
attendant risks; and implementing technology systems,
models and analytics to support the transition. In addition,
we continue to actively engage with our regulators and
clients and participate in central bank and sector working
groups.

Despite the proximity of the June 30, 2023 cessation date,
there remain, however, a number of unknown factors
regarding the transition from the IBORs and/or interest rate
benchmark reforms that could impact

our business. For a further discussion of the various risks,
see “Risk Factors – Market Risk – Transitions away from
and the replacement of LIBOR and other IBORs could
adversely impact our business, financial condition and
results of operations” in our 2021 Annual Report.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1–Basis of presentation

In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, references to
“our,” “we,” “us,” “BNY Mellon,” the “Company” and
similar terms refer to The Bank of New York Mellon
Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. The term
“Parent” refers to The Bank of New York Mellon
Corporation but not to its subsidiaries.

Basis of presentation

The accounting and financial reporting policies of BNY
Mellon, a global financial services company, conform to
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”)
and prevailing industry practices. For information on our
significant accounting and reporting policies, see Note 1 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31,
2021 (the “2021 Annual Report”).

The accompanying consolidated financial statements are
unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments
necessary, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, for a
fair presentation of financial position, results of operations
and cash flows for the periods presented have been made.
These financial statements should be read in conjunction
with our Consolidated Financial Statements included in our
2021 Annual Report. Certain additional immaterial
reclassifications have been made to prior periods to place
them on a basis comparable with the current period
presentation.

Use of estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates based
upon assumptions about future economic and market
conditions which affect reported amounts and related
disclosures in our financial statements. Although our
current estimates contemplate current conditions and how
we expect them to change in the future, it is reasonably
possible that actual conditions could be worse than
anticipated in those estimates, which could materially
affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Note 2–New accounting guidance

Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121

In March 2022, the SEC staff released Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 121 (“SAB 121”). SAB 121

expresses the staff’s views regarding the accounting for
entities that have obligations to safeguard “crypto-assets”
held for their platform users. SAB 121 provides that these
entities should present a liability and corresponding asset
in respect of the crypto-assets safeguarded for their
platform users, with the liability and asset measured at the
fair value of the crypto-assets. This differs from the
accounting treatment of non-crypto-assets held in custody,
which do not result in assets recorded on a custodian’s
balance sheet. We adopted the guidance in the third quarter
of 2022 and recorded a de minimis asset and liability
related to digital assets we safeguard.

Note 3–Acquisitions and dispositions

We sometimes structure our acquisitions with both an
initial payment and later contingent payments tied to post-
closing revenue or income growth. There were no
contingent payments in the first nine months of 2022.

At Sept. 30, 2022, we were potentially obligated to pay
additional consideration which, using reasonable
assumptions and estimates, could range from $15 million
to $45 million over the next three years.

Goodwill and intangible assets related to acquisitions
completed in 2021 totaled $99 million and $70 million,
respectively. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements in our 2021 Annual Report for
information related to the 2021 acquisitions.

Transaction in 2022

On Aug. 1, 2022, BNY Mellon completed the sale of
HedgeMark Advisors, LLC (“HedgeMark”), and recorded
a $37 million pre-tax gain. As part of the sale, BNY Mellon
received an equity interest in the acquiring firm. In
addition, goodwill related to HedgeMark of $13 million
was removed from the consolidated balance sheet as result
of this sale.

Note 4–Securities

The following tables present the amortized cost, the gross
unrealized gains and losses and the fair value of securities
at Sept. 30, 2022 and Dec. 31, 2021.

In the second quarter of 2022, agency RMBS and agency
commercial MBS, with an aggregate amortized cost of
$975 million and fair value of $906 million, were
transferred from available-for-sale securities to held-to-
maturity securities.

In the first quarter of 2022, agency RMBS, U.S.
government agencies and agency commercial MBS, with
an aggregate amortized cost of $5.3 billion and fair value
of $5.2 billion, were transferred from available-for-sale
securities to held-to-maturity securities.

The above transfers reduce the impact of changes in
interest rates on accumulated other comprehensive income.

The allowance for credit losses related to securities was
$9 million at Sept. 30, 2022 and $10 million at Dec. 31,
2021, and primarily relates to the available-for-sale CLO
portfolio.

Credit quality indicators – Securities

At Sept. 30, 2022, the gross unrealized losses on the
securities portfolio were primarily attributable to an
increase in interest rates from the date of purchase, and for
certain securities that were transferred from available-for-
sale to held-to-maturity, an increase in interest rates
through the date they were transferred. Specifically, $188
million of the unrealized losses at Sept. 30, 2022 and $75
million at Dec. 31, 2021 reflected in the tables below relate
to certain securities that were previously transferred from
available-for-sale to held-to-maturity. The unrealized losses
will be amortized into net interest revenue over the
contractual lives of the securities. The transfer created a
new cost basis for the securities. As a result, if these
securities have experienced unrealized losses since the date
of transfer, the corresponding unrealized losses would be
reflected in the held-to-maturity securities portfolio in the
following tables. We do not intend to sell these securities,
and it is not more likely than not that we will have to sell
these securities.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

The following tables show the credit quality of the held-to-maturity securities. We have included certain credit ratings
information because the information can indicate the degree of credit risk to which we are exposed. Significant changes in
ratings classifications could indicate increased credit risk for us and could be accompanied by an increase in the allowance for
credit losses and/or a reduction in the fair value of our securities portfolio.

Pledged assets

At Sept. 30, 2022, BNY Mellon had pledged assets of $137
billion, including $106 billion pledged as collateral for
potential borrowings at the Federal Reserve Discount
Window and $8 billion pledged as collateral for borrowing
at the Federal Home Loan Bank. The components of the
assets pledged at Sept. 30, 2022 included $120 billion of
securities, $12 billion of loans, $4 billion of trading assets
and $1 billion of interest-bearing deposits with banks.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

At Sept. 30, 2022 and Dec. 31, 2021, pledged assets
included $22 billion and $24 billion, respectively, for
which the recipients were permitted to sell or repledge the
assets delivered.

We also obtain securities as collateral, including receipts
under resale agreements, securities borrowed, derivative
contracts and custody agreements, on terms which permit
us to sell or repledge the securities to others. At Sept. 30,
2022 and Dec. 31, 2021, the market value of the securities
received that can be sold or repledged was $99 billion and
$122 billion, respectively. We routinely sell or repledge
these securities through delivery to third parties. As of
Sept. 30, 2022 and Dec. 31, 2021, the market value of
securities collateral sold or repledged was $63 billion and
$78 billion, respectively.

Restricted cash and securities

Cash and securities may be segregated under federal and
other regulations or requirements. At Sept. 30, 2022 and
Dec. 31, 2021, cash segregated under federal and other
regulations or requirements was $5 billion and $4 billion,
respectively. Restricted cash is primarily included in
interest-bearing deposits with banks on the consolidated
balance sheet. Securities segregated under federal and
other regulations or requirements were $4 billion at Sept.
30, 2022 and $4 billion at Dec. 31, 2021. Restricted
securities were sourced from securities purchased under
resale agreements and are included in federal funds sold
and securities purchased under resale agreements on the
consolidated balance sheet.

other purposes. BNY Mellon regularly moves assets in and
out of its pledged assets account at the Federal Reserve.

At Dec. 31, 2021, BNY Mellon had pledged assets of $144
billion, including $112 billion pledged as collateral for
potential borrowing at the Federal Reserve Discount
Window and $7 billion pledged as collateral for borrowing
at the Federal Home Loan Bank. The components of the
assets pledged at Dec. 31, 2021 included $126 billion of
securities, $12 billion of loans, $5 billion of trading assets
and $1 billion of interest-bearing deposits with banks.

Loan modifications

A modified loan is considered a troubled debt restructuring
(“TDR”) if the debtor is experiencing financial difficulties
and the creditor grants a concession to the debtor that
would not otherwise be considered. A TDR may include a
transfer of real estate or other assets from the debtor to the
creditor, or a modification of the term of the loan. Not all
modified loans are considered TDRs. We modified eight
loans in the first nine months of 2022 with an aggregate
recorded investment of $13 million. The modifications of
the other residential and commercial real estate loans in the
first nine months of 2022 consisted of reducing the stated
interest rates and, in certain cases, forbearance of default
and extending the maturity dates.

TDRs that subsequently defaulted

There were two residential mortgage loans that had been
restructured in a TDR in 2022 and have subsequently
defaulted in the third quarter of 2022.

The total recorded investment of these loans was less than
$1 million.

Due to the coronavirus pandemic, there were two forms of
relief provided for classifying loans as TDRs: The
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the
“CARES Act”), the relevant provisions of which were
extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021,
and the Interagency Guidance. The extension period ended
Jan. 1, 2022. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements in our 2021 Annual Report for
additional details on the CARES Act, Consolidated
Appropriations Act, 2021, and Interagency Guidance.
Loans modified under the CARES Act or Interagency
Guidance totaled $23 million in the third quarter of 2021.
Nearly all of the modifications were short-term loan
payment forbearances or modified principal and/or interest
payments. These loans were primarily residential mortgage
and commercial real estate loans. We did not identify any
of the modifications as TDRs. At Sept. 30, 2022, the
unpaid principal balance of the loans modified under the
CARES Act or Interagency Guidance was $74 million.

Credit quality indicators

Our credit strategy is to focus on investment-grade clients
that are active users of our non-credit services. Each
customer is assigned an internal credit rating, which is
mapped to an external rating agency grade equivalent, if
possible, based upon a number of

dimensions, which are continually evaluated and may
change over time.

The tables below provide information about the credit
profile of the loan portfolio by the period of origination.

(a)    Excludes overdrafts of $3,060 million. Overdrafts occur on a daily basis primarily in the custody and securities clearance business and are generally repaid within two

business days.

Commercial loans

The commercial loan portfolio is divided into investment
grade and non-investment grade categories based on the
assigned internal credit ratings, which are generally
consistent with those of the public rating agencies.
Customers with ratings consistent with BBB- (S&P)/Baa3
(Moody’s) or better are considered to be investment grade.
Those clients with ratings lower than this threshold are
considered to be non-investment grade.

Commercial real estate

Our income-producing commercial real estate facilities are
focused on experienced owners and are structured with
moderate leverage based on existing cash flows. Our
commercial real estate lending activities also include
construction and renovation facilities.

Financial institutions

Financial institution exposures are high quality, with 96%
of the exposures meeting the investment grade

equivalent criteria of our internal credit rating
classification at Sept. 30, 2022. In addition, 66% of the
financial institutions exposure is secured. For example,
securities industry clients and asset managers often borrow
against marketable securities held in custody. The exposure
to financial institutions is generally short-term, with 84%
expiring within one year.

Wealth management loans

Wealth management loans are not typically rated by
external rating agencies. A majority of the wealth
management loans are secured by the customers’
investment management accounts or custody accounts.
Eligible assets pledged for these loans are typically
investment grade fixed-income securities, equities and/or
mutual funds. Internal ratings for this portion of the wealth
management loan portfolio, therefore, would equate to
investment grade external ratings. Wealth management
loans are provided to select customers based on the pledge
of other types of assets. For the loans collateralized by
other assets, the credit quality of the obligor is carefully
analyzed,

70 BNY Mellon

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

but we do not consider this portion of wealth management
loan portfolio to be investment grade.

Wealth management mortgages

Credit quality indicators for wealth management mortgages
are not correlated to external ratings. Wealth management
mortgages are typically loans to high-net-worth
individuals, which are secured primarily by residential
property. These loans are primarily interest-only, adjustable
rate mortgages with a weighted-average loan-to-value ratio
of 61% at origination. Delinquency rate is a key indicator
of credit quality in the wealth management portfolio. At
Sept. 30, 2022, less than 1% of the mortgages were past
due.

At Sept. 30, 2022, the wealth management mortgage
portfolio consisted of the following geographic
concentrations: California – 21%; New York – 15%;
Florida – 11%; Massachusetts – 8%; and other – 45%.

Lease financings

At Sept. 30, 2022, the lease financings portfolio consisted
of exposures backed by well-diversified assets, primarily
real estate and large-ticket transportation equipment. The
largest components of our lease residual value exposure
relate to aircraft and freight-related rail cars. Assets are
both domestic and foreign-based, with primary
concentrations in Germany and the U.S.

Other residential mortgages

The other residential mortgages portfolio primarily consists
of 1-4 family residential mortgage loans and totaled $356
million at Sept. 30, 2022 and $299 million at Dec. 31,
2021. Included in this portfolio at Sept. 30, 2022 were $94
million of fixed-rate jumbo mortgage loans purchased in
the second quarter of

2022 with a weighted-average loan-to-value ratio of 69%
at origination. These loans are not typically correlated to
external ratings.

Capital call financing

Capital call financing includes loans to private equity funds
that are secured by the fund investors’ capital commitments
and the funds’ right to call capital.

Other loans

Other loans primarily include loans to consumers that are
fully collateralized with equities, mutual funds and fixed-
income securities.

Margin loans

We had $17.7 billion of secured margin loans at Sept. 30,
2022, compared with $22.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2021.
Margin loans are collateralized with marketable securities,
and borrowers are required to maintain a daily collateral
margin in excess of 100% of the value of the loan. We have
rarely suffered a loss on these types of loans.

Overdrafts

Overdrafts primarily relate to custody and securities
clearance clients and totaled $5.1 billion at Sept. 30, 2022
and $3.1 billion at Dec. 31, 2021. Overdrafts occur on a
daily basis and are generally repaid within two business
days.

Reverse repurchase agreements

Reverse repurchase agreements at Sept. 30, 2022 and Dec.
31, 2021 were fully secured with high-quality collateral. As
a result, there was no allowance for credit losses related to
these assets at Sept. 30, 2022 and Dec. 31, 2021.

Goodwill impairment testing

The goodwill impairment test is performed at least
annually at the reporting unit level. BNY Mellon’s business
segments include six reporting units for which goodwill
impairment testing is performed. As a result of the annual
goodwill impairment test conducted in the second quarter
of 2022, no goodwill impairment was recognized.

An interim test is performed when events or circumstances
occur that may indicate that it is more likely than not that
the fair value of any reporting unit may be less than its
carrying value.

In the third quarter 2022, due to decreases in market values
and the related outlook as well as increased market interest
rates, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test of
the Investment Management reporting unit which had $7.0
billion of allocated goodwill. The fair value of the
Investment Management reporting unit was determined to
be 7% below its carrying value, resulting in a goodwill
impairment charge of $680 million. This goodwill
impairment represents a non-cash charge and did not

affect BNY Mellon’s liquidity position, tangible common
equity or regulatory capital ratios. We determined it was
not necessary to perform an interim goodwill impairment
test for our other reporting units.

We determined the fair value of the Investment
Management reporting unit using an income approach
based on management’s projections as of Sept 30, 2022.
The discount rate applied to these cash flows was 10.5%
compared with the 10% discount rate used in the annual
impairment test conducted in the second quarter of 2022.
The increase was driven by a higher risk free rate.
Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is subject to
uncertainty as it is reliant on estimates of cash flows that
extend far into the future, and, by their nature, are difficult
to estimate over such an extended time frame. The cash
flow estimates for the Investment Management reporting
unit are impacted by projections of the level and mix of
assets under management, market values, operating
margins and long-term growth rates. In the future, changes
in the assumptions or the discount rate could produce a
material non-cash goodwill impairment.

Non-readily marketable equity securities do not have
readily determinable fair values. These investments are
valued using a measurement alternative where the
investments are carried at cost, less any impairment, and
plus or minus changes resulting from observable price
changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar
investment of the same issuer. The observable price
changes are recorded in investment and other revenue on
the consolidated income statement. Our non-readily
marketable equity securities totaled $434 million at Sept.

fund future investments in qualified affordable housing
projects totaled $595 million at Sept. 30, 2022 and $543

Investments valued using net asset value (“NAV”) per
share

In our Investment and Wealth Management business
segment, we make seed capital investments in certain
funds we manage. We also hold private equity investments,
primarily small business investment companies (“SBICs”),
which are compliant with the Volcker Rule, and certain
other corporate investments. Seed capital, private equity
and other

corporate investments are included in other assets on the
consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of certain of
these investments was estimated using the

NAV per share for our ownership interest in the funds.

The table below presents information on our investments valued using NAV.

(a)    Primarily includes leveraged loans and structured credit funds, which are generally not redeemable. Distributions from such investments will be
received as the underlying investments in the funds, which have lives of three to 11 years at both Sept. 30, 2022 and Dec. 31, 2021, are liquidated.

(b)    Includes investments in funds that relate to deferred compensation arrangements with employees.
(c)    Private equity investments primarily include Volcker Rule-compliant investments in SBICs that invest in various sectors of the economy. Private equity
investments do not have redemption rights. Distributions from such investments will be received as the underlying investments in the private equity
investments, which have a life of 10 years, are liquidated.

Note 8–Contract revenue

Fee and other revenue in the Securities Services, Market
and Wealth Services and Investment and Wealth
Management business segments is primarily variable,
based on levels of assets under custody and/or
administration, assets under management and the level of
client-driven transactions, as specified in fee schedules.
See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements in our 2021 Annual Report for information on
the nature of our services and revenue recognition. See
Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
in our 2021 Annual Report for additional information on
our principal business segments, Securities Services,

Market and Wealth Services and Investment and Wealth
Management, and the primary services provided.

Disaggregation of contract revenue

Contract revenue is included in fee and other revenue on
the consolidated income statement. The following tables
present fee and other revenue related to contracts with
customers, disaggregated by type of fee revenue, for each
business segment. Business segment data has been
determined on an internal management basis of accounting,
rather than GAAP, which is used for consolidated financial
reporting.

Contract balances

Contract costs

Our clients are billed based on fee schedules that are
agreed upon in each customer contract. Receivables from
customers were $2.5 billion at Sept. 30, 2022 and Dec. 31,
2021.

Contract assets represent accrued revenues that have not
yet been billed to the customers due to certain contractual
terms other than the passage of time and were $68 million
at Sept. 30, 2022 and $42 million at Dec. 31, 2021.
Accrued revenues recorded as contract assets are usually
billed on an annual basis.

Both receivables from customers and contract assets are
included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.

Contract liabilities represent payments received in advance
of providing services under certain contracts and were
$182 million at Sept. 30, 2022 and $163 million at Dec. 31,
2021. Contract liabilities are included in other liabilities on
the consolidated balance sheet. Revenue recognized in the
third quarter of 2022 relating to contract liabilities as of
June 30, 2022 was $71 million. Revenue recognized in the
first nine months of 2022 relating to contract liabilities as
of Dec. 31, 2021 was $106 million.

Changes in contract assets and liabilities primarily relate to
either party’s performance under the contracts.

Incremental costs for obtaining contracts that are deemed
recoverable are capitalized as contract costs. Such costs
result from the payment of sales incentives, primarily in
the Wealth Management business, and totaled $57 million
at Sept. 30, 2022 and $64 million at Dec. 31, 2021.
Capitalized sales incentives are amortized based on the
transfer of goods or services to which the assets relate and
typically average nine years. The amortization of
capitalized sales incentives, which is primarily included in
staff expense on the consolidated income statement, totaled
$5 million in the third quarter of 2022 and third quarter of
2021, $4 million in the second quarter of 2022, $14 million
in the first nine months of 2022 and $15 million in the first
nine months of 2021.

Costs to fulfill a contract are capitalized when they relate
directly to an existing contract or a specific anticipated
contract, generate or enhance resources that will be used to
fulfill performance obligations, and are recoverable. Such
costs generally represent set-up costs, which include any
direct cost incurred at the inception of a contract which
enables the fulfillment of the performance obligation, and
totaled $25 million at Sept. 30, 2022 and $23 million at
Dec. 31, 2021. These capitalized costs are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the expected contract period, which
generally ranges from seven to nine years. The
amortization is included in professional, legal and other
purchased services and other expenses on the

million in the third quarter of 2022, third quarter of 2021
and second quarter of 2022 and $1 million in the first nine

Unsatisfied performance obligations

We do not have any unsatisfied performance obligations
other than those that are subject to a

practical expedient election under ASC 606, Revenue From
Contracts With Customers. The practical expedient election
applies to (i) contracts with an original expected length of

revenue at the amount to which we have the right to
invoice for services performed.

Note 11–Income taxes

BNY Mellon recorded an income tax provision of $242
million (38.4% effective tax rate) in the third quarter of
2022, which includes approximately 19% impact due to the
goodwill impairment. The income tax provision was $219
million (18.8% effective tax rate) in the third quarter of
2021 and $231 million (21.1% effective tax rate) in the
second quarter of 2022.

Our total tax reserves as of Sept. 30, 2022 were $130
million compared with $138 million at Dec. 31, 2021. If
these tax reserves were unnecessary, $130 million would
affect the effective tax rate in future periods. We recognize
accrued interest and penalties, if applicable, related to
income taxes in income tax expense. Included in the
balance sheet at Sept. 30,

2022 is accrued interest, where applicable, of $38 million.
The additional tax expense related to interest for the nine
months ended Sept. 30, 2022 was $3 million, compared
with $6 million for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2021.

It is reasonably possible the total reserve for uncertain tax
positions could decrease within the next 12 months by
approximately $12 million as a result of adjustments
related to tax years that are still subject to examination.

Our federal income tax returns are closed to examination
through 2016. Our New York State income tax returns are
closed to examination through 2014. Our New York City
income tax returns are closed to examination through 2012.
Our UK income tax returns are closed to examination
through 2019.

Note 12–Variable interest entities

Consolidated investment management funds

We have variable interests in variable interest entities
(“VIEs”), which include investments in retail, institutional
and alternative investment funds, including CLO structures
in which we provide asset management services, some of
which are consolidated.

We earn management fees from these funds, as well as
performance fees in certain funds, and may also provide
start-up capital for new funds. The funds are primarily
financed by our customers’ investments in the funds’ equity
or debt.

Additionally, we invest in qualified affordable housing and
renewable energy projects, which are designed to generate
a return primarily through the realization of tax credits.
The projects, which are structured as limited partnerships
and limited liability companies, are also VIEs, but are not
consolidated.

The following table presents the incremental assets and
liabilities included in the consolidated balance sheet as of
Sept. 30, 2022 and Dec. 31, 2021. The net assets of any
consolidated VIE are solely available to settle the liabilities
of the VIE and to settle any
investors’ ownership liquidation requests, including any
seed capital we invested in the VIE.

We have not provided financial or other support that was
not otherwise contractually required to be provided to our
VIEs. Additionally, creditors of any consolidated VIEs do
not have any recourse to the general credit of BNY Mellon.

Non-consolidated VIEs

As of Sept. 30, 2022 and Dec. 31, 2021, the following
assets and liabilities related to the VIEs where we are not

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Note 15–Fair value measurement

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to
sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the
measurement date. A three-level hierarchy for fair value
measurements is utilized based upon the transparency of
inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the
measurement date. BNY Mellon’s own creditworthiness is
considered when valuing liabilities. See Note 20 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2021
Annual Report for

information on how we determine fair value and the fair
value hierarchy.

The following tables present the financial instruments
carried at fair value at Sept. 30, 2022 and Dec. 31, 2021,
by caption on the consolidated balance sheet and by the
three-level valuation hierarchy. We have included credit
ratings information in certain of the tables because the
information indicates the degree of credit risk to which we
are exposed, and significant changes in ratings
classifications could result in increased risk for us.

prices for similar assets or liabilities. Quoted prices for
either identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive
markets may also be used. Accordingly, fair value best
reflects the interests BNY Mellon holds in the economic
performance of the consolidated investment management
funds. Changes in the fair value of the assets and liabilities
are recorded as income (loss) from consolidated
investment management funds, which is included in
investment and other revenue in the consolidated income
statement.

We elected the fair value option on subordinated notes
associated with certain equity investments. The fair value
of these subordinated notes was $10 million at Sept. 30,
2022 and $15 million at Dec. 31, 2021. The subordinated
notes were valued using observable market inputs and
included in Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.

Note 17–Derivative instruments

We use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk,
including interest rate risk, equity price risk and foreign
currency risk, as well as credit risk. Our trading activities
are focused on acting as a market-maker for our customers
and facilitating customer trades in compliance with the
Volcker Rule.

The notional amounts for derivative financial instruments
express the dollar volume of the transactions; however,
credit risk is much smaller. We perform credit reviews and
enter into netting

agreements and collateral arrangements to minimize the
credit risk of derivative financial instruments. We enter
into offsetting positions to reduce exposure to foreign
currency, interest rate and equity price risk.

Use of derivative financial instruments involves reliance
on counterparties. Failure of a counterparty to honor its
obligation under a derivative contract is a risk we assume
whenever we engage in a derivative contract. There were
no counterparty default losses recorded in the third quarter
of 2022.

Hedging derivatives

We utilize interest rate swap agreements to manage our
exposure to interest rate fluctuations. We enter into fair
value hedges as an interest rate risk management strategy
to reduce fair value variability by converting certain fixed
rate interest payments associated with available-for-sale
securities and long-term debt to floating interest rates. We
also utilize interest rate swaps and forward exchange
contracts as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to
interest rate and foreign exchange rate changes.

The available-for-sale securities hedged consist of U.S.
Treasury, agency and non-agency commercial MBS,
sovereign debt/sovereign guaranteed, state and political
subdivisions, corporate bonds and foreign covered bonds.
At Sept. 30, 2022, $32.6 billion par value of available-for-
sale securities were hedged with interest rate swaps
designated as fair value hedges that had notional values of
$32.6 billion.

The fixed rate long-term debt instruments hedged generally
have original maturities of five to 30 years. In fair value
hedging relationships, fixed rate debt is hedged with
“receive fixed rate, pay variable rate” swaps. At Sept. 30,
2022, $22.9 billion par value of debt was hedged with
interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges that had
notional values of $22.9 billion.

In addition, we utilize forward foreign exchange contracts
as hedges to mitigate foreign exchange exposures. We use
forward foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges to
convert certain forecasted non-U.S. dollar revenue and
expenses into

U.S. dollars. We use forward foreign exchange contracts
with maturities of 12 months or less as cash flow hedges to
hedge our foreign exchange exposure to currencies such as
Indian rupee, British pound, euro, Hong Kong dollar,
Polish zloty and Singapore dollar used in revenue and
expense transactions for entities that have the U.S. dollar
as their functional currency. As of Sept. 30, 2022, the
hedged forecasted foreign currency transactions and
designated forward foreign exchange contract hedges were
$407 million (notional), with a net pre-tax loss of $9
million recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
income (“OCI”). This loss will be reclassified to earnings
over the next 12 months.

We also utilize forward foreign exchange contracts as fair
value hedges of the foreign exchange risk associated with
available-for-sale securities. Forward points are designated
as an excluded component and amortized into earnings
over the hedge period. The unamortized derivative value
associated with the excluded component is recognized in
accumulated OCI. At Sept. 30, 2022, $110 million par
value of available-for-sale securities was hedged with
foreign currency forward contracts that had a notional
value of $110 million.

Forward foreign exchange contracts are also used to hedge
the value of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
These forward foreign exchange contracts have maturities
of less than one year. The derivatives employed are
designated as hedges of changes in value of our foreign
investments due to exchange rates. The change in fair
market value of these forward foreign exchange contracts
is reported within foreign currency translation adjustments
in shareholders’ equity, net of tax. At Sept. 30, 2022,
forward foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts
totaling $8.1 billion were designated as net investment
hedges.

From time to time, we also designate non-derivative
financial instruments as hedges of our net investments in
foreign subsidiaries. At Sept. 30, 2022, there were no non-
derivative financial instruments hedging our net
investments in foreign subsidiaries.

trading in cash instruments, including fixed income and
equity securities, and

trading and economic hedging activity with non-foreign
exchange derivatives.

We also use derivative financial instruments as risk-
mitigating economic hedges, which are not formally
designated as accounting hedges. This includes hedging the
foreign currency, interest rate or market risks inherent in
some of our balance sheet exposures, such as seed capital
investments and deposits, as well as certain investment
management fee revenue streams. We also use total return
swaps to economically hedge obligations arising from the
Company’s deferred compensation plan whereby the
participants defer compensation and earn a return linked to
the performance of investments they select. The gains or
losses on these total return swaps are recorded in staff
expense on the consolidated income statement and were
losses of $11 million in the third quarter of 2022, $2
million in the third quarter of 2021, $30 million in the
second quarter of 2022 and $54 million in the first nine
months of 2022 and a gain of $21 million in the first nine
months of 2021.

We manage trading risk through a system of position
limits, a value-at-risk (“VaR”) methodology based on
historical simulation and other market sensitivity

BNY Mellon 91

 
 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

measures. Risk is monitored and reported to senior
management by a separate unit, independent from trading,
on a daily basis. Based on certain assumptions, the VaR
methodology is designed to capture the potential overnight
pre-tax dollar loss from adverse changes in fair values of
all trading positions. The calculation assumes a one-day
holding period, utilizes a 99% confidence level and
incorporates non-linear product characteristics. The VaR
model is one of several statistical models used to develop
economic capital results, which are allocated to lines of
business for computing risk-adjusted performance.

The VaR methodology does not evaluate risk attributable to
extraordinary financial, economic or other occurrences. As
a result, the risk assessment process includes a number of
stress scenarios based upon the risk factors in the portfolio
and management’s assessment of market conditions.
Additional stress scenarios based upon historical market
events are also performed. Stress tests may incorporate the
impact of reduced market liquidity and the breakdown of
historically observed correlations and extreme scenarios.
VaR and other statistical measures, stress testing and
sensitivity analysis are incorporated into other risk
management materials.

Counterparty credit risk and collateral

We assess the credit risk of our counterparties through
regular examination of their financial statements,
confidential communication with the management of those
counterparties and regular monitoring of publicly available
credit rating information. This and other information is
used to develop proprietary credit rating metrics used to
assess credit quality.

Collateral requirements are determined after a
comprehensive review of the credit quality of each
counterparty. Collateral is generally held or pledged in the
form of cash and/or highly liquid government securities.
Collateral requirements are monitored and adjusted daily.

Additional disclosures concerning derivative financial
instruments are provided in Note 15.

Disclosure of contingent features in over-the-counter
(“OTC”) derivative instruments

Certain OTC derivative contracts and/or collateral
agreements contain credit risk-contingent features
triggered upon a rating downgrade in which the
counterparty has the right to request additional collateral or
the right to terminate the contracts in a net liability
position.

The following table shows the aggregate fair value of OTC
derivative contracts in net liability positions that contained
credit risk-contingent features and the value of collateral
that has been posted.

The aggregate fair value of OTC derivative contracts

The Bank of New York Mellon, our largest banking
subsidiary, enters into the substantial majority of our OTC
derivative contracts and/or collateral agreements. As such,
the contingent features may be triggered if The Bank of
New York Mellon’s long-term issuer rating were
downgraded.

If The Bank of New York Mellon’s debt rating had fallen

have required us to post additional collateral of $253
million and $71 million, respectively.

BNY Mellon’s repurchase agreements and securities
lending transactions primarily encounter risk associated
with liquidity. We are required to pledge collateral based
on predetermined terms within the agreements. If we were
to experience a decline in the fair value of the collateral
pledged for these transactions, we could be required to
provide additional collateral to the counterparty, therefore
decreasing the amount of assets available for other
liquidity needs that may arise. BNY Mellon also offers tri-
party collateral agency services in the tri-party repo market
where we are exposed to credit risk. In order to mitigate
this risk, we require dealers to fully secure intra-day credit.

Note 18–Commitments and contingent liabilities

Off-balance sheet arrangements

In the normal course of business, various commitments and
contingent liabilities are outstanding that are not reflected
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Our significant trading and off-balance sheet risks are
securities, foreign currency and interest rate risk
management products, commercial lending commitments,
letters of credit and securities lending indemnifications. We
assume these risks to reduce interest rate and foreign
currency risks, to provide customers with the ability to
meet credit and liquidity needs and to hedge foreign
currency and interest rate risks. These items involve, to
varying degrees, credit, foreign currency and interest rate
risks not recognized on the balance sheet. Our off-balance
sheet risks are managed and monitored in manners similar
to those used for on-balance sheet risks.

acts as an agent on behalf of CIBC Mellon clients, which totaled
$71 billion at Sept. 30, 2022 and $67 billion at Dec. 31, 2021.
Includes cash collateral, invested in indemnified repurchase
agreements, held by us as securities lending agent of $50 billion at
Sept. 30, 2022 and $48 billion at Dec. 31, 2021.

(c)

The total potential loss on undrawn lending commitments,
standby and commercial letters of credit and securities
lending indemnifications is equal to the total notional
amount if drawn upon, which does not consider the value
of any collateral.

Since many of the lending commitments are expected to
expire without being drawn upon, the total amount does
not necessarily represent future cash requirements. A
summary of lending commitment maturities is as follows:
$29.8 billion in less than one year, $19.4 billion in one to
five years and $859 million over five years.

SBLCs principally support obligations of corporate clients
and were collateralized with cash and securities of $161
million at Sept. 30, 2022 and $172 million at Dec. 31,
2021. At Sept. 30, 2022, $1.4 billion of the SBLCs will
expire within one year, $621 million in one to five years
and none over five years.

We must recognize, at the inception of an SBLC and
foreign and other guarantees, a liability for the fair value of
the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The fair
value of the liability, which was recorded with a
corresponding asset in other assets, was estimated as the
present value of contractual customer fees. The estimated
liability for losses related to SBLCs and foreign and other
guarantees, if any, is included in the allowance for lending-
related commitments.

96 BNY Mellon

Payment/performance risk of SBLCs is monitored using
both historical performance and internal ratings criteria.
BNY Mellon’s historical experience is that SBLCs
typically expire without being funded. SBLCs below
investment grade are monitored closely for
payment/performance risk. The table below shows SBLCs
by investment grade:

Standby letters of credit

A commercial letter of credit is normally a short-term
instrument used to finance a commercial contract for the
shipment of goods from a seller to a buyer. Although the
commercial letter of credit is contingent upon the
satisfaction of specified conditions, it represents a credit
exposure if the buyer defaults on the underlying
transaction. As a result, the total contractual amounts do
not necessarily represent future cash requirements.
Commercial letters of credit totaled $46 million at Sept.
30, 2022 and $56 million at Dec. 31, 2021.

We expect many of the lending commitments and letters of
credit to expire without the need to advance any cash. The
revenue associated with guarantees frequently depends on
the credit rating of the obligor and the structure of the
transaction, including collateral, if any. The allowance for
lending-related commitments was $72 million at Sept. 30,
2022 and $45 million at Dec. 31, 2021.

A securities lending transaction is a fully collateralized
transaction in which the owner of a security agrees to lend
the security (typically through an agent, in our case, The
Bank of New York Mellon) to a borrower, usually a broker-
dealer or bank, on an open, overnight or term basis, under
the terms of a prearranged contract.

We typically lend securities with indemnification against
borrower default. We generally require the borrower to
provide collateral with a minimum value of 102% of the
fair value of the securities borrowed, which is monitored
on a daily basis, thus reducing credit risk. Market risk can
also arise in securities lending transactions. These risks are
controlled through policies limiting the level of risk that
can be undertaken. Securities lending transactions are
generally entered into only with highly rated

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

counterparties. Securities lending indemnifications were
secured by collateral of $506 billion at Sept. 30, 2022 and
$511 billion at Dec. 31, 2021.

CIBC Mellon, a joint venture between BNY Mellon and
the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (“CIBC”),
engages in securities lending activities.  CIBC Mellon,
BNY Mellon and CIBC jointly and severally indemnify
securities lenders against specific types of borrower
default. At Sept. 30, 2022 and Dec. 31, 2021, $71 billion
and $67 billion, respectively, of borrowings at CIBC
Mellon, for which BNY Mellon acts as agent on behalf of
CIBC Mellon clients, were secured by collateral of $76
billion and $71 billion, respectively. If, upon a default, a
borrower’s collateral was not sufficient to cover its related
obligations, certain losses related to the indemnification
could be covered by the indemnitors.

Unsettled repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements

In the normal course of business, we enter into repurchase
agreements and reverse repurchase agreements that settle
at a future date. In repurchase agreements, BNY Mellon
receives cash from and provides securities as collateral to a
counterparty at settlement. In reverse repurchase
agreements, BNY Mellon advances cash to and receives
securities as collateral from the counterparty at settlement.
These transactions are recorded on the consolidated
balance sheet on the settlement date. At Sept. 30, 2022, we
had $2.5 billion of unsettled repurchase agreements and
$6.1 billion of unsettled reverse repurchase agreements. At
Dec. 31, 2021, we had $2.6 billion of unsettled repurchase
agreements and $9.1 billion of unsettled reverse repurchase
agreements.

Sponsored member repo program

BNY Mellon is a sponsoring member in the FICC
sponsored member program, where we submit eligible
repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions in U.S.
Treasury and agency securities (“Sponsored Member
Transactions”) between BNY Mellon and our sponsored
member clients for novation and clearing through FICC
pursuant to the FICC Government Securities Division
rulebook (the “FICC Rules”). We also guarantee to FICC
the prompt and full payment and performance of our
sponsored member clients’ respective obligations under the
FICC Rules in connection with such clients’ Sponsored
Member Transactions. We minimize our credit exposure
under this guaranty by obtaining a security interest in our
sponsored member clients’ collateral and rights under
Sponsored Member Transactions. See “Offsetting assets
and liabilities” in Note 17 for additional information on our
repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements.

Indemnification arrangements

We have provided standard representations for
underwriting agreements, acquisition and divestiture
agreements, sales of loans and commitments, and other
similar types of arrangements and customary
indemnification for claims and legal proceedings

BNY Mellon 97

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

related to providing financial services that are not
otherwise included above. Insurance has been purchased to
mitigate certain of these risks. Generally, there are no
stated or notional amounts included in these
indemnifications and the contingencies triggering the
obligation for indemnification are not expected to occur.
Furthermore, often counterparties to these transactions
provide us with comparable indemnifications. We are
unable to develop an estimate of the maximum payout
under these indemnifications for several reasons. In
addition to the lack of a stated or notional amount in a
majority of such indemnifications, we are unable to predict
the nature of events that would trigger indemnification or
the level of indemnification for a certain event. We believe,
however, that the possibility that we will have to make any
material payments for these indemnifications is remote. At
Sept. 30, 2022 and Dec. 31, 2021, we have not recorded
any material liabilities under these arrangements.

Clearing and settlement exchanges

We are a noncontrolling equity investor in, and/or member
of, several industry clearing or settlement exchanges
through which foreign exchange, securities, derivatives or
other transactions settle. Certain of these industry clearing
and settlement exchanges require their members to
guarantee their obligations and liabilities and/or to provide
liquidity support in the event other members do not honor
their obligations. We believe the likelihood that a clearing
or settlement exchange (of which we are a member) would
become insolvent is remote. Additionally, certain
settlement exchanges have implemented loss allocation
policies that enable the exchange to allocate settlement
losses to the members of the exchange. It is not possible to
quantify such mark-to-market loss until the loss occurs.
Any ancillary costs that occur as a result of any mark-to-
market loss cannot be quantified. In addition, we also
sponsor clients as members on clearing and settlement
exchanges and guarantee their obligations. At Sept. 30,
2022 and Dec. 31, 2021, we did not record any material
liabilities under these arrangements.

Legal proceedings

In the ordinary course of business, The Bank of New York
Mellon Corporation and its subsidiaries are routinely
named as defendants in or made parties to pending and
potential legal actions. We also are subject to governmental
and regulatory examinations,

98 BNY Mellon

information-gathering requests, investigations and
proceedings (both formal and informal). Claims for
significant monetary damages are often asserted in many of
these legal actions, while claims for disgorgement,
restitution, penalties and/or other remedial actions or
sanctions may be sought in governmental and regulatory
matters. It is inherently difficult to predict the eventual
outcomes of such matters given their complexity and the
particular facts and circumstances at issue in each of these
matters. However, on the basis of our current knowledge
and understanding, we do not believe that judgments,
settlements or orders, if any, arising from these matters
(either individually or in the aggregate, after giving effect
to applicable reserves and insurance coverage) will have a
material adverse effect on the consolidated financial
position or liquidity of BNY Mellon, although they could
have a material effect on our results of operations in a
given period.

In view of the inherent unpredictability of outcomes in
litigation and regulatory matters, particularly where (i) the
damages sought are substantial or indeterminate, (ii) the
proceedings are in the early stages, or (iii) the matters
involve novel legal theories or a large number of parties, as
a matter of course there is considerable uncertainty
surrounding the timing or ultimate resolution of litigation
and regulatory matters, including a possible eventual loss,
fine, penalty or business impact, if any, associated with
each such matter. In accordance with applicable accounting
guidance, we establish accruals for litigation and
regulatory matters when those matters proceed to a stage
where they present loss contingencies that are both
probable and reasonably estimable. In such cases, there
may be a possible exposure to loss in excess of any
amounts accrued. We regularly monitor such matters for
developments that could affect the amount of the accrual,
and will adjust the accrual amount as appropriate. If the
loss contingency in question is not both probable and
reasonably estimable, we do not establish an accrual and
the matter continues to be monitored for any developments
that would make the loss contingency both probable and
reasonably estimable. We believe that our accruals for legal
proceedings are appropriate and, in the aggregate, are not
material to the consolidated financial position of BNY
Mellon, although future accruals could have a material
effect on the results of operations in a given period. In
addition, if we have the potential to recover a portion of an
estimated loss from a third party, we record a

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

receivable up to the amount of the accrual that is probable
of recovery.

For certain of those matters described here for which a loss
contingency may, in the future, be reasonably possible
(whether in excess of a related accrued liability or where
there is no accrued liability), BNY Mellon is currently
unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss. For
those matters described here where BNY Mellon is able to
estimate a reasonably possible loss, the aggregate range of
such reasonably possible loss is up to $520 million in
excess of the accrued liability (if any) related to those
matters. For matters where a reasonably possible loss is
denominated in a foreign currency, our estimate is adjusted
quarterly based on prevailing exchange rates. We do not
consider potential recoveries when estimating reasonably
possible losses.

The following describes certain judicial, regulatory and
arbitration proceedings involving BNY Mellon:

Mortgage-Securitization Trusts Proceedings
The Bank of New York Mellon has been named as a
defendant in a number of legal actions brought by MBS
investors alleging that the trustee has expansive duties
under the governing agreements, including the duty to
investigate and pursue breach of representation and
warranty claims against other parties to the MBS
transactions. Three actions commenced in December 2014,
December 2015 and February 2017 are pending in New
York federal court. In New York state court, seven actions
are pending: one case commenced in May 2016; three
related cases commenced in September 2021 and October
2022; and three related cases commenced in October 2021,
December 2021 and February 2022.

Matters Related to R. Allen Stanford
In late December 2005, Pershing LLC (“Pershing”)
became a clearing firm for Stanford Group Co. (“SGC”), a
registered broker-dealer that was part of a group of entities
ultimately controlled by R. Allen Stanford (“Stanford”).
Stanford International Bank, also controlled by Stanford,
issued certificates of deposit (“CDs”). Some investors
allegedly wired funds from their SGC accounts to purchase
CDs. In 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission
charged Stanford with operating a Ponzi scheme in
connection with the sale of CDs, and SGC was placed into
receivership. Alleged purchasers of CDs have filed two
putative class action proceedings against Pershing: one in
November 2009 in Texas federal

court, and one in May 2016 in New Jersey federal court.
On Nov. 5, 2021, the court dismissed the class action filed
in New Jersey and that matter has concluded. Three
lawsuits remain against Pershing in Louisiana and New
Jersey federal courts, which were filed in January 2010,
October 2015 and May 2016. The purchasers allege that
Pershing, as SGC’s clearing firm, assisted Stanford in a
fraudulent scheme and assert contractual, statutory and
common law claims. In March 2019, a group of investors
filed a putative class action against The Bank of New York
Mellon in New Jersey federal court, making the same
allegations as in the prior actions brought against Pershing.
On Nov. 12, 2021, the court dismissed the class action
against The Bank of New York Mellon and that matter is
on appeal. All the cases that have been brought in federal
court against Pershing have been consolidated in Texas
federal court for discovery purposes. Various alleged
Stanford CD purchasers asserted similar claims in
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”)
arbitration proceedings.

Brazilian Postalis Litigation
BNY Mellon Servicos Financeiros DTVM S.A.
(“DTVM”), a subsidiary that provides asset services in
Brazil, acts as administrator for certain investment funds in
which a public pension fund for postal workers called
Postalis-Instituto de Seguridade Social dos Correios e
Telégrafos (“Postalis”) invested. On Aug. 22, 2014,
Postalis sued DTVM in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil for losses
related to a Postalis fund for which DTVM is
administrator. Postalis alleges that DTVM failed to
properly perform duties, including to conduct due diligence
of and exert control over the manager. On March 12, 2015,
Postalis filed a lawsuit in Rio de Janeiro against DTVM
and BNY Mellon Administração de Ativos Ltda. (“Ativos”)
alleging failure to properly perform duties relating to
another fund of which DTVM is administrator and Ativos
is manager. On Dec. 14, 2015, Associacão dos
Profissionais dos Correios (“ADCAP”), a Brazilian postal
workers association, filed a lawsuit in São Paulo against
DTVM and other defendants alleging that DTVM
improperly contributed to Postalis investment losses. On
March 20, 2017, the lawsuit was dismissed without
prejudice, and ADCAP appealed. On Aug. 4, 2021, the
appellate court overturned the dismissal and sent the
lawsuit to a state lower court. On Dec. 17, 2015, Postalis
filed three lawsuits in Rio de Janeiro against DTVM and
Ativos alleging failure to properly perform duties with
respect to investments in several other funds.

BNY Mellon 99

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

On May 20, 2021, the court in one of those lawsuits
entered a judgment of approximately $3 million against
DTVM and Ativos. On Aug. 23, 2021, DTVM and Ativos
filed an appeal of the May 20 decision. On June 7, 2022,
the appellate court partially granted and partially denied
the appeal, reducing the judgment to approximately $2
million. DTVM and Ativos intend to file a further appeal.
On Aug. 24, 2022, the court dismissed one of the other
lawsuits. On Feb. 4, 2016, Postalis filed a lawsuit in
Brasilia against DTVM, Ativos and BNY Mellon Alocação
de Patrimônio Ltda. (“Alocação de Patrimônio”), an
investment management subsidiary, alleging failure to
properly perform duties and liability for losses with respect
to investments in various funds of which the defendants
were administrator and/or manager. On Jan. 16, 2018, the
Brazilian Federal Prosecution Service (“MPF”) filed a civil
lawsuit in São Paulo against DTVM alleging liability for
Postalis losses based on alleged failures to properly
perform certain duties as administrator to certain funds in
which Postalis invested or as controller of Postalis’s own
investment portfolio. On April 18, 2018, the court
dismissed the lawsuit without prejudice. On Aug. 4, 2021,
the appellate court overturned the dismissal and returned
the lawsuit to the lower court. On April 11, 2022, DTVM
appealed the Aug. 4 decision to Brazil’s Superior Court of
Justice. In addition, the Tribunal de Contas da União
(“TCU”), an administrative tribunal, has initiated three
proceedings with the purpose of determining liability for
losses to three investment funds administered by DTVM in
which Postalis was an investor. On Sept. 9, 2020, TCU
rendered a decision in one of the proceedings, finding
DTVM and two former Postalis directors jointly and
severally liable for approximately $50 million. TCU also
imposed on DTVM a fine of approximately $2 million.
DTVM’s administrative appeal of the decision was denied.
On Feb. 25, 2022, DTVM filed a lawsuit in Brazil federal
court in Brasilia seeking annulment of TCU’s decision and
an injunction preventing TCU from enforcing the
judgment. On Oct. 4, 2019, Postalis and another pension
fund filed a request for arbitration in São Paulo against
DTVM and Ativos alleging liability for losses to an
investment fund for which DTVM was administrator and
Ativos was manager. On March 26, 2021, DTVM and
Ativos filed a lawsuit challenging the decision rendered by
the Arbitration Court with respect to its jurisdiction over
the case. On Oct. 25, 2019, Postalis filed a lawsuit in Rio
de Janeiro against DTVM and Alocação de Patrimônio,
alleging liability

100 BNY Mellon

for losses in another fund for which DTVM was
administrator and Alocação de Patrimônio and Ativos were
managers. On May 9, 2022, the court found DTVM and
Alocação de Patrimônio jointly and severally liable for
approximately $20 million. On Aug. 12, 2022, DTVM and
Alocação de Patrimônio appealed the decision. On June 19,
2020, a lawsuit was filed in federal court in Rio de Janeiro
against DTVM, Postalis, and various other defendants
alleging liability against DTVM for certain Postalis losses
in an investment fund of which DTVM was administrator.
On Feb. 10, 2021, Postalis and another pension fund served
DTVM in a lawsuit filed in Rio de Janeiro, alleging
liability for losses in another investment fund for which
DTVM was administrator and the other defendant was
manager.

Brazilian Silverado Litigation
DTVM acts as administrator for the Fundo de Investimento
em Direitos Creditórios Multisetorial Silverado Maximum
(“Silverado Maximum Fund”), which invests in
commercial credit receivables. On June 2, 2016, the
Silverado Maximum Fund sued DTVM in its capacity as
administrator, along with Deutsche Bank S.A. - Banco
Alemão in its capacity as custodian and Silverado Gestão e
Investimentos Ltda. in its capacity as investment manager.
The Fund alleges that each of the defendants failed to
fulfill its respective duty, and caused losses to the Fund for
which the defendants are jointly and severally liable.

German Tax Matters
German authorities are investigating past “cum/ex”
trading, which involved the purchase of equity securities
on or shortly before the dividend date, but settled after that
date, potentially resulting in an unwarranted refund of
withholding tax. German authorities have taken the view
that past cum/ex trading may have resulted in tax
avoidance or evasion. European subsidiaries of BNY
Mellon have been informed by German authorities about
investigations into potential cum/ex trading by certain
third-party investment funds, where one of the subsidiaries
had acquired entities that served as depositary and/or fund
manager for those third-party investment funds. We have
received information requests from the authorities relating
to pre-acquisition activity and are cooperating fully with
those requests. In August 2019, the District Court of Bonn
ordered that one of these subsidiaries be joined as a
secondary party in connection with the prosecution of
unrelated individual defendants. Trial

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

commenced in September 2019. In March 2020, the court
stated that it would refrain from taking action against the
subsidiary in order to expedite the conclusion of the trial.
The court convicted the unrelated individual defendants,
and determined that the cum/ex trading activities of the
relevant third-party investment funds were unlawful. In
November and December 2020, we received secondary
liability notices from the German tax authorities totaling
approximately $150 million (at then-prevailing exchange
rates) related to pre-acquisition activity in various funds for
which the entities we acquired were depositary and/or fund
manager. We have appealed the notices. In connection with
the acquisition of the subject entities, we obtained an
indemnity for liabilities from the sellers that we intend to
pursue as necessary.

Note 19–Business segments

We have an internal information system that produces
performance data along product and service lines for our
three principal business segments and the Other segment.
The primary products and services and types of revenue for
our principal businesses and a description of the Other
segment are presented in Note 24 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2021 Annual
Report.

Business accounting principles

Our business data has been determined on an internal
management basis of accounting, rather than GAAP which
is used for consolidated financial reporting. These
measurement principles are designed so that reported
results of the businesses will track their economic
performance.

Business segment results are subject to reclassification
when organizational changes are made, or for refinements
in revenue and expense allocation methodologies.
Refinements are typically reflected on a prospective basis.
There were no reclassification or organization changes in
the third quarter of 2022.

The accounting policies of the businesses are the same as
those described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements in our 2021 Annual Report.

The results of our business segments are presented and
analyzed on an internal management reporting basis.

• Revenue amounts reflect fee and other revenue

generated by each business and include revenue for
services provided between the segments that are also
provided to third parties. Fee and other revenue
transferred between businesses under revenue transfer
agreements is included within other fees in each
segment.

• Revenues and expenses associated with specific client
bases are included in those businesses. For example,
foreign exchange activity associated with clients using
custody products is included in the Securities Services
segment.

• Net interest revenue is allocated to businesses based on
the yields on the assets and liabilities generated by each
business. We employ a funds transfer pricing system
that matches funds with the specific assets and liabilities
of each business based on their interest sensitivity and
maturity characteristics.

•

•

•

The provision for credit losses associated with the
respective credit portfolios is reflected in each segment.

Incentives expense related to restricted stock and RSUs
is allocated to the segments.

Support and other indirect expenses, including services
provided between segments that are not provided to
third parties or not subject to a revenue transfer
agreement, are allocated to the businesses based on
internally developed methodologies and reflected in
noninterest expense.

• Recurring FDIC expense is allocated to the businesses
based on average deposits generated within each
business.

•

Litigation expense is generally recorded in the business
in which the charge occurs.

• Management of the securities portfolio is a shared

service contained in the Other segment. As a result,
gains and losses associated with the valuation of the
securities portfolio are generally included in the Other
segment.

• Client deposits serve as the primary funding source for

our securities portfolio. We typically allocate all interest
revenue to the businesses generating the deposits.
Accordingly, accretion
