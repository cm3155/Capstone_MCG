Key third quarter 2023 events

Increase in cash dividend on common stock

In July, our Board of Directors approved a 14% increase in
the quarterly cash dividend on our common stock, from
$0.37 to $0.42 per share.

Highlights of third quarter 2023 results

Net income applicable to common shareholders was $956
million, or $1.22 per diluted common share, in the third
quarter of 2023, including the impact of notable items.
Notable items in the third quarter of 2023 include
severance expense and litigation reserves. Excluding
notable items, net income applicable to common
shareholders was $992 million (Non-GAAP), or $1.27
(Non-GAAP) per diluted common share, in the third
quarter of 2023. Net income applicable to common
shareholders was $319 million, or $0.39 per diluted
common share, in the third quarter of 2022, including the
impact of notable items. Notable items in the third quarter
of 2022 include goodwill impairment in the Investment
Management reporting unit, a disposal gain (reflected in
investment and other revenue), severance expense and
litigation reserves. Excluding notable items, net income
applicable to common shareholders was $983

million (Non-GAAP), or $1.21 (Non-GAAP) per diluted
common share, in the third quarter of 2022.

Metrics

The highlights below are based on the third quarter of 2023
compared with the third quarter of 2022, unless otherwise
noted.

• Total revenue of $4.4 billion increased 2%, primarily

reflecting:
• Fee revenue was flat, primarily reflecting higher

market values, net new business and the favorable
impact of a weaker U.S. dollar, partially offset by the
impact of the Alcentra divestiture, the mix of
cumulative AUM flows and lower foreign exchange
volatility and volumes. (See “Fee and other revenue”
beginning on page 6.)

• Net interest revenue increased 10%, primarily

reflecting higher interest rates, partially offset by
changes in balance sheet size and mix. (See “Net
interest revenue” on page 9.)

• Provision for credit losses was $3 million, compared
with a benefit of $30 million. (See “Consolidated
balance sheet review – Allowance for credit losses”
beginning on page 29.)

• Noninterest expense decreased 16%, primarily related

to the third quarter 2022 goodwill impairment
associated with the Investment Management reporting
unit. Excluding notable items, noninterest expense
increased 3% (Non-GAAP), primarily reflecting higher
investments and revenue-related expenses, and the
unfavorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar, as well as
the impact of inflation, partially offset by the favorable
impact of efficiency savings and the impact of the
Alcentra divestiture. (See “Noninterest expense” on
page 12.)

• Effective tax rate of 18.8%. (See “Income taxes” on

page 12.)

• Return on common equity (“ROE”) was 10.5% for the

third quarter of 2023.

• Return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) was
20.5% (Non-GAAP) for the third quarter of 2023.

See “Supplemental information – Explanation of GAAP
and Non-GAAP financial measures” beginning on page 43
for a reconciliation of these Non-GAAP measures.

• AUC/A of $45.7 trillion increased 8%, primarily

reflecting higher market values, client inflows, the
favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar and net new
business.

• AUM of $1.8 trillion increased 3%, primarily reflecting
the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar and higher
market values, partially offset by the divestiture of
Alcentra.

Capital and liquidity

• Our CET1 ratio calculated under the Advanced

Approaches was 11.4% at Sept. 30, 2023 and 11.1% at
June 30, 2023. The increase primarily reflects capital
generated through earnings and lower risk-weighted
assets (“RWAs”), partially offset by capital deployed
through common stock repurchases and dividends. (See
“Capital” beginning on page 36.)

• Tier 1 leverage was 6.1% at Sept. 30, 2023 and 5.7% at
June 30, 2023. The increase primarily reflects lower
average assets. (See “Capital” beginning on page 36.)

• Returned $783 million to common shareholders,

including $450 million of common share repurchases.

June 30, 2023 and $1.4 trillion at Sept. 30, 2022.

N/M – Not meaningful.

Fee revenue was flat compared with the third quarter of
2022 and the second quarter of 2023. Compared with the
third quarter of 2022, higher investment services fees were
offset by lower foreign exchange revenue and investment
management and performance fees. Compared with the
second quarter of 2023, lower investment services fees
were offset by higher investment management and
performance fees.

Investment and other revenue decreased $4 million
compared with the third quarter of 2022 and increased $16
million compared with the second quarter of 2023. The
decrease compared with the third quarter of 2022 primarily
reflects a disposal gain recorded in the third quarter of
2022, a strategic equity investment loss and net securities
losses, partially offset by debt extinguishment gains, higher
other trading revenue and improved seed capital results.
The increase compared with the second quarter of 2023
primarily reflects debt extinguishment gains and higher
other trading revenue, partially offset by strategic equity
investment losses and net securities losses.

Investment services fees

Investment services fees increased 3% compared with the
third quarter of 2022 and decreased 1% compared with the
second quarter of 2023. The increase compared with the
third quarter of 2022 primarily reflects higher market
values, higher clearance volumes and collateral
management balances and higher fees on sweep balances,
partially offset by lost business in Pershing. The decrease
compared with the second quarter of 2023 primarily
reflects lower Depositary Receipts revenue, partially offset
by higher fees on sweep balances and higher clearance
volumes and collateral management balances.

AUC/A totaled $45.7 trillion at Sept. 30, 2023, an increase
of 8% compared with Sept. 30, 2022, primarily reflecting
higher market values, client inflows, the favorable impact
of a weaker U.S. dollar and net new business. AUC/A
consisted of 34% equity securities and 66% fixed income
securities at Sept. 30, 2023, and 33% equity securities and
67% fixed income securities at Sept. 30, 2022.

See “Securities Services business segment” and “Market
and Wealth Services business segment” in “Review of
business segments” for additional details.

Investment management and performance fees

Financing-related fees

Investment management and performance fees decreased
3% compared with the third quarter of 2022 and increased
2% compared with the second quarter of 2023. The
decrease compared with the third quarter of 2022 primarily
reflects the impact of the Alcentra divestiture and the mix
of cumulative AUM flows, partially offset by higher
market values and performance fees. The increase
compared with the second quarter of 2023 primarily
reflects the timing of performance fees. Performance fees
were $30 million in the third quarter of 2023 and $10
million in the third quarter of 2022 and second quarter of
2023. On a constant currency basis (Non-GAAP),
investment management and performance fees decreased
5% compared with the third quarter of 2022. See
“Supplemental information – Explanation of GAAP and
Non-GAAP financial measures” beginning on page 43 for
the reconciliation of Non-GAAP measures.

AUM was $1.8 trillion at Sept. 30, 2023, an increase of 3%
compared with Sept. 30, 2022, primarily reflecting the
favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar and higher market
values, partially offset by the divestiture of Alcentra.

See “Investment and Wealth Management business
segment” in “Review of business segments” for additional
details regarding the drivers of investment management
and performance fees, AUM and AUM flows.

Foreign exchange revenue

Foreign exchange revenue is primarily driven by the
volume of client transactions and the spread realized on
these transactions, both of which are impacted by market
volatility, the impact of foreign currency hedging activities
and foreign currency remeasurement gain (loss). Foreign
exchange revenue decreased 24% compared with the third
quarter of 2022 and 3% compared with the second quarter
of 2023. The decrease compared with the third quarter of
2022 primarily reflects lower volatility and volumes.
Foreign exchange revenue is primarily reported in the
Securities Services business segment and, to a lesser
extent, in the Market and Wealth Services and Investment
and Wealth Management business segments and the Other
segment.

Financing-related fees, which are primarily reported in the
Market and Wealth Services and Securities Services
business segments, include capital market fees, loan
commitment fees and credit-related fees. Financing-related
fees increased 5% compared with the third quarter of 2022
and decreased 10% compared with the second quarter of
2023. The increase compared with the third quarter of 2022
primarily reflects higher fees on standby letters of credit
and commitments, partially offset by lower underwriting
fees. The decrease compared with the second quarter of
2023 primarily reflects lower underwriting fees.

Investment and other revenue

Investment and other revenue includes income or loss from
consolidated investment management funds, seed capital
gains or losses, other trading revenue or loss, renewable
energy investments losses, income from corporate and
bank-owned life insurance contracts, other investment
gains or losses, gains or losses from disposals, expense
reimbursements from our CIBC Mellon joint venture, other
income or loss and net securities gains or losses. The
income or loss from consolidated investment management
funds should be considered together with the net income or
loss attributable to noncontrolling interests, which reflects
the portion of the consolidated funds for which we do not
have an economic interest and is reflected below net
income as a separate line item on the consolidated income
statement. Other trading revenue or loss primarily includes
the impact of market-risk hedging activity related to our
seed capital investments in investment management funds,
non-foreign currency derivative and fixed income trading,
and other hedging activity. Investments in renewable
energy generate losses in investment and other revenue that
are more than offset by benefits and credits recorded to the
provision for income taxes. Other investment gains or
losses includes fair value changes of non-readily
marketable strategic equity, private equity and other
investments. Expense reimbursements from our CIBC
Mellon joint venture relate to expenses incurred by BNY
Mellon on behalf of the CIBC Mellon joint venture. Other
income includes various miscellaneous revenues.

(b)    Includes strategic equity, private equity and other investments.

The decrease in total investment and other revenue
compared with the third quarter of 2022 primarily reflects
a disposal gain recorded in the third quarter of 2022, a
strategic equity investment loss and net securities losses,
partially offset by debt extinguishment gains, higher other
trading revenue and improved seed capital results. The
increase compared with the second quarter of 2023
primarily reflects debt extinguishment gains and higher
other trading revenue, partially offset by strategic equity
investment losses and net securities losses.

Year-to-date 2023 compared with year-to-date 2022

Fee revenue decreased 1% compared with the first nine
months of 2022, primarily reflecting lower investment
management and performance fees and foreign exchange
revenue, partially offset by higher investment services fees.
The 8% decrease in investment management and
performance fees primarily reflects the impact of the
Alcentra divestiture, the mix of cumulative AUM flows
and

lower market values, partially offset by the abatement of
money market fee waivers and higher performance
fees. The 23% decrease in foreign exchange revenue
primarily reflects lower volatility and volumes. The 4%
increase in investment services fees primarily reflects the
abatement of money market fee waivers, the accelerated
amortization of deferred costs for depositary receipts
services related to Russia recorded in the first quarter of
2022, higher clearance volumes and collateral management
balances, net new business in Asset Servicing and higher
fees on sweep balances, partially offset by lower client
activity, and lost business in Pershing.

Investment and other revenue increased $11 million
compared with the first nine months of 2022, primarily
reflecting higher other trading revenue, improved seed
capital results and debt extinguishment gains, partially
offset by strategic equity investment gains recorded in the
first nine months of 2022, a disposal gain recorded in the
third quarter of 2022 and net securities losses.

N/M – Not meaningful.
bps – basis points.

Net interest revenue increased 10% compared with the
third quarter of 2022 and decreased 8% compared with the
second quarter of 2023. The increase compared with the
third quarter of 2022 primarily reflects higher interest
rates, partially offset by changes in balance sheet size and
mix. The decrease compared with the second quarter of
2023 primarily reflects changes in balance sheet size and
mix, partially offset by higher interest rates.

Net interest margin increased 13 basis points compared
with the third quarter of 2022 and decreased 2 basis points
compared with the second quarter of 2023. The changes
compared with the third quarter of 2022 and the second
quarter of 2023 primarily reflect the factors mentioned
above.

Average interest-earning assets decreased 4% compared
with the third quarter of 2022 and decreased 6% compared
with the second quarter of 2023. The decrease compared
with the third quarter of 2022 primarily reflects lower
securities and loan balances and interest-bearing deposits
with banks. The decrease was partially offset by higher
interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and
other central banks. The decrease compared with the

second quarter of 2023 primarily reflects lower interest-
bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central
banks, securities and interest-bearing deposits with banks.

Average non-U.S. dollar deposits comprised approximately
25% of our average total deposits in the third quarter of
2023. Approximately 45% of the average non-U.S. dollar
deposits in the third quarter of 2023 were euro-
denominated.

Year-to-date 2023 compared with year-to-date 2022

Net interest revenue increased 33% compared with the first
nine months of 2022, primarily driven by higher interest
rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. The
increase in the net interest margin primarily reflects the
factors mentioned above.

Average interest-earning assets decreased 4% compared
with the first nine months of 2022, primarily reflecting
lower securities and loan balances and interest-bearing
deposits with banks. The decrease was partially offset by
larger interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve
and other central banks.

quarter of 2023 and $35 billion for the third quarter of 2022. On a Non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of offsetting, the yield on federal funds sold and securities
purchased under resale agreements would have been 5.36% for the third quarter of 2023, 5.10% for the second quarter of 2023 and 2.21% for the third quarter of 2022.

On a Non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of offsetting, the rate on federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements would have been 5.26%

for the third quarter of 2023, 4.99% for the second quarter of 2023 and 2.11% for the third quarter of 2022. We believe providing the rates excluding the impact of netting

is useful to investors as it is more reflective of the actual rates earned and paid.

Total noninterest expense decreased 16% primarily related
to the third quarter 2022 goodwill impairment associated
with the Investment Management reporting unit. Excluding
notable items, noninterest expense increased 3% (Non-
GAAP) primarily reflecting higher investments and
revenue-related expenses, and the unfavorable impact of a
weaker U.S. dollar, as well as the impact of inflation,
partially offset by the favorable impact of efficiency
savings and the impact of the Alcentra divestiture. The
investments, net of savings, are primarily included in staff,
software and equipment, and professional, legal and other
purchased services expenses. Total noninterest expense
decreased 1% compared with the second quarter of 2023,
primarily reflecting the favorable impact of efficiency
savings and lower litigation reserves, partially offset by
higher investments, severance and revenue-related
expenses.

Income taxes

BNY Mellon recorded an income tax provision of $241
million (18.8% effective tax rate) in the third quarter of
2023. We recorded an income tax provision of $242
million in the third quarter of 2022. The effective tax rate
was 38.4% in the third quarter of 2022, or 19.5% (Non-
GAAP) excluding notable items, primarily goodwill
impairment. We recorded an income tax provision of $270
million (20.2% effective tax rate) in the second quarter of
2023. See “Supplemental information – Explanation of
GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures” beginning on
page 43 for the reconciliation of this Non-GAAP measure.
For additional information, see Note 11 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Review of business segments

We have an internal information system that produces
performance data along product and service lines for our
three principal business segments: Securities Services,
Market and Wealth Services and Investment and Wealth
Management, and the Other segment.

Business segment accounting principles

Our business segment data has been determined on an
internal management basis of accounting, rather than the
generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) used
for consolidated financial reporting. These measurement
principles are designed so that reported results of the
businesses will track their economic performance.

For information on the accounting principles of our
business segments, see Note 19 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. For information on the
primary products and services in each line of business, the
primary types of revenue by line of business and how our
business segments are presented and analyzed, see Note 24
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our
2022 Annual Report.

Business segment results are subject to reclassification
when organizational changes are made, or for refinements
in revenue and expense allocation methodologies.
Refinements are typically reflected on a prospective basis.
There were no reclassification or organizational changes in
the third quarter of 2023.

The results of our business segments may be influenced by
client and other activities that vary by quarter. In the first
quarter, staff expense typically increases, reflecting the
vesting of long-term stock awards for retirement-eligible
employees. In the second quarter, staff expense typically
increases, reflecting the annual employee merit increase. In
the

Securities Services business segment

third quarter, volume-related fees may decline due to
reduced client activity. In the fourth quarter, we typically
incur higher business development and marketing
expenses. In our Investment and Wealth Management
business segment, performance fees are typically higher in
the fourth and first quarters, as those quarters represent the
end of the measurement period for many of the
performance fee-eligible relationships.

The results of our business segments may also be impacted
by the translation of financial results denominated in
foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar. We are primarily
impacted by activities denominated in the British pound
and the euro. On a consolidated basis and in our Securities
Services and Market and Wealth Services business
segments, we typically have more foreign currency-
denominated expenses than revenues. However, our
Investment and Wealth Management business segment
typically has more foreign currency-denominated revenues
than expenses. Overall, currency fluctuations impact the
year-over-year growth rate in the Investment and Wealth
Management business segment more than the Securities
Services and Market and Wealth Services business
segments. However, currency fluctuations, in isolation, are
not expected to significantly impact net income on a
consolidated basis.

Fee revenue in the Investment and Wealth Management
business segment, and, to a lesser extent, the Securities
Services and Market and Wealth Services business
segments, is impacted by global market fluctuations. At
Sept. 30, 2023, we estimated that a 5% change in global
equity markets, spread evenly throughout the year, would
impact fee revenue by less than 1% and diluted earnings
per common share by $0.04 to $0.07.

See Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for the consolidating schedules, which show the
contribution of our business segments to our overall
profitability.

Business segment description

The Securities Services business segment consists of two
distinct lines of business, Asset Servicing and Issuer
Services, which provide business solutions across the
transaction life cycle to our global asset owner and asset
manager clients. We are one of the leading global
investment services providers with $32.3 trillion of AUC/A
at Sept. 30, 2023. For

information on the drivers of the Securities Services fee
revenue, see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements in our 2022 Annual Report.

The Asset Servicing business provides a comprehensive
suite of solutions. We are one of the largest global custody
and front-to-back outsourcing partners. We offer services
for the safekeeping of assets in capital markets globally, as
well as fund

14 BNY Mellon

accounting services, exchange-traded funds servicing,
transfer agency, trust and depository, front-to-back
capabilities as well as data and analytics solutions for our
clients. We deliver foreign exchange, and securities lending
and financing solutions, on both an agency and principal
basis. Our agency securities lending program is one of the

Review of financial results

AUC/A of $32.3 trillion increased 8% compared with
Sept. 30, 2022, primarily reflecting higher market values
and the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar.

Total revenue of $2.1 billion increased 1% compared
with the third quarter of 2022 and decreased 7%
compared with the second quarter of 2023. The drivers of
total revenue by line of business are indicated below.

Asset Servicing revenue of $1.6 billion was flat
compared with the third quarter of 2022 and decreased
7% compared with the second quarter of 2023. The
comparison with the third quarter of 2022 primarily
reflects a third quarter 2022 disposal gain, lower foreign
exchange revenue and a strategic equity investment loss,
partially offset by higher net interest revenue and market
values and net new business. The decrease compared
with the second quarter of 2023 primarily reflects lower
net

Market and Wealth Services business segment

interest revenue, lower foreign exchange revenue and a
strategic equity investment loss.

Issuer Services revenue of $496 million increased 4%
compared with the third quarter of 2022 and decreased
7% compared with the second quarter of 2023. The
increase compared with the third quarter of 2022
primarily reflects higher net interest revenue. The
decrease compared with the second quarter of 2023
primarily reflects lower Depositary Receipts revenue.

Market and regulatory trends are driving investable
assets toward lower fee asset management products at
reduced margins for our clients. These dynamics are also
negatively impacting our investment services fees.
However, at the same time, these trends are providing
additional outsourcing opportunities as clients and other
market participants seek to comply with regulations and
reduce their operating costs.

Noninterest expense of $1.6 billion increased 2%
compared with the third quarter of 2022 and was flat
compared with the second quarter of 2023. The increase
compared with the third quarter of 2022 primarily
reflects higher investments and the impact of inflation,
partially offset by the favorable impact of efficiency
savings.

Year-to-date 2023 compared with year-to-date 2022

Total revenue of $6.4 billion increased 10% compared with
the first nine months of 2022. Asset Servicing revenue of
$5.0 billion increased 7%, primarily reflecting higher net
interest revenue, net new business and the abatement of
money market fee waivers, partially offset by lower foreign
exchange revenue and client activity, and a third quarter
2022 disposal gain. Issuer Services revenue of $1.5 billion
increased 22%, primarily reflecting higher net interest
revenue, the accelerated amortization of deferred costs for
depositary receipts services related to Russia recorded in
the first quarter of 2022 and the abatement of money
market fee waivers.

Noninterest expense of $4.7 billion was unchanged
compared with the first nine months of 2022, primarily
reflecting the favorable impact of efficiency savings and
lower litigation reserves, partially offset by higher
investments as well as the impact of inflation.

of three distinct lines of business, Pershing,

16 BNY Mellon

Treasury Services and Clearance and Collateral
Management, which provide business services and
technology solutions to entities including financial
institutions, corporations, foundations and

endowments, public funds and government agencies. For
information on the drivers of the Market and Wealth
Services fee revenue, see Note 10 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2022 Annual

and technology solutions, delivering operational support to

Our Treasury Services business is a leading provider of
global payments, liquidity management and trade finance
services for financial institutions, corporations and the
public sector.

Our Clearance and Collateral Management business
clears and settles equity and fixed income transactions
globally and serves as custodian for tri-party repo
collateral worldwide. We are the primary provider of
U.S. government securities clearance and a provider of

Review of financial results

AUC/A of $13.1 trillion increased 9% compared with Sept.
30, 2022, primarily reflecting net client inflows and higher
market values.

Total revenue of $1.4 billion increased 6% compared with
the third quarter of 2022 and was unchanged compared
with the second quarter of 2023. The drivers of total
revenue by line of business are indicated below.

Pershing revenue of $699 million increased 6% compared
with the third quarter of 2022 and 2% compared with the
second quarter of 2023. The increase compared with the
third quarter of 2022 primarily reflects higher net interest
revenue and higher fees on sweep balances, partially offset
by lost

business. The increase compared with the second quarter of
2023 primarily reflects higher fees on sweep balances.

Treasury Services revenue of $389 million was flat
compared with the third quarter of 2022 and decreased 3%
compared with the second quarter of 2023. The decrease
compared with the second quarter of 2023 primarily
reflects lower net interest revenue.

Clearance and Collateral Management revenue of $357
million increased 12% compared with the third quarter of
2022 and was unchanged compared with the second
quarter of 2023. The increase compared with the third
quarter of 2022 primarily reflects higher clearance volumes
and collateral management balances. Compared with the
second quarter of 2023, higher clearance volumes and
collateral management balances were offset by lower net
interest revenue.

Noninterest expense of $808 million increased 10%
compared with the third quarter of 2022 and 3% compared
with the second quarter of 2023. The increases primarily
reflect higher investments and revenue-related expenses, as
well as the impact of inflation, partially offset by the
favorable impact of efficiency savings.

Year-to-date 2023 compared with year-to-date 2022

Total revenue of $4.4 billion increased 12% compared with
the first nine months of 2022. Pershing revenue of $2.1
billion increased 11%, primarily reflecting the abatement
of money market fee waivers, higher net interest revenue
and higher fees on sweep balances, partially offset by
lower client activity and lost business. Treasury Services
revenue of $1.2 billion increased 9%, primarily reflecting
higher net interest revenue. Clearance and Collateral
Management revenue of $1.1 billion increased 17%,
primarily reflecting higher net interest revenue, U.S.
collateral management balances and U.S. government
clearance volumes.

Noninterest expense of $2.4 billion increased 10%
compared with the first nine months of 2022, primarily
reflecting higher investments and revenue-related
expenses, as well as the impact of inflation, partially offset
by the favorable impact of efficiency savings.

Business segment description

Our Investment and Wealth Management business segment
consists of two distinct lines of business: Investment
Management and Wealth Management. Our investment
firms deliver a highly diversified portfolio of investment
strategies independently, and through our global
distribution network, to institutional and retail clients
globally. BNY Mellon Wealth Management provides
investment management, custody, wealth and estate
planning, private banking services, investment servicing
and information management. See pages 19 and 20 of our
2022 Annual Report for additional information on our
Investment and Wealth Management business segment.

Review of financial results

AUM increased 3% compared with Sept. 30, 2022,
primarily reflecting the favorable impact of a weaker

third quarter of 2022 primarily reflects the impact of the
Alcentra divestiture and the mix of cumulative AUM
flows, partially offset by higher performance fees and
market values, and the favorable impact of a weaker U.S.
dollar. The increase compared with the second quarter of
2023 primarily reflects the timing of performance fees.

Wealth Management revenue of $270 million decreased
5% compared with the third quarter of 2022 and increased
1% compared with the second quarter of 2023. The
decrease compared with the third quarter of 2022 primarily
reflects lower net interest revenue and changes in product
mix, partially offset by higher market values. The increase
compared with the second quarter of 2023 primarily
reflects higher market values.

Revenue generated in the Investment and Wealth
Management business segment included 33% from non-
U.S. sources in the third quarter of 2023, compared with
33% in the third quarter of 2022 and 30% in the second
quarter of 2023.

Noninterest expense of $672 million decreased 50%
compared with the third quarter of 2022 and 1% compared
with the second quarter of 2023. The decrease compared
with the third quarter of 2022

Other segment

U.S. dollar and higher market values, partially offset by the
divestiture of Alcentra.

Net long-term strategy outflows were $15 billion in the
third quarter of 2023, driven by fixed income, multi-asset
and alternative investments and equity investments. Short-
term strategy inflows were $7 billion in the third quarter of
2023. Market and regulatory trends have resulted in
increased demand for lower fee asset management
products and for performance-based fees.

Total revenue of $827 million decreased 4% compared
with the third quarter of 2022 and increased 2% compared
with the second quarter of 2023. The drivers of total
revenue by line of business are indicated below.

Investment Management revenue of $557 million
decreased 4% compared with the third quarter of 2022 and
increased 2% compared with the second quarter of 2023.
The decrease compared with the

BNY Mellon 19

primarily reflects the third quarter 2022 goodwill
impairment in the Investment Management reporting unit
and the impact of the Alcentra divestiture, partially offset
by higher investments and the unfavorable impact of a
weaker U.S. dollar.

Year-to-date 2023 compared with year-to-date 2022

Total revenue of $2.5 billion decreased 9% compared with
the first nine months of 2022. Investment Management
revenue of $1.7 billion decreased 10%, primarily reflecting
the impact of the Alcentra divestiture, the mix of
cumulative AUM flows and lower market values, partially
offset by the abatement of money market fee waivers and
improved seed capital results. Wealth Management revenue
of $807 million decreased 9%, primarily reflecting lower
net interest revenue and changes in product mix.

Noninterest expense of $2.1 billion decreased 26%
compared with the first nine months of 2022, primarily
reflecting the third quarter 2022 goodwill impairment in
the Investment Management reporting unit, the impact of
the Alcentra divestiture and the favorable impact of
efficiency savings, partially offset by higher revenue-
related expenses and higher investments, as well as the
impact of inflation.

Review of financial results

Total revenue includes corporate treasury and other
investment activity, including hedging activity, which has
an offsetting impact between fee and other revenue and net
interest expense.

Total revenue increased $34 million compared with the
third quarter of 2022 and $55 million compared with the
second quarter of 2023. The increase compared with the
third quarter of 2022 primarily reflects debt
extinguishment gains, partially offset by net securities
losses.

The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $13 million
in the third quarter of 2023, primarily

20 BNY Mellon

reflecting a reduction in reserves related to financial
institutions.

Goodwill and other intangibles

Noninterest expense decreased $5 million compared with
the third quarter of 2022 and $47 million compared with
the second quarter of 2023. The decrease compared with
the second quarter of 2023 primarily reflects lower
litigation reserves.

Year-to-date 2023 compared with year-to-date 2022

Loss before income taxes increased $65 million compared
with the first nine months of 2022. Total fee and other
revenue decreased $113 million, primarily reflecting lower
strategic equity investment gains and net securities losses,
partially offset by debt extinguishment gains.

Noninterest expense increased $11 million compared with
the first nine months of 2022, primarily reflecting higher
staff expense.

Critical accounting estimates

Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our
2022 Annual Report. Our critical accounting estimates are
those related to the allowance for credit losses, goodwill
and other intangibles and litigation and regulatory
contingencies, as referenced below.

Critical accounting estimates Reference

“Allowance for credit losses.”

Also see below.

Litigation and regulatory
contingencies

“Legal proceedings” in Note 18 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

BNY Mellon’s business segments include six reporting
units for which goodwill impairment testing is performed
on an annual basis. An interim test is performed when
events or circumstances occur that may indicate that it is
more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting
unit may be less than its carrying value.

In the third quarter of 2023, due to the results of the second
quarter 2023 interim goodwill impairment test and
macroeconomic conditions, we performed an interim
goodwill impairment test of the Investment Management
reporting unit, which had $6.0 billion of allocated
goodwill. The fair value of the Investment Management
reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by
approximately 2%. We determined the fair value of the
Investment Management reporting unit using an income
approach based on management’s projections as of Sept.
30, 2023. The discount rate applied to these cash flows was
10.5%.

As of Sept. 30, 2023, if the discount rate applied to the
estimated cash flows was increased or decreased by 25
basis points, the fair value of the Investment Management
reporting unit would decrease or increase by 4%,
respectively. Similarly, if the long-term growth rate was
increased or decreased by 10 basis points, the fair value of
the Investment Management reporting unit would increase
or decrease by approximately 1%, respectively.

Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is subject to
uncertainty as it is reliant on estimates of cash flows that
extend far into the future, and, by their nature, are difficult
to estimate over such an extended time frame. In the future,
changes in the assumptions or the discount rate could
produce a material non-cash goodwill impairment.

Consolidated balance sheet review

One of our key risk management objectives is to maintain a
balance sheet that remains strong throughout market cycles
to meet the expectations of our major stakeholders,
including our shareholders, clients, creditors and
regulators.

We also seek to undertake overall liquidity risk, including
intraday liquidity risk, that stays within our risk appetite.
The objective of our balance sheet management strategy is
to maintain a balance sheet that is characterized by strong
liquidity and asset quality, ready access to external funding
sources at competitive rates and a strong capital structure
that supports our risk-taking activities and is adequate to
absorb potential losses. In managing the balance sheet,
appropriate consideration is given to balancing the
competing needs of maintaining sufficient levels of
liquidity and complying with applicable regulations and
supervisory expectations while optimizing profitability.

At Sept. 30, 2023, total assets were $405 billion, compared
with $406 billion at Dec. 31, 2022. The decrease in total
assets was primarily driven by lower securities and
interest-bearing deposits with banks, partially offset by
higher interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve
and other central banks. Deposits totaled $277 billion at
Sept. 30, 2023, compared with $279 billion at Dec. 31,
2022. The decrease reflects lower noninterest-bearing
(principally in U.S. offices) and interest-bearing deposits in
non-U.S. offices, partially offset by higher interest-bearing
deposits in U.S. offices. Total interest-bearing deposits as a
percentage of total interest-earning assets were 63% at
Sept. 30, 2023 and 58% at Dec. 31, 2022.

At Sept. 30, 2023, available funds totaled $152 billion and
included cash and due from banks,

22 BNY Mellon

interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and
other central banks, interest-bearing deposits with
banks and federal funds sold and securities purchased
under resale agreements. This compares with available
funds of $138 billion at Dec. 31, 2022. Total available
funds as a percentage of total assets was 37% at Sept. 30,
2023 and 34% at Dec. 31, 2022. For additional information
on our available funds, see “Liquidity and dividends.”

Securities were $128 billion, or 32% of total assets, at
Sept. 30, 2023, compared with $143 billion, or 35% of
total assets, at Dec. 31, 2022. The decrease primarily
reflects lower U.S. Treasury securities and agency
residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”), partially
offset by higher U.S. government agencies and
collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”). For additional
information on our securities portfolio, see “Securities”
and Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Loans were $66.3 billion, or 16% of total assets, at Sept.
30, 2023, compared with $66.1 billion, or 16% of total
assets, at Dec. 31, 2022. The increase was driven by higher
loans to financial institutions and other residential
mortgages, partially offset by lower overdrafts. For
additional information on our loan portfolio, see “Loans”
and Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Long-term debt totaled $29 billion at Sept. 30, 2023 and
$30 billion at Dec. 31, 2022. Maturities and repurchases,
and a decrease in the fair value of hedged long-term debt
were partially offset by issuances. For additional
information on long-term debt, see “Liquidity and
dividends.”

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation total
shareholders’ equity totaled $41 billion at Sept. 30, 2023
and Dec. 31, 2022. For additional information, see
“Capital.”

Country risk exposure

The following table presents BNY Mellon’s top 10
exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of Sept. 30,
2023, as well as certain countries with higher risk profiles.
The exposure is presented on an internal risk management
basis and has not been reduced by the allowance for credit
losses. We monitor our exposure to these and other
countries as part of our internal country risk management
process.

Country risk exposure at Sept. 30, 2023

Interest-bearing deposits

The country risk exposure below reflects the Company’s
risk to an immediate default of the counterparty or obligor
based on the country of residence of the entity which
incurs the liability. If there is credit risk mitigation, the
country of residence of the entity providing the risk
mitigation is the country of risk. The country of risk for
securities is generally based on the domicile of the issuer
of the security.

(d)    The top 10 country exposures comprise approximately 70% of our total non-U.S. exposure.
(e)    Represents cash balances with exposure to Russia.

Events in recent years have resulted in increased focus on
Brazil. The country risk exposure to Brazil is primarily
short-term trade finance loans extended to large financial
institutions. We also have operations in Brazil providing
investment services and investment management services.

The war in Ukraine has increased our focus on Russia. The
country risk exposure to Russia consists of cash balances
related to our securities services businesses and may
increase in the future to the extent cash is received for the
benefit of our clients that is subject to distribution
restrictions. BNY Mellon has ceased new banking business
in Russia

and suspended investment management purchases of
Russian securities. At Sept. 30, 2023, less than 0.1% of our
AUC/A and less than 0.01% of our AUM consisted of
Russian securities. We will continue to work with
multinational clients that depend on our custody and
recordkeeping services to manage their exposures.

We are monitoring our exposure to Israel as part of our
internal country risk management process. At Sept. 30,
2023, our total exposure to Israel was $187 million and
primarily consisted of investment grade short-term interest-
bearing deposits and OTC derivatives maturing within six
months.

Securities

In the discussion of our securities portfolio, we have included certain credit ratings information because the information can
indicate the degree of credit risk to which we are exposed. Significant changes in ratings classifications could indicate increased
credit risk for us and could be accompanied by an increase in the allowance for credit losses and/or a reduction in the fair value
of our securities portfolio.

(e)    Primarily consists of exposure to Canada, UK, Australia, Germany and Norway.

(f)    Primarily consists of exposure to Canada, Norway, the Netherlands, Sweden and Finland.
(g)    Includes net unrealized gains on derivatives hedging securities available-for-sale (including terminated hedges) of $2,406 million at June 30, 2023 and $2,820 million at Sept. 30,

2023.

(h)    At Sept. 30, 2023, includes pre-tax net unrealized losses of $3,036 million related to available-for-sale securities, net of hedges, and $6,796 million related to held-to-maturity

securities. The after-tax unrealized losses, net of hedges, related to available-for-sale securities is $2,293 million and the after-tax equivalent related to held-to-maturity securities is

$5,182 million.

The fair value of our securities portfolio, including related
hedges, was $124.2 billion at Sept. 30, 2023, compared
with $139.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2022. The decrease
primarily reflects lower U.S. Treasury securities and
agency RMBS, partially offset by higher U.S. government
agencies and CLOs.

At Sept. 30, 2023, the securities portfolio had a net
unrealized loss, including the impact of related hedges, of
$9.8 billion, compared with $9.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2022.
The increase in the unrealized loss, including the impact of
related hedges, primarily reflects the impact of higher
interest rates, partially offset by securities moving closer to
maturity.

The fair value of the available-for-sale securities totaled
$80.0 billion at Sept. 30, 2023, net of hedges, or 64% of
the securities portfolio, net of hedges. The fair value of the
held-to-maturity securities totaled $44.2 billion at Sept. 30,
2023, or 36% of the securities portfolio, net of hedges.

The unrealized loss (after-tax) on our available-for-sale
securities portfolio, net of hedges, included in accumulated
other comprehensive income was $2.3 billion at Sept. 30,
2023, compared with $2.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2022. Net
unrealized loss, including the impact of hedges, decreased
as securities moved closer to maturity, partially offset by
the impact of higher interest rates.

At Sept. 30, 2023, our total lending-related exposure of
$116.9 billion decreased 1% compared with Dec. 31, 2022,
primarily reflecting lower overdrafts and exposure in the
wealth management loan portfolio, partially offset by
higher exposure in the financial institutions and other
residential mortgage portfolios.

Our financial institutions and commercial portfolios
comprise our largest concentrated risk. These portfolios
comprised 47% of our total exposure at Sept. 30, 2023 and
Dec. 31, 2022. Additionally, most of our overdrafts relate
to financial institutions.

The financial institutions portfolio exposure was $42.2
billion at Sept. 30, 2023, an increase of 2% compared with
Dec. 31, 2022, primarily reflecting higher exposure in the
banks portfolio.

Financial institution exposures are high quality, with 94%
of the exposures meeting the investment grade equivalent
criteria of our internal credit rating classification at Sept.
30, 2023. Each customer is assigned an internal credit
rating, which is mapped to an equivalent external rating
agency grade based upon a number of dimensions, which
are continually evaluated and may change over time. For
ratings of non-U.S. counterparties, our internal credit rating
is generally capped at a rating equivalent to the sovereign
rating of the country where the counterparty resides,
regardless of the internal credit rating assigned to the
counterparty or the underlying collateral.

The exposure to financial institutions is generally short
term, with 84% of the exposures expiring within one year.
At Sept. 30, 2023, 55% of the exposure to financial
institutions had an expiration within 90 days, compared
with 17% at Dec. 31, 2022.

In addition, 64% of the financial institutions exposure is
secured. For example, securities industry clients

and asset managers often borrow against marketable
securities held in custody.

At Sept. 30, 2023, the secured intraday credit provided to
dealers in connection with their tri-party repo activity
totaled $16.1 billion and was included in the securities
industry portfolio. Dealers secure the outstanding intraday
credit with high-quality liquid collateral having a market
value in excess of the amount of the outstanding credit.
Secured intraday credit facilities represent approximately
38% of the exposure in the financial institutions portfolio
and are reviewed and reapproved annually.

The asset managers portfolio exposure is high quality, with
97% of the exposures meeting our investment grade
equivalent ratings criteria as of Sept. 30, 2023. These
exposures are generally short-term liquidity facilities, with
the majority to regulated mutual funds.

Our banks portfolio exposure primarily relates to global
trade finance. These exposures are short term in nature,
with 97% due in less than one year. The investment grade
percentage of our banks portfolio exposure was 85% at
Sept. 30, 2023, compared with 86% at Dec. 31, 2022. Our
non-investment grade exposures are primarily trade finance
loans in Brazil.

The commercial portfolio exposure was $13.3 billion at
Sept. 30, 2023, a decrease of 1% from Dec. 31, 2022,
primarily reflecting lower exposure in the manufacturing
and media and telecom portfolios, partially offset by higher
exposure in the services and other portfolio.

Our credit strategy is to focus on investment grade clients
that are active users of our non-credit services. The
following table summarizes the percentage of the financial

Wealth management loans

Our wealth management loan exposure was $10.0 billion at
Sept. 30, 2023, compared with $10.9 billion

at Dec. 31, 2022. Wealth management loans primarily
consist of loans to high-net-worth individuals, a majority
of which are secured by the customers’ investment
management accounts or custody accounts.

Wealth management mortgages

Our wealth management mortgage exposure was $9.4
billion at Sept. 30, 2023, compared with $9.2 billion at
Dec. 31, 2022. Wealth management mortgages primarily
consist of loans to high-net-worth individuals, which are
secured by residential property. Wealth management
mortgages are primarily interest-only, adjustable-rate
mortgages with a weighted-average loan-to-value ratio of
61% at origination. At Sept. 30, 2023, less than 1% of the
mortgages were past due.

At Sept. 30, 2023, the wealth management mortgage
portfolio consisted of the following geographic
concentrations: California – 21%; New York – 14%;
Florida – 11%; Massachusetts – 8%; and other – 46%.

Our commercial real estate exposure totaled $10.1 billion
at Sept. 30, 2023 and Dec. 31, 2022. Our income-
producing commercial real estate facilities are focused on
experienced owners and are structured with moderate
leverage based on existing cash flows. Our commercial
real estate lending activities also include construction and
renovation facilities. Our client base consists of
experienced developers and long-term holders of real
estate assets. Loans are approved on the basis of existing or
projected cash flows and supported by appraisals and
knowledge of local market conditions. Development loans
are structured with moderate leverage and, in many
instances, involve some level of recourse to the developer.

At Sept. 30, 2023, the unsecured portfolio consisted of real
estate investment trusts (“REITs”) and real estate operating
companies, which are both primarily investment grade.

At Sept. 30, 2023, our commercial real estate portfolio
consisted of the following concentrations: New York metro
– 36%; REITs and real estate operating companies – 28%;
and other – 36%.

Lease financings

The lease financings portfolio exposure totaled $633
million at Sept. 30, 2023 and $657 million at Dec. 31,
2022. At Sept. 30, 2023, 100% of leasing exposure was
investment grade, or investment grade equivalent, and
consisted of exposures backed by well-diversified assets,
primarily real estate and

large-ticket transportation equipment. The largest
components of our lease residual value exposure relate to
freight-related rail cars and aircraft. Assets are both
domestic and foreign-based, with primary concentrations
in Germany and the U.S.

Other residential mortgages

The other residential mortgages portfolio primarily consists
of 1-4 family residential mortgage loans and totaled $1.0
billion at Sept. 30, 2023 and $345 million at Dec. 31, 2022.
Included in this portfolio at Sept. 30, 2023 was $750
million of fixed-rate jumbo mortgage loans, purchased
primarily in the first quarter of 2023, with a weighted-
average loan-to-value ratio of 73% at origination.

Overdrafts

Overdrafts primarily relate to custody and securities
clearance clients and are generally repaid within two
business days.

Capital call financing

Capital call financing includes loans to private equity funds
that are secured by the fund investors’ capital commitments
and the funds’ rights to call capital.

Other loans

Other loans primarily include loans to consumers that are
fully collateralized with equities, mutual funds and fixed-
income securities.

28 BNY Mellon

Margin loans

Margin loan exposure of $17.2 billion at Sept. 30, 2023
and $16.9 billion at Dec. 31, 2022 was collateralized with
marketable securities. Borrowers

Allowance for credit losses

are required to maintain a daily collateral margin in excess
of 100% of the value of the loan. Margin loans included $6
billion at Sept. 30, 2023 and Dec. 31, 2022 related to a
term loan program that offers fully collateralized loans to
broker-dealers.

Our credit strategy is to focus on investment grade clients who are active users of our non-credit services. Our primary exposure
to the credit risk of a customer consists of funded loans, unfunded contractual commitments to lend, standby letters of credit
and overdrafts associated with our custody and securities clearance businesses.

The provision for credit losses was $3 million in the third
quarter of 2023, compared with a benefit of $30 million in
the third quarter of 2022.

The allowance for loan losses and the allowance for
lending-related commitments represent

management’s estimate of lifetime expected losses in our
credit portfolio. This evaluation process is subject to
numerous estimates and judgments. To the extent actual
results differ from forecasts or management’s judgment,
the allowance for credit losses may be greater or less than
future charge-offs.

(a)    The allowance allocated to margin loans, overdrafts and other loans was insignificant at Sept. 30, 2023, June 30, 2023, Dec. 31, 2022 and Sept. 30,

2022.

The allocation of the allowance for credit losses is
inherently judgmental, and the entire allowance for credit
losses is available to absorb credit losses regardless of the
nature of the losses.

Our allowance for credit losses is sensitive to a number of
inputs, most notably the credit ratings assigned to each
borrower, as well as macroeconomic forecast assumptions
that are incorporated into our estimate of credit losses
through the expected life of the loan portfolio. Thus, as the
macroeconomic environment and related forecasts change,
the allowance for credit losses may change materially. The
following sensitivity analyses do not represent
management’s expectations of the deterioration of our
portfolios or the economic environment, but are provided
as hypothetical scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the
allowance for credit losses to changes in key inputs. If
commercial real estate property values were increased 10%
and all other credits were rated one grade better, the
quantitative allowance would have decreased by
$47 million, and if commercial real estate property values
were decreased 10% and all other credits were rated one
grade worse, the quantitative allowance would have
increased by $83 million. Our multi-scenario-based
macroeconomic forecast used in determining the Sept. 30,
2023 allowance for credit losses consisted of three
scenarios. The baseline scenario reflects slightly negative
GDP growth through the fourth quarter of 2023 before
moderating, slightly rising unemployment and declining
commercial real estate prices through the end of 2024. The
upside scenario reflects faster GDP growth, slightly
declining unemployment and higher commercial real estate
prices compared with the baseline. The downside

30 BNY Mellon

scenario contemplates negative GDP growth through the
second quarter of 2024 with subsequent stabilization, as
well as rapidly increasing unemployment through 2024 and
sharply lower commercial real estate prices than the
baseline. In the third quarter of 2023, we placed the most
weight on our downside scenario, followed by the baseline
scenario, with the remaining weighting placed on the
upside scenario. From a sensitivity perspective, at Sept. 30,
2023, if we had applied 100% weighting to the downside
scenario, the allowance for credit losses would have been
approximately $83 million higher.

Nonperforming assets were $48 million at Sept. 30, 2023, a
decrease of $61 million, compared with $109 million at
Dec. 31, 2022. The decrease reflects lower nonperforming
commercial real estate loans.

Deposits

Total deposits were $277.5 billion at Sept. 30, 2023, a
decrease of 1%, compared with $279.0 billion at Dec. 31,
2022. The decrease reflects lower noninterest-bearing
(principally in U.S. offices) and interest-bearing deposits in
non-U.S. offices, partially offset by higher interest-bearing
deposits in U.S. offices.

Noninterest-bearing deposits were $60.6 billion at Sept. 30,
2023, compared with $78.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2022.
Interest-bearing deposits were primarily demand deposits
and totaled $216.9 billion at Sept. 30, 2023, compared with
$201.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2022.

Short-term borrowings

We fund ourselves primarily through deposits and, to a
lesser extent, other short-term borrowings and long-term
debt. Short-term borrowings consist of federal funds
purchased and securities sold under repurchase
agreements, payables to customers and broker-dealers,
commercial paper and other borrowed funds. Certain short-
term borrowings, for example, securities sold under
repurchase agreements, require the delivery of securities as
collateral.

Federal funds purchased and securities sold under
repurchase agreements include repurchase agreement
activity with the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation
(“FICC”), where we record interest expense on a gross
basis, but the ending and average balances reflect the
impact of offsetting under enforceable netting agreements.
This activity primarily relates to government securities
collateralized resale and repurchase agreements executed
with clients that are novated to and settle with the FICC.

Payables to customers and broker-dealers represent funds
awaiting reinvestment and short sale proceeds payable on
demand. Payables to customers and broker-dealers are
driven by customer trading activity and market volatility.

The Bank of New York Mellon may issue commercial
paper that matures within 397 days from

the date of issue and is not redeemable prior to maturity or
subject to voluntary prepayment.

Other borrowed funds primarily include borrowings from
the Federal Home Loan Bank, overdrafts of sub-custodian
account balances in our Securities Services businesses,
finance lease liabilities and borrowings under lines of
credit by our Pershing subsidiaries. Overdrafts typically
relate to timing differences for settlements.

Liquidity and dividends

BNY Mellon defines liquidity as the ability of the Parent
and its subsidiaries to access funding or convert assets to
cash quickly and efficiently, or to roll over or issue new
debt, especially during periods of market stress, at a
reasonable cost, and in order to meet its short-term (up to
one year) obligations. Funding liquidity risk is the risk that
BNY Mellon cannot meet its cash and collateral
obligations at a reasonable cost for both expected and
unexpected cash flow and collateral needs without
adversely affecting daily operations or our financial
condition. Funding liquidity risk can arise from funding
mismatches, market constraints from the inability to
convert assets into cash, the inability to hold or raise cash,
low overnight deposits, deposit run-off or contingent
liquidity events.

Changes in economic conditions or exposure to credit,
market, operational, legal and reputational risks also can
affect BNY Mellon’s liquidity risk profile and are
considered in our liquidity risk framework. For additional
information, see “Risk Management – Liquidity Risk” in
our 2022 Annual Report.

The Parent’s policy is to have access to sufficient
unencumbered cash and cash equivalents at each quarter-
end to cover maturities and other forecasted debt
redemptions, net interest payments and net tax payments
for the following 18-month period, and to provide
sufficient collateral to satisfy transactions subject to
Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. As of Sept. 30,
2023, the Parent was in compliance with this policy.

We monitor and control liquidity exposures and funding
needs within and across significant legal entities, branches,
currencies and business lines, taking into account, among
other factors, any applicable restrictions on the transfer of
liquidity among entities.

BNY Mellon 31

BNY Mellon also manages potential intraday liquidity
risks. We monitor and manage intraday liquidity against
existing and expected intraday liquid resources (such as
cash balances, remaining intraday credit capacity, intraday
contingency funding and available collateral) to enable
BNY Mellon to meet its intraday obligations under normal
and reasonably severe stressed conditions.

We define available funds for internal liquidity
management purposes as cash and due from banks,
interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and
other central banks, interest-bearing deposits with banks
and federal funds sold and securities purchased under
resale agreements.

Total available funds were $151.6 billion at Sept. 30, 2023,
compared with $138.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2022. The
increase was primarily due to higher interest-bearing
deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central banks,
partially offset by lower interest-bearing deposits with
banks.

Average non-core sources of funds, such as federal funds
purchased and securities sold under repurchase
agreements, trading liabilities, other borrowed funds and
commercial paper, were $27.0 billion for the first nine
months of 2023, compared with $16.4 billion for the first
nine months of 2022. The increase primarily reflects
federal funds purchased and securities sold under
repurchase agreements and other borrowed funds.

Average interest-bearing foreign deposits, primarily from
our European-based businesses included in the Securities
Services and Market and Wealth Services segments, were
$88.9 billion for the first nine months of 2023, compared
with $103.0 billion for the first nine months of 2022.
Average interest-bearing domestic deposits were $120.8
billion for the first nine months of 2023, compared with
$112.3 billion for the first nine months of 2022. The
changes primarily reflect client activity.

32 BNY Mellon

Average payables to customers and broker-dealers were
$15.1 billion for the first nine months of 2023 and $17.1
billion for the first nine months of 2022. Payables to
customers and broker-dealers are driven by customer
trading activity and market volatility.

Average long-term debt was $31.1 billion for the first nine
months of 2023 and $26.8 billion for the first nine months
of 2022.

Average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased to $61.4
billion for the first nine months of 2023 from $89.0 billion
for the first nine months of 2022, primarily reflecting client
activity.

A significant reduction of client activity in our Securities
Services and Market and Wealth Services business
segments would reduce our access to deposits. See
“Asset/liability management” for additional factors that
could impact our deposit balances.

Sources of liquidity

The Parent’s major sources of liquidity are access to the
debt and equity markets, dividends from its subsidiaries,
and cash on hand and cash otherwise made available in
business-as-usual circumstances to the Parent through a
committed credit facility with our intermediate holding
company (“IHC”).

Our ability to access the capital markets on favorable terms, or at all, is partially dependent on our credit ratings, which are as
follows:

During the third quarter of 2023, Moody’s Investor Service
(“Moody’s”) placed the long-term issuer ratings, debt
ratings, counterparty risk ratings and counterparty risk
assessments of the Parent and our rated subsidiaries on
review for downgrade. Moody’s also affirmed all Prime-1
short-term ratings of the Parent and rated subsidiaries as
well as the long-term deposit ratings for The Bank of New
York Mellon and BNY Mellon, N.A.

Long-term debt totaled $29.2 billion at Sept. 30, 2023 and
$30.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2022. Maturities and repurchases
totaling $5.5 billion and a decrease in the fair value of
hedged long-term debt were partially offset by issuances of
$4.5 billion. Long-term debt of $600 million will mature in
the remainder of 2023.

In October, the Parent issued $900 million of fixed to
floating rate senior notes maturing in 2029. The annual
fixed interest rate is 6.317% from issuance to, but
excluding, Oct. 25, 2028, and then an annual interest rate
of the compounded secured overnight financing rate
(“SOFR”) plus 159.8 basis points. The Parent also issued
$1.1 billion of fixed to floating rate senior notes maturing
in 2034. The annual fixed interest rate is 6.474% from
issuance to, but excluding, Oct. 25, 2033, and then an
annual interest

rate of the compounded SOFR plus 184.5 basis points.

The Bank of New York Mellon may issue notes and
certificates of deposit (“CDs”). At Sept. 30, 2023 and Dec.
31, 2022, $1.3 billion and $780 million, respectively, of
notes were outstanding. At Sept. 30, 2023 and Dec. 31,
2022, $387 million and $122 million, respectively, of CDs
were outstanding.

The Bank of New York Mellon also issues commercial
paper that matures within 397 days from the date of issue
and is not redeemable prior to maturity or subject to
voluntary prepayment. There was no commercial paper
outstanding at Sept. 30, 2023 and Dec. 31, 2022. The
average commercial paper outstanding was $4 million for
the first nine months of 2023 and $5 million for the first
nine months of 2022.

Subsequent to Sept. 30, 2023, our U.S. bank subsidiaries
could declare dividends to the Parent of approximately
$2.2 billion, without the need for a regulatory waiver. In
addition, at Sept. 30, 2023, nonbank subsidiaries of the
Parent had liquid assets of approximately $4.4 billion.
Restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our
subsidiaries are discussed in more detail in “Supervision
and

  
 
Regulation – Capital Planning and Stress Testing –
Payment of Dividends, Stock Repurchases and Other
Capital Distributions” and in Note 19 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, both in our 2022
Annual Report.

Pershing LLC has one uncommitted line of credit in place
for funding purposes that is guaranteed by the Parent for
$300 million. Average borrowings under this line were less
than $1 million in the third quarter of 2023. Pershing
Limited, an indirect UK-based subsidiary of BNY Mellon,
has two separate uncommitted lines of credit amounting to
$256 million in aggregate. Average borrowings under these
lines were $15 million in the third quarter of 2023.

The double leverage ratio is the ratio of our equity
investment in subsidiaries divided by our consolidated
Parent company equity, which includes our noncumulative
perpetual preferred stock. In short, the double leverage
ratio measures the extent to which equity in subsidiaries is
financed by Parent company debt. As the double leverage
ratio increases, this can reflect greater demands on a
company’s cash flows in order to service interest payments
and debt maturities. BNY Mellon’s double leverage ratio is
managed in a range considering the high level of
unencumbered available liquid assets held in its principal
subsidiaries (such as central bank deposit placements and
government securities), the Company’s cash generating
fee-based business model, with fee revenue representing
74% of total revenue in the third quarter of 2023, and the
dividend capacity of our banking subsidiaries. Our double
leverage ratio was 118.7% at Sept. 30, 2023 and 120.5% at
Dec. 31, 2022, and within the range targeted by
management.

Uses of funds

The Parent’s major uses of funds are repurchases of
common stock, payment of dividends, principal and
interest payments on its borrowings, acquisitions and
additional investments in its subsidiaries.

In August 2023, a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per common
share was paid to common shareholders. Our common
stock dividend payout ratio was 35% for the third quarter
of 2023.

BNY Mellon 33

In the third quarter of 2023, we repurchased 10.0 million
common shares at an average price of $45.03 per common
share, for a total cost of $450 million.

Liquidity coverage ratio (“LCR”)

U.S. regulators have established an LCR that requires
certain banking organizations, including BNY Mellon, to
maintain a minimum amount of unencumbered high-
quality liquid assets (“HQLA”) sufficient to withstand the
net cash outflow under a hypothetical standardized acute
liquidity stress scenario for a 30-day time horizon.

The following table presents BNY Mellon’s consolidated
HQLA, and the average HQLA and average LCR.

BNY Mellon and each of our affected domestic bank
subsidiaries were compliant with the U.S. LCR
requirements of at least 100% throughout the third quarter
of 2023.

Net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”)

The NSFR is a liquidity requirement applicable to large
U.S. banking organizations, including BNY Mellon. The
NSFR is expressed as a ratio of the available stable funding
to the required stable funding amount over a one-year
horizon. Our average consolidated NSFR was 136% for the
third quarter of 2023 and 136% for the second quarter of
2023.

BNY Mellon and each of our affected domestic bank
subsidiaries were compliant with the NSFR requirement of
at least 100% throughout the third quarter of 2023.

Statement of cash flows

The following summarizes the activity reflected on the
consolidated statement of cash flows. While this
information may be helpful to highlight certain macro
trends and business strategies, the cash flow analysis may
not be as relevant when analyzing changes in our net
earnings and net assets. We believe that in addition to the
traditional cash flow analysis, the discussion related to
liquidity and dividends and asset/liability management
herein may provide more useful context in evaluating our
liquidity position and related activity.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $8.0 billion
in the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2023, compared with
$12.1 billion in the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2022. In
the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2023, cash flows provided
by operations primarily resulted from earnings and changes
in accruals and other, net. In the nine months ended Sept.
30, 2022, cash flows provided by operations primarily
resulted from changes in trading assets and liabilities and
earnings.

Net cash used for investing activities was $4.5 billion in
the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2023, compared with $5.3
billion in the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2022. In the nine
months ended Sept. 30, 2023, net

Capital

cash used for investing activities primarily resulted from
changes in interest-bearing deposits with the Federal
Reserve and other central banks and changes in federal
funds sold and securities purchased under resale
agreements, partially offset by changes in
investment securities. In the nine months ended Sept. 30,
2022, net cash used for investing activities primarily
resulted from changes in interest-bearing deposits with the
Federal Reserve and other central banks, partially offset by
changes in federal funds sold and securities purchased
under resale agreements.

Net cash used for financing activities was $7.3 billion in
the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2023, compared with $7.5
billion in the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2022. In the nine
months ended Sept. 30, 2023, net cash used for financing
activities primarily resulted from changes in payables to
customers and broker-dealers and repayments, redemptions
and repurchases of long-term debt, partially offset by the
net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt. In the
nine months ended Sept. 30, 2022, net cash used for
financing activities primarily resulted from changes in
deposits, repayments of long-term debt and changes in
payables to customers and broker-dealers, partially offset

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation total
shareholders’ equity increased to $41.0 billion at Sept. 30,
2023 from $40.7 billion at Dec. 31, 2022. The increase
primarily reflects earnings, partially offset by common
stock repurchase activity and dividends.

The unrealized loss (after-tax) on our available-for-sale
securities portfolio, net of hedges, included in accumulated
other comprehensive income was $2.3 billion at Sept. 30,
2023, compared with $2.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2022. Net
unrealized loss, including the impact of hedges, decreased
as securities moved closer to maturity, partially offset by
the impact of higher interest rates.

In the first nine months of 2023, we repurchased 45.8
million common shares at an average price of $47.06 per
common share for a total of $2.2 billion.

In January 2023, we announced a share repurchase
program approved by our Board of Directors providing for
the repurchase of up to $5.0 billion of common shares
beginning Jan. 1, 2023. This new share repurchase plan
replaced all previously authorized share repurchase plans.

In July 2023, our Board of Directors approved a 14%
increase in the quarterly cash dividend on common stock,
from $0.34 to $0.42 per share. The increased quarterly cash
dividend was paid on Aug. 10, 2023.

Capital adequacy

Regulators establish certain levels of capital for bank
holding companies (“BHCs”) and banks, including BNY
Mellon and our bank subsidiaries, in accordance with
established quantitative measurements. For the Parent to
maintain its status as a financial holding company, our U.S.
bank subsidiaries and BNY Mellon must, among other
things, qualify as “well capitalized.” As of Sept. 30, 2023
and Dec. 31, 2022, BNY Mellon and our U.S. bank
subsidiaries were “well capitalized.” Failure to satisfy
regulatory standards, including “well capitalized” status or
capital adequacy rules more generally, could result in
limitations on our activities and adversely affect our
financial condition. See the discussion of these matters in
“Supervision and Regulation – Regulated Entities of BNY
Mellon and Ancillary Regulatory Requirements” and “Risk
Factors – Capital and Liquidity Risk – Failure to satisfy
regulatory standards, including “well capitalized” and
“well managed” status or capital adequacy and liquidity
rules more generally, could result in limitations on our
activities and adversely affect our business and financial
condition,” both of which are in our 2022 Annual Report.

The U.S. banking agencies’ capital rules are based on the
framework adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision, as amended from time to time. For additional
information on these capital requirements, see
“Supervision and Regulation” in our 2022 Annual Report.

(a)    Minimum requirements for Sept. 30, 2023 include minimum thresholds plus currently applicable buffers. The U.S. global systemically important banks
(“G-SIB”) surcharge is 1.5%. The countercyclical capital buffer is currently set to 0%. The stress capital buffer (“SCB”) requirement is 2.5%, equal to
the regulatory minimum for Standardized Approach capital ratios.

(b)    For our CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios, our effective capital ratios under U.S. capital rules are the lower of the ratios as calculated

under the Standardized and Advanced Approaches. The Tier 1 leverage ratio is based on Tier 1 capital and quarterly average total assets.

(c)    The Federal Reserve’s regulations do not establish well capitalized thresholds for these measures for BHCs.
(d)    The SLR is based on Tier 1 capital and total leverage exposure, which includes certain off-balance sheet exposures.
N/A – Not applicable.

Our CET1 ratio under the Advanced Approaches was
11.4% at Sept. 30, 2023 and 11.2% at Dec. 31, 2022. The
increase was primarily driven by capital generated through
earnings and lower RWAs, partially offset by capital
deployed through common stock repurchases and
dividends.

The Tier 1 leverage ratio was 6.1% at Sept. 30, 2023 and
5.8% at Dec. 31, 2022. The increase primarily reflects
lower average assets.

Risk-based capital ratios vary depending on the size of the
balance sheet at period end and the levels and types of
investments in assets, and leverage ratios vary based on the
average size of the balance sheet over the quarter. The
balance sheet size fluctuates from period to period based
on levels of customer and market activity. In general, when
servicing clients are more actively trading securities,
deposit balances and the balance sheet as a whole are
higher. In addition, when markets experience significant

volatility or stress, our balance sheet size may increase
considerably as client deposit levels increase.

Our capital ratios are necessarily subject to, among other
things, anticipated compliance with all necessary
enhancements to model calibration, approval by regulators
of certain models used as part of RWA calculations, other
refinements, further implementation guidance from
regulators, market practices and standards and any changes
BNY Mellon may make to its businesses. As a
consequence of these factors, our capital ratios may
materially change, and may be volatile over time and from
period to period.

Under the Advanced Approaches, our operational loss risk
model is informed by external losses, including fines and
penalties levied against institutions in the financial services
industry, particularly those that relate to businesses in
which we operate, and as a result, external losses have
impacted and could in the

BNY Mellon 37

future impact the amount of capital that we are required to
hold.

Stress capital buffer

In July 2023, the Federal Reserve announced that BNY
Mellon’s SCB requirement would remain at 2.5%, equal to
the regulatory floor, for the period from Oct. 1, 2023
through Sept. 30, 2024. The SCB replaced the static 2.5%
capital conservation buffer for Standardized Approach
capital ratios for CCAR BHCs. The SCB does not apply to
bank subsidiaries, which remain subject to the static 2.5%
capital conservation buffer. See “Supervision and
Regulation” in our 2022 Annual Report for additional
information.

The SCB final rule generally eliminates the requirement
for prior approval of common stock repurchases in excess
of the distributions in a firm’s capital plan, provided that
such distributions are consistent with applicable capital
requirements and buffers, including the SCB.

other conditions. Eligible LTD consists of the unpaid
principal balance of eligible unsecured debt securities,
subject to haircuts for amounts due to be paid within two
years, that satisfy certain other conditions. Debt issued

Trading activities and risk management

Our trading activities are focused on acting as a market-
maker for our customers, facilitating customer trades and
risk-mitigating hedging in compliance with the Volcker
Rule. The risk from market-making activities for customers
is managed by our traders and limited in total exposure
through a system of position limits, value-at-risk (“VaR”)
methodology and other market sensitivity measures. VaR is
the potential loss in value due to adverse market
movements over a defined time horizon with a specified
confidence level. The calculation of our VaR used by
management and presented below assumes a one-day
holding period, utilizes a 99% confidence level and
incorporates non-linear product characteristics. VaR
facilitates comparisons across portfolios of different risk
characteristics. VaR also captures the diversification of
aggregated risk at the firm-wide level.

BNY Mellon 39

VaR represents a key risk management measure, and it is
important to note the inherent limitations to VaR, which
include:

• VaR does not estimate potential losses over longer time

horizons where moves may be extreme;

• VaR does not take into account the potential variability

of market liquidity; and

• Previous moves in market risk factors may not produce

accurate predictions of all future market moves.

See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information on the VaR
methodology.

The following tables indicate the calculated VaR amounts
for the trading portfolio for the designated periods using
the historical simulation VaR model.

N/M – Because the minimum and maximum may occur on different days for
different risk components, it is not meaningful to compute a minimum
and maximum portfolio diversification effect.

The interest rate component of VaR represents instruments
whose values are predominantly driven by interest rate
levels. These instruments include, but are not limited to,
U.S. Treasury securities, swaps, swaptions, forward rate
agreements, exchange-traded futures and options, and other
interest rate derivative products.

The foreign exchange component of VaR represents
instruments whose values predominantly vary with the
level or volatility of currency exchange rates or interest
rates. These instruments include, but are not limited to,
currency balances, spot and forward transactions, currency
options and other currency derivative products.

The equity component of VaR consists of instruments that
represent an ownership interest in the form of domestic and
foreign common stock or other equity-linked instruments.
These instruments include, but are not limited to, common
stock, exchange-traded funds, preferred stock, listed equity
options (puts and calls), OTC equity options, equity total
return swaps, equity index futures and other equity
derivative products.

The credit component of VaR represents instruments whose
values are predominantly driven by credit spread levels,
i.e., idiosyncratic default risk. These instruments include,
but are not limited to, single issuer credit default swaps,
and securities with exposures from corporate and
municipal credit spreads.

The diversification component of VaR is the risk reduction
benefit that occurs when combining portfolios and
offsetting positions, and from the correlated behavior of
risk factor movements.

(a)    Trading revenue (loss) includes realized and unrealized gains and losses

primarily related to spot and forward foreign exchange transactions,
derivatives and securities trades for our customers and excludes any

associated commissions, underwriting fees and net interest revenue.

Trading assets include debt and equity instruments and
derivative assets, primarily foreign exchange and interest
rate contracts, not designated as hedging instruments.
Trading assets were $10.7 billion at Sept. 30, 2023 and
$9.9 billion at Dec. 31, 2022.

Trading liabilities include debt and equity instruments and
derivative liabilities, primarily foreign exchange and
interest rate contracts, not designated as hedging
instruments. Trading liabilities were $7.4 billion at Sept.
30, 2023 and $5.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2022.

Under our fair value methodology for derivative contracts,
an initial “risk-neutral” valuation is performed on each
position assuming time discounting based on a AA credit
curve. In addition, we consider credit risk in arriving at the
fair value of our derivatives.

We reflect external credit ratings as well as observable
credit default swap spreads for both ourselves and our
counterparties when measuring the fair value of our
derivative positions. Accordingly, the valuation of our
derivative positions is sensitive to

the current changes in our own credit spreads, as well as
those of our counterparties.

At Sept. 30, 2023, our OTC derivative assets, including
those in hedging relationships, of $2.7 billion included a
credit valuation adjustment (“CVA”) deduction of $12
million. Our OTC derivative liabilities, including those in
hedging relationships, of $3.2 billion included a debit
valuation adjustment (“DVA”) of $8 million related to our
own credit spread. Net of hedges, the CVA decreased by
less than $1 million and the DVA increased by less than $1
million in the third quarter of 2023, which increased
investment and other revenue – other trading revenue by
less than $1 million. The net impact decreased investment
and other revenue – other trading revenue by less than $1
million in the second quarter of 2023 and increased
investment and other revenue – other trading revenue by
$3 million in the third quarter of 2022.

The table below summarizes our exposure, net of collateral
related to our derivative counterparties, as determined on
an internal risk management basis. Significant changes in
counterparty credit ratings could alter the level of credit
risk faced by BNY Mellon.

Asset/liability management

Our diversified business activities include processing
securities, accepting deposits, investing in securities,
lending, raising money as needed to fund assets and other
transactions. The market risks from these activities include
interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. Our primary
market risk is exposure to movements in U.S. dollar
interest rates and certain foreign currency interest rates. We
actively manage interest rate sensitivity and use earnings
simulation and discounted cash flow models to identify
interest rate exposures.

BNY Mellon 41

An earnings simulation model is the primary tool used to
assess changes in pre-tax net interest revenue between a
baseline scenario and hypothetical interest rate scenarios.
Interest rate sensitivity is quantified by calculating the
change in pre-tax net interest revenue between the
scenarios over a 12-month measurement period.

The baseline scenario incorporates the market’s forward
rate expectations and management’s assumptions regarding
client deposit rates, credit spreads, changes in the
prepayment behavior of loans and securities and the impact
of derivative financial instruments used for interest rate
risk management purposes as of each respective quarter-
end. These assumptions have been developed through a
combination of historical analysis and future expected
pricing behavior and are inherently uncertain. Actual
results may differ materially from projected results due to
timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes,
and changes in market conditions and management’s
strategies, among other factors. Client deposit levels and
mix are key assumptions impacting net interest revenue in
the baseline as well as the hypothetical interest rate
scenarios. The earnings simulation model assumes static
deposit levels and mix, and it also assumes that no
management actions will be taken to mitigate the effects of
interest rate changes. Typically, the baseline scenario uses
the average deposit balances of the quarter.

In the table below, we use the earnings simulation model to
assess the impact of various hypothetical interest rate
scenarios compared to the baseline scenario. In each of the
scenarios, all currencies’ interest rates are instantaneously
shifted higher or lower at the start of the forecast. Long-
term interest rates are defined as all tenors equal to or
greater than three years and short-term interest rates are
defined as all tenors equal to or less than three months.
Interim term points are interpolated where applicable. The
impact of interest rate shifts may not be linear. The results
of this earnings simulation should therefore not be
extrapolated for more severe interest rate scenarios than
those presented in the table below.

The following table shows net interest revenue sensitivity
for BNY Mellon.

(a)    Prior periods have been updated to reflect the impact of a 100

basis point decrease in long-term rates while short-term rates were
unchanged.

At Sept. 30, 2023, the impact of a 100 bps upward shift in
rates on net interest revenue decreased compared with June
30, 2023. The primary driver is lower deposit balances in
the most recent quarter, which reduce the benefit of rising
interest rates.

While the net interest revenue sensitivity scenario
calculations assume static deposit balances to facilitate
consistent period-over-period comparisons, net interest
revenue is impacted by changes in deposit balances.
Noninterest-bearing deposits are particularly sensitive to
changes in short-term rates.

To illustrate the net interest revenue sensitivity to deposit
run-off, we estimate that a $5 billion instantaneous
reduction/increase in U.S. dollar-denominated noninterest-
bearing deposits would reduce/increase the net interest
revenue sensitivity results in the up 100 basis point
scenario in the table above by approximately $320 million.
The impact would be smaller if the run-off was assumed to
be a mixture of interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing
deposits.

Additionally, during periods of low short-term interest
rates, money market mutual fund fees and other similar
fees are typically waived to protect investors from negative
returns. See “Fee and other revenue” in our 2022 Annual
Report for additional details on money market fee waivers.

For a discussion of factors impacting the growth or
contraction of deposits, see “Risk Factors – Capital and
Liquidity Risk – Our business, financial condition and
results of operations could be adversely affected if we do
not effectively manage our liquidity” in our 2022 Annual
Report.

Supplemental information – Explanation of GAAP
and Non-GAAP financial measures

BNY Mellon has included in this Form 10-Q certain Non-
GAAP financial measures on a tangible basis as a
supplement to GAAP information, which exclude goodwill
and intangible assets, net of deferred tax liabilities. We
believe that the return on tangible common equity – Non-
GAAP is additional useful information for investors
because it presents a measure of those assets that can
generate income, and the tangible book value per common
share – Non-GAAP is additional useful information
because it presents the level of tangible assets in relation to
shares of common stock outstanding.

BNY Mellon has presented revenue measures excluding
notable items, including disposal gains. Expense measures,
excluding notable items, including goodwill impairment,
severance expense and litigation reserves, are also
presented. Litigation reserves represent accruals for loss
contingencies that are both probable and reasonably
estimable, but exclude standard business-related legal fees.
Total revenue, noninterest expense, net income applicable
to common shareholders of The Bank of New York Mellon
Corporation, diluted earnings per share and the effective
tax rate, excluding the notable items

mentioned above, are also provided. These measures are
provided to permit investors to view financial measures on
a basis consistent with how management views the
business.

The presentation of the growth rates of investment
management and performance fees on a constant currency
basis permits investors to assess the significance of
changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Growth rates
on a constant currency basis were determined by applying
the current period foreign currency exchange rates to the
prior period revenue. We believe that this presentation, as a
supplement to GAAP information, gives investors a clearer
picture of the related revenue results without the variability
caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

BNY Mellon has also included the adjusted pre-tax
operating margin – Non-GAAP, which is the pre-tax
operating margin for the Investment and Wealth
Management business segment, net of distribution and
servicing expense that was passed to third parties who
distribute or service our managed funds. We believe that
this measure is useful when evaluating the performance of
the Investment and Wealth Management business segment
relative to industry competitors.

Recent accounting and regulatory developments

Recent accounting developments

The following accounting guidance issued by the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) has not yet been
adopted as of Sept. 30, 2023.

Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-02,
Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic
323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures
Using the Proportional Amortization Method

In March 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-02,
Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using
the Proportional Amortization Method, which permits
reporting entities to elect to account for their tax equity
investments, regardless of the tax credit program from
which the income tax credits are received, using the
proportional amortization method if certain conditions are
met. Under the proportional amortization method, an entity
amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to
the income tax credits and other income tax benefits
received, and recognizes the net amortization and income
tax credits and other income tax benefits in the income
statement as a component of the provision for income
taxes.

This ASU is effective Jan. 1, 2024 with early adoption
permitted. BNY Mellon is currently evaluating this
guidance with respect to our investments in renewable
energy projects, which historically have not been eligible
to apply the proportional amortization method. These
investments currently generate losses in investment and
other revenue that are more than offset by benefits and
credits recorded to the provision for income taxes. The
impact of adopting this new guidance for our renewable
energy investments that meet the eligibility criteria would
be an increase in investment and other revenue and an
increase in the provision for income taxes on the
consolidated income statement.

Recent regulatory and other developments

For a summary of additional regulatory matters relevant to
our operations, see “Recent regulatory developments” in
our Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2023 and
June 30, 2023, and “Supervision and Regulation” in our
2022 Annual

Report. The following discussion summarizes certain
regulatory, legislative and other developments that may
affect BNY Mellon.

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) Special
Assessment

On May 11, 2023, the FDIC proposed a rule to impose a
special assessment on insured depository institutions
(“IDIs”) to recover losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund
(“DIF”) associated with the closures of Silicon Valley
Bank and Signature Bank. Under the proposal, the FDIC
would collect from each IDI a special assessment at an
annual rate of approximately 12.5 basis points of the IDI’s
estimated uninsured deposits (excluding the first $5 billion
of estimated uninsured deposits), as of Dec. 31, 2022. For
an IDI that is part of a holding company containing
multiple IDIs, the $5 billion deduction would be
apportioned based on the IDI’s estimated uninsured
deposits as a percentage of total estimated uninsured
deposits held by all IDI affiliates in the consolidated
banking organization. The special assessment would be
collected during an initial special assessment period of
eight quarters, with the first quarterly assessment period
beginning on Jan. 1, 2024, subject to potential extension
and a potential one-time final special assessment for any
shortfall to the DIF. If the assessment is finalized as
proposed, we estimate a noninterest expense of
approximately $470 million to be recorded in the quarter in
which the rule is finalized, which would significantly affect
the results of operations for that quarter.

U.S. Regulatory Capital Requirements

On July 27, 2023, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation proposed substantial revisions to the
capital requirements applicable to large banking
organizations and to banking organizations with significant
trading activity, including BNY Mellon. The proposed
revisions would implement international capital standards
issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in
December 2017 to finalize the Basel III reforms, as well as
the Basel Committee’s revised standard for market risk
capital requirements finalized in February 2019. In
addition, on July 27, 2023, the Federal Reserve proposed
amendments to its rule regarding risk-based capital
surcharges for GSIBs, including BNY Mellon. The period
to submit comments on the proposals has been extended to
Jan.

BNY Mellon 47

16, 2024. We continue to assess the potential impact of the
proposals.

European Central Bank (“ECB”) remuneration on
minimum reserves

On July 27, 2023, the Governing Council of the ECB
established 0% as the remuneration of minimum reserves
credit institutions are required to hold with their
Eurosystem national central bank on average over a
maintenance period. The change became effective as of the
beginning of the reserve maintenance period starting Sept.
20, 2023.

FDIC Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company
Requirements

On Aug. 29, 2023, the Federal Reserve proposed
amendments to its total loss-absorbing capacity (“TLAC”)
rule applicable to G-SIBs, including BNY Mellon. Among
other requirements, the proposal would (i) require a
$400,000 minimum denomination for newly issued long-
term debt of G-SIBs used to satisfy TLAC and long-term
debt requirements and (ii) subject to notice and comment
procedures, require a G-SIB to maintain an amount of
eligible TLAC or long-term debt instruments greater or
less than generally required under the rule. The proposal
would also exempt certain agreements from the scope of
the TLAC rule’s clean holding company prohibitions with
respect to qualified financial contracts with third parties.
Comments on the proposed rule are due by Nov. 30, 2023.
We are evaluating the potential impact of the proposed
rule.

without a corresponding policy and related controls to
invest at least 80% of the fund’s net asset value (plus
certain borrowings) in the manner suggested by the fund’s
name (“80% Policy”), including names that reference
“growth” or “value,” or a name indicating that investment
decisions incorporate any environmental, social and
governance factors. The amendments will become effective
60 days after publication in the Federal Register and fund
groups will have either 24 months or 30 months to come
into compliance, depending upon their net asset size.

SEC Money Market Fund Reforms

On July 12, 2023, the SEC adopted amendments to rules
that govern money market funds. The amendments became
effective Oct. 2, 2023, with tiered compliance dates. The
amendments include, among other things: (i) a mandatory
liquidity fee for institutional prime and institutional tax-
exempt money market funds, which will apply when a fund
experiences daily net redemptions that exceed 5% of net
assets (effective Oct. 2, 2023); (ii) maintenance of a fund
board’s ability to impose liquidity fees (not to exceed 2%
of the value of the shares redeemed) on a discretionary
basis for non-government money market funds (effective
April 2, 2024), (iii) substantially increasing the required
minimum levels of daily and weekly liquid assets for all
money market funds from 10% and 30%, to 25% and 50%,
respectively (effective April 2, 2024), and (iv) removal of a
money market fund’s ability to impose temporary “gates”
to suspend redemptions in order to prevent dilution and
remove the link between a money market fund’s liquidity
level and its imposition of liquidity fees (effective Oct. 2,
2023).

FDIC Resolution Planning for Large Banks

California Climate Disclosure Laws

On Aug. 29, 2023, the FDIC proposed revisions to the
resolution plan rule applicable to covered IDIs. The
proposed amendment would expand certain IDI resolution
plan content requirements, adjust the frequency of
resolution plan submissions from a 3-year cycle to a 2-year
cycle, and require supplemental submissions of
information in the interim period between filing years.
Comments on the proposed rule are due by Nov. 30, 2023.
We are evaluating the potential impact of the proposed
rule.

SEC Naming Convention Rules for Funds

On Sept. 20, 2023, the SEC adopted amendments
expanding the scope of terms that the SEC considers
materially deceptive and misleading in a fund’s name

48 BNY Mellon

On Oct. 7, 2023, California enacted three climate-related
bills imposing extensive new climate-related disclosure
obligations applicable to companies doing business in
California. The Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act
(SB 253) requires covered companies with total annual
revenues of $1 billion or more to disclose annually their
Scope 1 (owned and controlled sources) and Scope 2 (from
energy purchased and used) greenhouse gas emissions
beginning in 2026, and Scope 3 (up and down value chain)
greenhouse gas emissions beginning in 2027. The Climate-
Related Financial Risk Act (SB 261) requires covered
companies with total annual revenues of $500 million or
more to publish biennial

reports disclosing climate-related financial risks and the
measures adopted to mitigate the disclosed risks by Jan. 1,
2026. The Voluntary Carbon Market Disclosures Act (AB
1305), effective Jan. 1, 2024, requires companies making
certain claims, including regarding carbon neutrality or
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and companies
purchasing carbon offsets in addition to making such
claims, to disclose information on the determination of
accuracy of the claim, interim progress measures, third-
party verification and, if applicable, information on the
carbon offsets purchased and emissions data. The laws may
be modified by future legislation. We are assessing the
potential impact of the climate disclosure laws.

Federal Reserve Novel Activities Supervisory Program

On Aug. 8, 2023, the Federal Reserve issued a Supervision
and Regulation Letter (SR 23-7) announcing the
establishment of its Novel Activities Supervision Program
(“NAS Program”) to complement its existing supervision
and oversight of supervised banking organizations,
including BNY Mellon. The NAS Program will encompass
risk-based monitoring and examination and focus on novel
activities related to crypto-assets, distributed ledger
technology, and complex, technology-driven partnerships
with nonbank providers of banking products and services
to customers. We are evaluating the potential impact of the
NAS Program.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

BNY Mellon 57

Note 1–Basis of presentation

In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, references to
“our,” “we,” “us,” “BNY Mellon,” the “Company” and
similar terms refer to The Bank of New York Mellon
Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. The term
“Parent” refers to The Bank of New York Mellon
Corporation but not to its subsidiaries.

Basis of presentation

The accounting and financial reporting policies of BNY
Mellon, a global financial services company, conform to
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”)
and prevailing industry practices. For information on our
significant accounting and reporting policies, see Note 1 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31,
2022 (the “2022 Annual Report”).

The accompanying consolidated financial statements are
unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments
necessary, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, for a
fair presentation of financial position, results of operations
and cash flows for the periods presented have been made.
These financial statements should be read in conjunction
with our Consolidated Financial Statements included in our
2022 Annual Report. Certain additional immaterial
reclassifications have been made to prior periods to place
them on a basis comparable with the current period
presentation.

Use of estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates based
upon assumptions about future economic and market
conditions which affect reported amounts and related
disclosures in our financial statements. Although our
current estimates contemplate current conditions and how
we expect them to change in the future, it is reasonably
possible that actual conditions could be worse than
anticipated in those estimates, which could materially
affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Note 2–New accounting guidance

The following accounting guidance was adopted in the first
quarter of 2023.

58 BNY Mellon

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2022-01,
Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value Hedging
– Portfolio Layer Method

In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-01,
Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value Hedging
– Portfolio Layer Method, which provides guidance that
expands the ability to hedge interest rate risk by permitting
the use of multiple hedged layers of a single closed
portfolio of assets and will (1) Allow multiple layer
hedging within the same closed portfolio, (2) Expand the
scope of the portfolio layer method to include non-
prepayable assets, (3) Expand the eligible hedging
instruments to be utilized in a single-layer hedge, and (4)
Permit held-to-maturity debt securities to be transferred to
available-for-sale at the date of adoption, provided such
transferred securities are designated in a portfolio layer
method hedge within 30 days of the adoption date.

The standard also provides further guidance and disclosure
requirements with respect to hedge basis adjustments
related to portfolio layer method hedges.

We adopted this guidance as of Jan. 1, 2023. The Company
did not choose to make the one-time election to reclassify
securities classified as held-to-maturity to available-for-
sale as of Jan. 1, 2023 and can choose to prospectively
apply portfolio layer method hedging.

ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses
(Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage
Disclosures

In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Financial
Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt
Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures, which provides
post-implementation guidance related to the adoption of
ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses:
Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,
which was effective Jan. 1, 2020. This ASU amends the
guidance related to two issues: Troubled Debt
Restructurings (“TDRs”) and disclosure requirements for
the credit profile of the loan portfolio. This ASU eliminates
the accounting guidance for TDRs by creditors, while
enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan
refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a
borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. An entity
must apply the loan refinancing and restructuring guidance
to determine whether a

modification results in a new loan or a continuation of an
existing loan.

This ASU also requires that an entity disclose current-
period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing
receivables and net investments in leases within the scope
of Subtopic 326-20, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses
– Measured at Amortized Cost.

We adopted the revised guidance related to loan
modifications on Jan. 1, 2023. The impact was immaterial.
The updated disclosures are included in Note 5.

Note 3–Acquisitions and dispositions

We sometimes structure our acquisitions and divestitures
with both an initial payment or receipt and later contingent
payments or receipts tied to post-closing revenue or
income growth. Contingent payments totaled $5 million in
the first nine months of 2023. There were no contingent
receipts in the first nine months of 2023. At Sept. 30, 2023,
we are potentially obligated to pay additional consideration
which, using reasonable assumptions and estimates, could
range from $25 million to $40 million over the next two
years. At Sept. 30, 2023, we could potentially receive
additional consideration which, using reasonable
assumptions and estimates, could be up to $390 million
over the next five years.

See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements in our 2022 Annual Report for information
related to the 2022 transactions.

(a)    The amortized cost of available-for-sale securities is net of the

allowance for credit losses of $1 million. The allowance for credit loss
primarily relates to non-agency RMBS.

(b)    Includes gross unrealized gains of $347 million and gross unrealized
losses of $179 million recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
income related to securities that were transferred from available-for-
sale to held-to-maturity. The unrealized gains primarily relate to
agency RMBS, U.S. Treasury securities and agency commercial MBS.
The unrealized losses primarily relate to agency RMBS and U.S.
Treasury securities. The unrealized gains and losses will be amortized
into net interest revenue over the contractual lives of the securities.

The allowance for credit losses related to securities was
$1 million at Sept. 30, 2023 and $1 million at Dec. 31,
2022, and relates to state and political subdivision and non-
agency RMBS securities.

Credit quality indicators – Securities

At Sept. 30, 2023, the gross unrealized losses on the
securities portfolio were primarily attributable to an
increase in interest rates from the date of purchase, and for
certain securities that were transferred from available-for-
sale to held-to-maturity, an increase in interest rates
through the date they were transferred. Specifically, $153
million of the unrealized losses at Sept. 30, 2023 and $179
million at Dec. 31, 2022 reflected in the tables below relate
to certain securities that were previously transferred from
available-for-sale to held-to-maturity. The unrealized losses
will be amortized into net interest revenue over the
contractual lives of the securities. The transfer created a
new cost basis for the securities. As a result, if these
securities have experienced unrealized losses since the date
of transfer, the corresponding unrealized losses would be
reflected in the held-to-maturity securities portfolio in the
following tables. We do not intend to sell these securities,
and it is not more likely than not that we will have to sell
these securities.

The following tables show the credit quality of the held-to-maturity securities. We have included certain credit ratings
information because the information can indicate the degree of credit risk to which we are exposed. Significant changes in
ratings classifications could indicate increased credit risk for us and could be accompanied by an increase in the allowance for
credit losses and/or a reduction in the fair value of our securities portfolio.

Pledged assets

At Sept. 30, 2023, BNY Mellon had pledged assets of $127
billion, including $95 billion pledged as collateral for
potential borrowings at the Federal Reserve Discount
Window and $9 billion pledged as collateral for borrowing
at the Federal Home Loan Bank. The components of the
assets pledged at Sept. 30, 2023 included $109 billion of
securities, $13 billion of loans, $4 billion of trading assets
and $1 billion of interest-bearing deposits with banks.

If there has been no borrowing at the Federal Reserve
Discount Window, the Federal Reserve generally allows
banks to freely move assets in and out of their pledged
assets account to sell or repledge the assets

for other purposes. BNY Mellon regularly moves assets in
and out of its pledged assets account at the Federal Reserve
as there have been no borrowings.

At Dec. 31, 2022, BNY Mellon had pledged assets of $138
billion, including $106 billion pledged as collateral for
potential borrowing at the Federal Reserve Discount
Window and $8 billion pledged as collateral for borrowing
at the Federal Home Loan Bank. The components of the
assets pledged at Dec. 31, 2022 included $121 billion of
securities, $12 billion of loans, $4 billion of trading assets
and $1 billion of interest-bearing deposits with banks.

At Sept. 30, 2023 and Dec. 31, 2022, pledged assets
included $23 billion and $24 billion, respectively, for

which the recipients were permitted to sell or repledge the
assets delivered.

Note 5–Loans and asset quality

Loans

We also obtain securities as collateral, including receipts
under resale agreements, securities borrowed, derivative
contracts and custody agreements, on terms which permit
us to sell or repledge the securities to others. At Sept. 30,
2023 and Dec. 31, 2022, the market value of the securities
received that can be sold or repledged was $191 billion and
$115 billion, respectively. We routinely sell or repledge
these securities through delivery to third parties. As of
Sept. 30, 2023 and Dec. 31, 2022, the market value of
securities collateral sold or repledged was $163 billion and
$78 billion, respectively.

Restricted cash and securities

Cash and securities may be segregated under federal and
other regulations or requirements. At Sept. 30, 2023 and
Dec. 31, 2022, cash segregated under federal and other
regulations or requirements was $3 billion and $7 billion,
respectively. Restricted cash is primarily included in
interest-bearing deposits with banks on the consolidated
balance sheet. Securities segregated under federal and
other regulations or requirements were $3 billion at Sept.
30, 2023 and $3 billion at Dec. 31, 2022. Restricted
securities were sourced from securities purchased under
resale agreements and are included in federal funds sold
and securities purchased under resale agreements on the
consolidated balance sheet.

Loan modifications

Modified loans are evaluated to determine whether a
modification or restructuring with a borrower experiencing
financial difficulty results in principal forgiveness, an
interest rate reduction, an other-than-insignificant payment
delay, or a term extension. The modification could result in
a new loan or a continuation of the existing loan.

In the third quarter of 2023, we modified one other
residential mortgage loan, with an aggregate recorded
investment of less than $1 million, by providing payment
modifications.

In the second quarter of 2023, we modified one
commercial real estate exposure, with a recorded
investment of $59 million and an unfunded lending
commitment of $15 million, by extending the maturity
date. We also modified two other residential mortgage
loans, with an aggregate recorded investment of less than
$1 million, by extending the maturity dates and reducing
the interest rates.

We modified one commercial real estate loan in the first
quarter of 2023, with a recorded investment of $12 million,
by extending the maturity date.

Loans modified prior to 2023 are considered to be TDRs if
the debtor is experiencing financial difficulties and the
creditor grants a concession to the debtor that would not
otherwise be considered. A TDR may include a transfer of
real estate or other assets from the debtor to the creditor, or
a modification of the term of the loan. Not all modified
loans are considered TDRs.

We modified eight loans in the first nine months of 2022
with an aggregate recorded investment of $13 million. The
modifications of the other residential and commercial real
estate loans in the first nine months of 2022 consisted of
reducing the stated interest rates and, in certain cases,
forbearance of default and extending the maturity dates.

Credit quality indicators

Our credit strategy is to focus on investment-grade clients that are active users of our non-credit services. Each customer is
assigned an internal credit rating, which is mapped to an external rating agency grade equivalent, if possible, based upon a
number of dimensions, which are continually evaluated and may change over time. The tables below provide information about
the credit profile of the loan portfolio by the period of origination.

(a)    Excludes overdrafts of $4,839 million. Overdrafts occur on a daily basis primarily in the custody and securities clearance business and are generally repaid within two

business days.

Commercial loans

The commercial loan portfolio is divided into investment
grade and non-investment grade categories based on the
assigned internal credit ratings, which are generally
consistent with those of the public rating agencies.
Customers with ratings consistent with BBB- (S&P)/Baa3
(Moody’s) or better are considered to be investment grade.
Those clients with ratings lower than this threshold are
considered to be non-investment grade.

Commercial real estate

Our income-producing commercial real estate facilities are
focused on experienced owners and are structured with
moderate leverage based on existing cash flows. Our
commercial real estate lending activities also include
construction and renovation facilities.

Financial institutions

Financial institution exposures are high quality, with 94%
of the exposures meeting the investment grade

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

equivalent criteria of our internal credit rating
classification at Sept. 30, 2023. In addition, 64% of the
financial institutions exposure is secured. For example,
securities industry clients and asset managers often borrow
against marketable securities held in custody. The exposure
to financial institutions is generally short term, with 84%
expiring within one year.

Wealth management loans

Wealth management loans are not typically rated by
external rating agencies. A majority of the wealth
management loans are secured by the customers’
investment management accounts or custody accounts.
Eligible assets pledged for these loans are typically
investment grade fixed-income securities, equities and/or
mutual funds. Internal ratings for this portion of the wealth
management loan portfolio, therefore, would equate to
investment grade external ratings. Wealth management
loans are provided to select customers based on the pledge
of other types of assets. For the loans collateralized by
other assets, the credit quality of the obligor is carefully
analyzed,

BNY Mellon 69

but we do not consider this portion of our wealth
management loan portfolio to be investment grade.

Wealth management mortgages

Credit quality indicators for wealth management mortgages
are not correlated to external ratings. Wealth management
mortgages are typically loans to high-net-worth
individuals, which are secured primarily by residential
property. These loans are primarily interest-only,
adjustable-rate mortgages with a weighted-average loan-to-
value ratio of 61% at origination. Delinquency rate is a key
indicator of credit quality in our wealth management
portfolio. At Sept. 30, 2023, less than 1% of the mortgages
were past due.

At Sept. 30, 2023, the wealth management mortgage
portfolio consisted of the following geographic
concentrations: California – 21%; New York – 14%;
Florida – 11%; Massachusetts – 8%; and other – 46%.

Lease financings

At Sept. 30, 2023, the lease financings portfolio consisted
of exposures backed by well-diversified assets, primarily
real estate and large-ticket transportation equipment. The
largest components of our lease residual value exposure
relate to freight-related rail cars and aircraft. Assets are
both domestic and foreign-based, with primary
concentrations in Germany and the U.S.

Other residential mortgages

The other residential mortgages portfolio primarily consists
of 1-4 family residential mortgage loans and totaled $1.0
billion at Sept. 30, 2023 and $345 million at Dec. 31, 2022.
Included in this portfolio at Sept. 30, 2023 were $750
million of fixed-rate jumbo mortgage loans, purchased
primarily in the first

quarter of 2023, with a weighted-average loan-to-value
ratio of 73% at origination. These loans are not typically
correlated to external ratings.

Capital call financing

Capital call financing includes loans to private equity funds
that are secured by the fund investors’ capital commitments
and the funds’ right to call capital.

Other loans

Other loans primarily include loans to consumers that are
fully collateralized with equities, mutual funds and fixed-
income securities.

Margin loans

We had $17.2 billion of secured margin loans at Sept. 30,
2023, compared with $16.9 billion at Dec. 31, 2022.
Margin loans are collateralized with marketable securities,
and borrowers are required to maintain a daily collateral
margin in excess of 100% of the value of the loan. We have
rarely suffered a loss on these types of loans.

Overdrafts

Overdrafts primarily relate to custody and securities
clearance clients and totaled $3.6 billion at Sept. 30, 2023
and $4.8 billion at Dec. 31, 2022. Overdrafts occur on a
daily basis and are generally repaid within two business
days.

Reverse repurchase agreements

Reverse repurchase agreements at Sept. 30, 2023 and Dec.
31, 2022 were fully secured with high-quality collateral. As
a result, there was no allowance for credit losses related to
these assets at Sept. 30, 2023 and Dec. 31, 2022.

Non-readily marketable equity securities

Non-readily marketable equity securities do not have
readily determinable fair values. These investments are
valued using a measurement alternative where the
investments are carried at cost, less any impairment, and
plus or minus changes resulting from observable price
changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar
investment of the same issuer. The observable price
changes are recorded in investment and other revenue on
the consolidated income statement. Our non-readily
marketable equity securities totaled $420 million at Sept.
30, 2023 and $445 million at Dec. 31, 2022, and are
included in other equity investments in the table above.

Qualified affordable housing project investments

We invest in affordable housing projects primarily to
satisfy the Company’s requirements under the Community
Reinvestment Act. Our total investment in qualified
affordable housing projects totaled $1.2 billion at Sept. 30,
2023 and $1.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2022. Commitments to
fund future investments in qualified affordable housing
projects totaled $589 million at Sept. 30, 2023 and $614
million at Dec. 31, 2022 and are recorded in other
liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. A summary of
the commitments to fund future investments is as follows:
remainder of 2023 – $175 million; 2024 – $137 million;
2025 – $183 million; 2026 – $24 million; 2027 – $28
million; and 2028 and thereafter – $42 million.

Tax credits and other tax benefits recognized were $45
million in the third quarter of 2023, $45 million in the
second quarter of 2023, $38 million in the third quarter of
2022, $135 million in the first nine months of 2023 and
$114 million in the first nine months of 2022.

Amortization expense included in the provision for income
taxes was $38 million in the third quarter of 2023, $38
million in the second quarter of 2023, $32 million in the

primarily small business investment companies (“SBICs”),
which are compliant with the Volcker Rule, and certain
other corporate

Note 8–Contract revenue

Fee and other revenue in the Securities Services, Market
and Wealth Services and Investment and Wealth
Management business segments is primarily variable,
based on levels of assets under custody and/or
administration, assets under management and the level of
client-driven transactions, as specified in the fee schedules.
See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements in our 2022 Annual Report for information on
the nature of our services and revenue recognition. See
Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
in our 2022 Annual Report for additional information on
our principal business segments — Securities Services,

Market and Wealth Services and Investment and Wealth
Management — and the primary services provided.

Disaggregation of contract revenue

Contract revenue is included in fee and other revenue on
the consolidated income statement. The following tables
present fee and other revenue related to contracts with
customers, disaggregated by type of fee revenue, for each
business segment. Business segment data has been
determined on an internal management basis of accounting,
rather than GAAP, which is used for consolidated financial

management funds of $4 million in the first nine months of 2023 and $(13) million in the first nine months of 2022.

Contract balances

Our clients are billed based on fee schedules that are
agreed upon in each customer contract. Receivables from
customers were $2.6 billion at Sept. 30, 2023 and Dec. 31,
2022.

Contract assets represent accrued revenues that have not
yet been billed to customers due to certain contractual
terms other than the passage of time and were $49 million
at Sept. 30, 2023 and $48 million at Dec. 31, 2022.
Accrued revenues recorded as contract assets are usually
billed on an annual basis.

Both receivables from customers and contract assets are
included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.

Contract liabilities represent payments received in advance
of providing services under certain contracts and were
$205 million at Sept. 30, 2023 and $164 million at Dec. 31,
2022. Contract liabilities are included in other liabilities on
the consolidated balance sheet. Revenue recognized in the
first nine months of 2023 relating to contract liabilities as
of Dec. 31, 2022 was $104 million. Revenue recognized in
the third quarter of 2023 relating to contract liabilities as of
June 30, 2023 was $77 million.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

BNY Mellon 75

Changes in contract assets and liabilities primarily relate to
either party’s performance under the contracts.

Contract costs

Incremental costs for obtaining contracts that are deemed
recoverable are capitalized as contract costs. Such costs
result from the payment of sales incentives, primarily in
the Wealth Management business, and totaled $51 million
at Sept. 30, 2023 and $58 million at Dec. 31, 2022.
Capitalized sales incentives are amortized based on the
transfer of goods or services to which the assets relate. The
amortization of capitalized sales incentives, which is
included in staff expense on the consolidated income
statement, totaled $4 million in the third quarter of 2023,
$5 million in the third quarter of 2022, $4 million in the
second quarter of 2023, $12 million in the first nine
months of 2023 and $14 million in the first nine months of
2022.

Costs to fulfill a contract are capitalized when they relate
directly to an existing contract or a specific

Note 9–Net interest revenue

anticipated contract, generate or enhance resources that
will be used to fulfill performance obligations, and are
recoverable. Such costs generally represent set-up costs,
which include any direct cost incurred at the inception of a
contract which enables the fulfillment of the performance
obligation, and totaled $88 million at Sept. 30, 2023 and
$77 million at Dec. 31, 2022. These capitalized costs are
amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected
contract period.

Unsatisfied performance obligations

We do not have any unsatisfied performance obligations
other than those that are subject to a practical expedient
election under ASC 606, Revenue From Contracts With
Customers. The practical expedient election applies to (i)
contracts with an original expected length of one year or
less, and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at
the amount to which we have the right to invoice for
services performed.

Note 11–Income taxes

BNY Mellon recorded an income tax provision of $241
million (18.8% effective tax rate) in the third quarter of
2023. The income tax provision was $242 million (38.4%
effective tax rate) in the third quarter of 2022, which
includes approximately 19% impact due to the goodwill
impairment. The income tax provision was $270 million
(20.2% effective tax rate) in the second quarter of 2023.

Our total tax reserves as of Sept. 30, 2023 were $109
million, compared with $106 million at Dec. 31, 2022. If
these tax reserves were unnecessary, $109 million would
affect the effective tax rate in future periods. We recognize
accrued interest and penalties, if applicable, related to
income taxes in income tax expense. Included in the
balance sheet at Sept. 30, 2023 is accrued interest, where
applicable, of $36 million. The additional tax expense
related to interest for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2023
was $3 million, compared with $3 million for the nine
months ended Sept. 30, 2022.

It is reasonably possible the total reserve for uncertain tax
positions could decrease within the next 12 months by
approximately $9 million as a result of

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

adjustments related to tax years that are still subject to
examination.

Our federal income tax returns are closed to examination
through 2016. Our New York State and New York City
income tax returns are closed to examination through 2014.
Our UK income tax returns are closed to examination
through 2020.

Note 12–Variable interest entities

We have variable interests in variable interest entities
(“VIEs”), which include investments in retail, institutional
and alternative investment funds.

We earn management fees from these funds, as well as
performance fees in certain funds, and may also provide
start-up capital for new funds. The funds are primarily
financed by our customers’ investments in the funds’ equity
or debt.

Additionally, we invest in qualified affordable housing and
renewable energy projects, which are designed to generate
a return primarily through the realization of tax credits.
The projects, which are structured as limited partnerships
and limited liability companies, are also VIEs, but are not
consolidated.

of the VIE and to settle any investors’ ownership

We have not provided financial or other support that was

VIEs. Additionally, creditors of any consolidated VIEs do
not have any recourse to the general credit of BNY Mellon.

Non-consolidated VIEs

As of Sept. 30, 2023 and Dec. 31, 2022, assets and

(a)    Includes the impact of hedges of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. See Note 17 for additional information.

(b)    The reclassification adjustment related to the unrealized gain (loss) on assets available-for-sale is recorded as net securities gains, which is included in investment and
other revenue on the consolidated income statement. The amortization of prior service credit, net loss and initial obligation included in net periodic benefit cost is

recorded as other expense on the consolidated income statement.

Note 15–Fair value measurement

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to
sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the
measurement date. A three-level hierarchy for fair value
measurements is utilized based upon the transparency of
inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the
measurement date. BNY Mellon’s own creditworthiness is
considered when valuing liabilities. See Note 20 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2022
Annual Report for

information on how we determine fair value and the fair
value hierarchy.

The following tables present the financial instruments
carried at fair value at Sept. 30, 2023 and Dec. 31, 2022,
by caption on the consolidated balance sheet and by the
three-level valuation hierarchy. We have included credit
ratings information in certain of the tables because the
information indicates the degree of credit risk to which we
are exposed, and significant changes in ratings
classifications could result in increased risk for us.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis

Under certain circumstances, we make adjustments to the fair value of our assets, liabilities and unfunded lending-related
commitments, although they are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis. The following table presents the carrying value
as of Sept. 30, 2023 and Dec. 31, 2022 of financial instruments for which nonrecurring adjustments to fair value have been
recorded during 2023 and/or 2022 and all non-readily marketable equity securities carried at cost with upward or downward
adjustments by balance sheet caption and level in the fair value hierarchy.

Note 16–Fair value option

We elected fair value as an alternative measurement for
selected financial assets and liabilities that are not
otherwise required to be measured at fair value, including
the assets and liabilities of consolidated investment
management funds and subordinated notes associated with
certain equity investments.

The following table presents the assets and liabilities of
consolidated investment management funds, at fair value.

The assets and liabilities of the consolidated investment
management funds are included in other assets and other
liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. We value the
assets and liabilities of consolidated investment
management funds using quoted prices for identical assets
or liabilities in

active markets or observable inputs such as quoted prices
for similar assets or liabilities. Quoted prices for either
identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets
may also be used. Accordingly, fair value best reflects the
interests BNY Mellon holds in the economic performance
of the consolidated investment management funds.
Changes in the fair value of the assets and liabilities are
recorded as income (loss) from consolidated investment
management funds, which is included in investment and
other revenue on the consolidated income statement.

We elected the fair value option on subordinated notes
associated with certain equity investments. The fair value
of these subordinated notes was $8 million at Sept. 30,
2023 and $10 million at Dec. 31, 2022. The subordinated
notes were valued using observable market inputs and
included in Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.

Note 17–Derivative instruments

We use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk,
including interest rate risk, equity price risk and foreign
currency risk, as well as credit risk. Our trading activities
are focused on acting as a market-maker for our customers
and facilitating customer trades in compliance with the
Volcker Rule.

The notional amounts for derivative financial instruments
express the dollar volume of the transactions; however,
credit risk is much smaller.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

BNY Mellon 85

We perform credit reviews and enter into netting
agreements and collateral arrangements to minimize the
credit risk of derivative financial instruments. We enter
into offsetting positions to reduce exposure to foreign
currency, interest rate and equity price risk.

Use of derivative financial instruments involves reliance
on counterparties. Failure of a counterparty to honor its
obligation under a derivative contract is a risk we assume
whenever we engage in a derivative contract. There were
no counterparty default losses recorded in the third quarter
of 2023.

Hedging derivatives

We utilize interest rate swap agreements to manage our
exposure to interest rate fluctuations. We enter into fair
value hedges as an interest rate risk management strategy
to reduce fair value variability by converting certain fixed
rate interest payments associated with available-for-sale
securities and long-term debt to floating interest rates. We
also utilize interest rate swaps and forward exchange
contracts as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to
interest rate and foreign exchange rate changes.

The available-for-sale securities hedged consist of U.S.
Treasury, agency and non-agency commercial MBS,
sovereign debt/sovereign guaranteed and foreign covered
bonds. At Sept. 30, 2023, $31.4 billion par value of
available-for-sale securities were hedged with interest rate
swaps designated as fair value hedges that had notional
values of $31.4 billion.

The fixed rate long-term debt instruments hedged generally
have original maturities of five to 30 years. In fair value
hedging relationships, fixed rate debt is hedged with
“receive fixed rate, pay variable rate” swaps. At Sept. 30,
2023, $22.7 billion par value of debt was hedged with
interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges that had
notional values of $22.7 billion.

In addition, we utilize forward foreign exchange contracts
as hedges to mitigate foreign exchange

86 BNY Mellon

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

exposures. We use forward foreign exchange contracts as
cash flow hedges to convert certain forecasted non-U.S.
dollar revenue and expenses into U.S. dollars. We use
forward foreign exchange contracts with maturities of 18
months or less as cash flow hedges to hedge our foreign
exchange exposure to currencies such as the Indian rupee,
Polish zloty, Hong Kong dollar, Singapore dollar, British
pound and euro used in revenue and expense transactions
for entities that have the U.S. dollar as their functional
currency. As of Sept. 30, 2023, the hedged forecasted
foreign currency transactions and designated forward
foreign exchange contract hedges were $639 million
(notional), with a net pre-tax gain of $4 million recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income (“OCI”). This
gain will be reclassified to earnings over the next 12
months.

In 2022, we utilized forward foreign exchange contracts as
fair value hedges of the foreign exchange risk associated
with available-for-sale securities. At Sept. 30, 2023, there
were no remaining foreign exchange contracts. Forward
points are designated as an excluded component and
amortized into earnings over the hedge period.

Forward foreign exchange contracts are also used to hedge
the value of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
These forward foreign exchange contracts have maturities
of less than one year. The derivatives employed are
designated as hedges of changes in value of our foreign
investments due to exchange rates. The change in fair
market value of these forward foreign exchange contracts
is reported within foreign currency translation adjustments
in shareholders’ equity, net of tax. At Sept. 30, 2023,
forward foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts
totaling $9.4 billion were designated as net investment
hedges.

From time to time, we also designate non-derivative
financial instruments as hedges of our net investments in
foreign subsidiaries. At Sept. 30, 2023, there were no non-
derivative financial instruments hedging our net
investments in foreign subsidiaries.

the consolidated income statement.

(b)    For derivative transactions settled at clearing organizations, cash collateral exchanged is deemed a settlement of the derivative each day. The
settlement reduces the gross fair value of derivative assets and liabilities and results in a corresponding decrease in the effect of master netting
agreements, with no impact to the consolidated balance sheet.

(c)    The fair value of asset derivatives and liability derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is recorded as trading assets and trading liabilities,

respectively, on the consolidated balance sheet.

(d)    Fair values are on a gross basis, before consideration of master netting agreements, as required by ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging.
(e)    Effect of master netting agreements includes cash collateral received and paid of $1,909 million and $1,044 million, respectively, at Sept. 30, 2023,

Trading activities (including trading derivatives)

Our trading activities are focused on acting as a market-
maker for our customers, facilitating customer trades and
risk-mitigating economic hedging in compliance with the
Volcker Rule. The change in the fair value of the
derivatives utilized in our trading activities is recorded in
foreign exchange revenue and investment and other
revenue on the consolidated income statement.

The following table presents our foreign exchange revenue
and other trading revenue.

Foreign exchange revenue includes income from
purchasing and selling foreign currencies, currency
forwards, futures and options as well as foreign currency
remeasurement. Other trading revenue reflects results from
trading in cash instruments, including fixed income and
equity securities, and

trading and economic hedging activity with non-foreign
exchange derivatives.

We also use derivative financial instruments as risk-
mitigating economic hedges, which are not formally
designated as accounting hedges. This includes hedging the
foreign currency, interest rate or market risks inherent in
some of our balance sheet exposures, such as seed capital
investments and deposits, as well as certain investment
management fee revenue streams. We also use total return
swaps to economically hedge obligations arising from the
Company’s deferred compensation plan whereby the
participants defer compensation and earn a return linked to
the performance of investments they select. The gains or
losses on these total return swaps are recorded in staff
expense on the consolidated income statement and were
losses of $11 million in the third quarter of 2023 and $11
million in the third quarter of 2022, gains of $8 million in
the second quarter of 2023 and $4 million in the first nine
months of 2023 and a loss of $54 million in the first nine
months of 2022.

We manage trading risk through a system of position
limits, a value-at-risk (“VaR”) methodology based on
historical simulation and other market sensitivity

 
 
88 BNY Mellon

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

measures. Risk is monitored and reported to senior
management by a separate unit, independent from trading,
on a daily basis. Based on certain assumptions, the VaR
methodology is designed to capture the potential overnight
pre-tax dollar loss from adverse changes in fair values of
all trading positions. The calculation assumes a one-day
holding period, utilizes a 99% confidence level and
incorporates non-linear product characteristics. The VaR
model is one of several statistical models used to develop
economic capital results, which are allocated to lines of
business for computing risk-adjusted performance.

VaR methodology does not evaluate risk attributable to
extraordinary financial, economic or other occurrences. As
a result, the risk assessment process includes a number of
stress scenarios based upon the risk factors in the portfolio
and management’s assessment of market conditions.
Additional stress scenarios based upon historical market
events are also performed. Stress tests may incorporate the
impact of reduced market liquidity and the breakdown of
historically observed correlations and extreme scenarios.
VaR and other statistical measures, stress testing and
sensitivity analysis are incorporated into other risk
management materials.

Counterparty credit risk and collateral

We assess the credit risk of our counterparties through
regular examination of their financial statements,
confidential communication with the management of those
counterparties and regular monitoring of publicly available
credit rating information. This and other information is
used to develop proprietary credit rating metrics used to
assess credit quality.

Collateral requirements are determined after a
comprehensive review of the credit quality of each
counterparty. Collateral is generally held or pledged in the
form of cash and/or highly liquid government securities.
Collateral requirements are monitored and adjusted daily.

Additional disclosures concerning derivative financial
instruments are provided in Note 15.

Disclosure of contingent features in over-the-counter
(“OTC”) derivative instruments

Certain OTC derivative contracts and/or collateral
agreements contain credit risk-contingent features

triggered upon a rating downgrade in which the
counterparty has the right to request additional collateral or
the right to terminate the contracts in a net liability
position.

The following table shows the aggregate fair value of OTC
derivative contracts in net liability positions that contained
credit risk-contingent features and the value of collateral
that has been posted.

The aggregate fair value of OTC derivative contracts

The Bank of New York Mellon, our largest banking
subsidiary, enters into the substantial majority of our OTC
derivative contracts and/or collateral agreements. As such,
the contingent features may be triggered if The Bank of
New York Mellon’s long-term issuer rating were
downgraded.

BNY Mellon’s repurchase agreements and securities
lending transactions primarily encounter risk associated
with liquidity. We are required to pledge collateral based
on predetermined terms within the agreements. If we were
to experience a decline in the fair value of the collateral
pledged for these transactions, we could be required to
provide additional collateral to the counterparty, therefore
decreasing the amount of assets available for other
liquidity needs that may arise. BNY Mellon also offers tri-
party collateral agency services in the tri-party repo market
where we are exposed to credit risk. In order to mitigate
this risk, we require dealers to fully secure intraday credit.

Note 18–Commitments and contingent liabilities

Off-balance sheet arrangements

In the normal course of business, various commitments and
contingent liabilities are outstanding that are not reflected
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Our significant trading and off-balance sheet risks are
securities, foreign currency and interest rate risk
management products, commercial lending commitments,
letters of credit and securities lending indemnifications. We
assume these risks to reduce interest rate and foreign
currency risks, to provide customers with the ability to
meet credit and liquidity needs and to hedge foreign
currency and interest rate risks. These items involve, to
varying degrees, credit, foreign currency and interest rate
risks not recognized on the balance sheet. Our off-balance
sheet risks are managed and monitored in manners similar
to those used for on-balance sheet risks.

acts as an agent on behalf of CIBC Mellon clients, which totaled
$60 billion at Sept. 30, 2023 and $64 billion at Dec. 31, 2022.
Includes cash collateral, invested in indemnified repurchase
agreements, held by us as securities lending agent of $48 billion at
Sept. 30, 2023 and $43 billion at Dec. 31, 2022.

(c)

The total potential loss on undrawn lending commitments,
standby and commercial letters of credit and securities
lending indemnifications is equal to the total notional
amount if drawn upon, which does not consider the value
of any collateral.

Since many of the lending commitments are expected to
expire without being drawn upon, the total amount does
not necessarily represent future cash requirements. A
summary of lending commitment maturities is as follows:
$28.8 billion in less than one year, $19.5 billion in one to
five years and $337 million over five years.

SBLCs principally support obligations of corporate clients
and were collateralized with cash and securities of $145
million at Sept. 30, 2023 and $144 million at Dec. 31,
2022. At Sept. 30, 2023, $1.3 billion of the SBLCs will
expire within one year, $634 million in one to five years
and $8 million over five years.

We must recognize, at the inception of an SBLC and
foreign and other guarantees, a liability for the fair value of
the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The fair
value of the liability, which was recorded with a
corresponding asset in other assets, was estimated as the
present value of contractual customer fees. The estimated
liability for losses related to SBLCs and foreign and other
guarantees, if any, is included in the allowance for lending-
related commitments.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Payment/performance risk of SBLCs is monitored using
both historical performance and internal ratings criteria.
BNY Mellon’s historical experience is that SBLCs
typically expire without being funded. SBLCs below
investment grade are monitored closely for
payment/performance risk. The table below shows SBLCs
by investment grade:

Standby letters of credit

Non-investment grade

A commercial letter of credit is normally a short-term
instrument used to finance a commercial contract for the
shipment of goods from a seller to a buyer. Although the
commercial letter of credit is contingent upon the
satisfaction of specified conditions, it represents a credit
exposure if the buyer defaults on the underlying
transaction. As a result, the total contractual amounts do
not necessarily represent future cash requirements.
Commercial letters of credit totaled $51 million at Sept.
30, 2023 and $19 million at Dec. 31, 2022.

We expect many of the lending commitments and letters of
credit to expire without the need to advance any cash. The
revenue associated with guarantees frequently depends on
the credit rating of the obligor and the structure of the
transaction, including collateral, if any. The allowance for
lending-related commitments was $85 million at Sept. 30,
2023 and $78 million at Dec. 31, 2022.

A securities lending transaction is a fully collateralized
transaction in which the owner of a security agrees to lend
the security (typically through an agent, in our case, The
Bank of New York Mellon) to a borrower, usually a broker-
dealer or bank, on an open, overnight or term basis, under
the terms of a prearranged contract.

We typically lend securities with indemnification against
borrower default. We generally require the borrower to
provide collateral with a minimum value of 102% of the
fair value of the securities borrowed, which is monitored
on a daily basis, thus reducing credit risk. Market risk can
also arise in securities lending transactions. These risks are
controlled through policies limiting the level of risk that
can be undertaken. Securities lending transactions are
generally entered into only with highly rated
counterparties. Securities lending indemnifications

BNY Mellon 93

were secured by collateral of $476 billion at Sept. 30, 2023
and $515 billion at Dec. 31, 2022.

CIBC Mellon, a joint venture between BNY Mellon and
the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (“CIBC”),
engages in securities lending activities.  CIBC Mellon,
BNY Mellon and CIBC jointly and severally indemnify
securities lenders against specific types of borrower
default. At Sept. 30, 2023 and Dec. 31, 2022, $60 billion
and $64 billion, respectively, of borrowings at CIBC
Mellon, for which BNY Mellon acts as agent on behalf of
CIBC Mellon clients, were secured by collateral of $63
billion and $68 billion, respectively. If, upon a default, a
borrower’s collateral was not sufficient to cover its related
obligations, certain losses related to the indemnification
could be covered by the indemnitors.

In the normal course of business, we enter into repurchase
agreements and reverse repurchase agreements that settle
at a future date. In repurchase agreements, BNY Mellon
receives cash from and provides securities as collateral to a
counterparty at settlement. In reverse repurchase
agreements, BNY Mellon advances cash to and receives
securities as collateral from the counterparty at settlement.
These transactions are recorded on the consolidated
balance sheet on the settlement date. At Sept. 30, 2023, we
had no unsettled repurchase agreements and $65.9 billion
of unsettled reverse repurchase agreements. At Dec. 31,
2022, we had $4.0 billion of unsettled repurchase
agreements and $11.3 billion of unsettled reverse
repurchase agreements.

Sponsored member repo program

BNY Mellon is a sponsoring member in the FICC
sponsored member program, where we submit eligible
repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions in U.S.
Treasury and agency securities (“Sponsored Member
Transactions”) between BNY Mellon and our sponsored
member clients for novation and clearing through FICC
pursuant to the FICC Government Securities Division
rulebook (the “FICC Rules”). We also guarantee to FICC
the prompt and full payment and performance of our
sponsored member clients’ respective obligations under the
FICC Rules in connection with such clients’ Sponsored
Member Transactions. We minimize our credit exposure
under this guaranty by obtaining a security interest in our
sponsored member clients’ collateral and rights under
Sponsored Member Transactions. See “Offsetting assets
and liabilities” in Note 17 for additional information on our
repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements.

Indemnification arrangements

We have provided standard representations for
underwriting agreements, acquisition and divestiture
agreements, sales of loans and commitments, and other
similar types of arrangements and customary
indemnification for claims and legal proceedings

94 BNY Mellon

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

related to providing financial services that are not
otherwise included above. Insurance has been purchased to
mitigate certain of these risks. Generally, there are no
stated or notional amounts included in these
indemnifications, and the contingencies triggering the
obligation for indemnification are not expected to occur.
Furthermore, often counterparties to these transactions
provide us with comparable indemnifications. We are
unable to develop an estimate of the maximum payout
under these indemnifications for several reasons. In
addition to the lack of a stated or notional amount in a
majority of such indemnifications, we are unable to predict
the nature of events that would trigger indemnification or
the level of indemnification for a certain event. We believe,
however, that the possibility that we will have to make any
material payments for these indemnifications is remote. At
Sept. 30, 2023 and Dec. 31, 2022, we have not recorded
any material liabilities under these arrangements.

Clearing and settlement exchanges

We are a noncontrolling equity investor in, and/or member
of, several industry clearing or settlement exchanges
through which foreign exchange, securities, derivatives or
other transactions settle. Certain of these industry clearing
and settlement exchanges require their members to
guarantee their obligations and liabilities and/or to provide
liquidity support in the event other members do not honor
their obligations. We believe the likelihood that a clearing
or settlement exchange (of which we are a member) would
become insolvent is remote. Additionally, certain
settlement exchanges have implemented loss allocation
policies that enable the exchange to allocate settlement
losses to the members of the exchange. It is not possible to
quantify such mark-to-market loss until the loss occurs.
Any ancillary costs that occur as a result of any mark-to-
market loss cannot be quantified. In addition, we also
sponsor clients as members on clearing and settlement
exchanges and guarantee their obligations. At Sept. 30,
2023 and Dec. 31, 2022, we did not record any material
liabilities under these arrangements.

Legal proceedings

In the ordinary course of business, The Bank of New York
Mellon Corporation and its subsidiaries are routinely
named as defendants in or made parties to pending and
potential legal actions. We also are subject to governmental
and regulatory examinations,

information-gathering requests, investigations and
proceedings (both formal and informal). Claims for
significant monetary damages are often asserted in many of
these legal actions, while claims for disgorgement,
restitution, penalties and/or other remedial actions or
sanctions may be sought in governmental and regulatory
matters. It is inherently difficult to predict the eventual
outcomes of such matters given their complexity and the
particular facts and circumstances at issue in each of these
matters. However, on the basis of our current knowledge
and understanding, we do not believe that judgments,
settlements or orders, if any, arising from these matters
(either individually or in the aggregate, after giving effect
to applicable reserves and insurance coverage) will have a
material adverse effect on the consolidated financial
position or liquidity of BNY Mellon, although they could
have a material effect on our results of operations in a
given period.

In view of the inherent unpredictability of outcomes in
litigation and regulatory matters, particularly where (i) the
damages sought are substantial or indeterminate, (ii) the
proceedings are in the early stages, or (iii) the matters
involve novel legal theories or a large number of parties, as
a matter of course there is considerable uncertainty
surrounding the timing or ultimate resolution of litigation
and regulatory matters, including a possible eventual loss,
fine, penalty or business impact, if any, associated with
each such matter. In accordance with applicable accounting
guidance, we establish accruals for litigation and
regulatory matters when those matters proceed to a stage
where they present loss contingencies that are both
probable and reasonably estimable. In such cases, there
may be a possible exposure to loss in excess of any
amounts accrued. We regularly monitor such matters for
developments that could affect the amount of the accrual,
and will adjust the accrual amount as appropriate. If the
loss contingency in question is not both probable and
reasonably estimable, we do not establish an accrual and
the matter continues to be monitored for any developments
that would make the loss contingency both probable and
reasonably estimable. We believe that our accruals for legal
proceedings are appropriate and, in the aggregate, are not
material to the consolidated financial position of BNY
Mellon, although future accruals could have a material
effect on the results of operations in a given period. In
addition, if we have the potential to recover a portion of an
estimated loss from a third party, we record a

BNY Mellon 95

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

receivable up to the amount of the accrual that is probable
of recovery.

For certain of those matters described here for which a loss
contingency may, in the future, be reasonably possible
(whether in excess of a related accrued liability or where
there is no accrued liability), BNY Mellon is currently
unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss. For
those matters described here where BNY Mellon is able to
estimate a reasonably possible loss, the aggregate range of
such reasonably possible loss is up to $590 million in
excess of the accrued liability (if any) related to those
matters. For matters where a reasonably possible loss is
denominated in a foreign currency, our estimate is adjusted
quarterly based on prevailing exchange rates. We do not
consider potential recoveries when estimating reasonably
possible losses.

The following describes certain judicial, regulatory and
arbitration proceedings involving BNY Mellon:

Mortgage-Securitization Trusts Proceedings
BNY Mellon has been named as a defendant in a number
of legal actions brought by MBS investors alleging that the
trustee has expansive duties under the governing
agreements, including the duty to investigate and pursue
breach of representation and warranty claims against other
parties to the MBS transactions. Two actions commenced
in December 2015 and February 2017 are pending in New
York federal court. An action commenced in December
2014 in New York federal court was dismissed and the
dismissal was affirmed on appeal in April 2023. In New
York state court, six actions are pending: one case
commenced in May 2016; two related cases commenced in
September 2021 and October 2022; and three related cases
commenced in October 2021, December 2021 and
February 2022.

Matters Related to R. Allen Stanford
In late December 2005, Pershing LLC (“Pershing”)
became a clearing firm for Stanford Group Co. (“SGC”), a
registered broker-dealer that was part of a group of entities
ultimately controlled by R. Allen Stanford (“Stanford”).
Stanford International Bank, also controlled by Stanford,
issued certificates of deposit (“CDs”). Some investors
allegedly wired funds from their SGC accounts to purchase
CDs. In 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission
charged Stanford with operating a Ponzi scheme in
connection with the sale of CDs, and SGC was placed into
receivership. Alleged purchasers of CDs have

96 BNY Mellon

filed two putative class action proceedings against
Pershing: one in November 2009 in Texas federal court,
and one in May 2016 in New Jersey federal court. On Nov.
5, 2021, the court dismissed the class action filed in New
Jersey and that matter has concluded. Three lawsuits
remain against Pershing in Louisiana and New Jersey
federal courts, which were filed in January 2010, October
2015 and May 2016. The purchasers allege that Pershing,
as SGC’s clearing firm, assisted Stanford in a fraudulent
scheme and assert contractual, statutory and common law
claims. In March 2019, a group of investors filed a putative
class action against The Bank of New York Mellon in New
Jersey federal court, making the same allegations as in the
prior actions brought against Pershing. On Nov. 12, 2021,
the court dismissed the class action against The Bank of
New York Mellon; on Dec. 15, 2022, an appeals court
reversed the dismissal and returned the case to the trial
court for further proceedings. All the cases that have been
brought in federal court against Pershing have been
consolidated in Texas federal court for discovery purposes.
Various alleged Stanford CD purchasers asserted similar
claims in Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.
(“FINRA”) arbitration proceedings.

Brazilian Postalis Litigation
BNY Mellon Servicos Financeiros DTVM S.A.
(“DTVM”), a subsidiary that provides asset services in
Brazil, acts as administrator for certain investment funds in
which a public pension fund for postal workers called
Postalis-Instituto de Seguridade Social dos Correios e
Telégrafos (“Postalis”) invested. On Aug. 22, 2014,
Postalis sued DTVM in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil for losses
related to a Postalis fund for which DTVM is
administrator. Postalis alleges that DTVM failed to
properly perform duties, including to conduct due diligence
of and exert control over the manager. On March 12, 2015,
Postalis filed a lawsuit in Rio de Janeiro against DTVM
and BNY Mellon Administração de Ativos Ltda. (“Ativos”)
alleging failure to properly perform duties relating to
another fund of which DTVM is administrator and Ativos
is manager. On Dec. 14, 2015, Associacão dos
Profissionais dos Correios (“ADCAP”), a Brazilian postal
workers association, filed a lawsuit in São Paulo against
DTVM and other defendants alleging that DTVM
improperly contributed to Postalis investment losses. On
March 20, 2017, the lawsuit was dismissed without
prejudice, and ADCAP appealed. On Aug. 4, 2021, the
appellate court overturned the dismissal and sent the
lawsuit to a

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

state lower court. On March 2, 2023, DTVM appealed the
August 4 decision to Brazil’s Superior Court of Justice. On
Dec. 17, 2015, Postalis filed three lawsuits in Rio de
Janeiro against DTVM and Ativos alleging failure to
properly perform duties with respect to investments in
several other funds. On May 20, 2021, the court in one of
those lawsuits entered a judgment of approximately $3
million against DTVM and Ativos. On Aug. 23, 2021,
DTVM and Ativos filed an appeal of the May 20 decision.
On June 7, 2022, the appellate court partially granted and
partially denied the appeal, reducing the judgment to
approximately $2 million. On July 13, 2023, DTVM and
Ativos filed a further appeal to Brazil’s Superior Court of
Justice. On Aug. 24, 2022, the court dismissed one of the
other lawsuits. On Nov. 24, 2022, Postalis appealed that
decision. On Feb. 4, 2016, Postalis filed a lawsuit in
Brasilia against DTVM, Ativos and BNY Mellon Alocação
de Patrimônio Ltda. (“Alocação de Patrimônio”), an
investment management subsidiary, alleging failure to
properly perform duties and liability for losses with respect
to investments in various funds of which the defendants
were administrator and/or manager. On Jan. 16, 2018, the
Brazilian Federal Prosecution Service (“MPF”) filed a civil
lawsuit in São Paulo against DTVM alleging liability for
Postalis losses based on alleged failures to properly
perform certain duties as administrator to certain funds in
which Postalis invested or as controller of Postalis’s own
investment portfolio. On April 18, 2018, the court
dismissed the lawsuit without prejudice. On Aug. 4, 2021,
the appellate court overturned the dismissal and returned
the lawsuit to the lower court. On April 11, 2022, DTVM
appealed the Aug. 4 decision to Brazil’s Superior Court of
Justice. On Aug. 21, 2023, DTVM’s appeal was denied. In
addition, the Tribunal de Contas da União (“TCU”), an
administrative tribunal, has initiated proceedings with the
purpose of determining liability for losses to three
investment funds administered by DTVM in which Postalis
was an investor. On Sept. 9, 2020, TCU rendered a
decision in one of the proceedings, finding DTVM and two
former Postalis directors jointly and severally liable for
approximately $50 million. TCU also imposed on DTVM a
fine of approximately $2 million. DTVM’s administrative
appeal of the decision was denied. On Feb. 25, 2022,
DTVM filed a lawsuit in Brazil federal court in Brasilia
seeking annulment of TCU’s decision and an injunction
preventing TCU from enforcing the judgment. On Aug. 24,
2022, the Brazilian Federal Attorneys filed

an action in Rio de Janeiro court seeking to enforce the
fine portion of the judgment. On Nov. 8, 2022, the Brasilia
federal court in the annulment action granted DTVM’s
request for an injunction, suspending the Sept. 9, 2020
TCU decision until the annulment action is decided. On
Oct. 4, 2019, Postalis and another pension fund filed a
request for arbitration in São Paulo against DTVM and
Ativos alleging liability for losses to an investment fund
for which DTVM was administrator and Ativos was
manager. On March 26, 2021, DTVM and Ativos filed a
lawsuit in São Paulo challenging the decision rendered by
the Arbitration Court with respect to its jurisdiction over
the case. On Feb. 24, 2023, the São Paulo court annulled
the Arbitration Court’s decision that it had jurisdiction, and
Postalis and the other pension fund have appealed. On
Sept. 21, 2023, the São Paulo court issued an order
suspending the arbitration; the Arbitration Court
implemented the suspension on Oct. 6, 2023. On Oct. 25,
2019, Postalis filed a lawsuit in Rio de Janeiro against
DTVM and Alocação de Patrimônio, alleging liability for
losses in another fund for which DTVM was administrator
and Alocação de Patrimônio and Ativos were managers.
On May 9, 2022, the court found DTVM and Alocação de
Patrimônio jointly and severally liable for approximately
$20 million. On Aug. 12, 2022, DTVM and Alocação de
Patrimônio appealed the decision. On June 19, 2020, a
lawsuit was filed in federal court in Rio de Janeiro against
DTVM, Postalis, and various other defendants alleging
liability against DTVM for certain Postalis losses in an
investment fund of which DTVM was administrator. On
Feb. 10, 2021, Postalis and another pension fund served
DTVM in a lawsuit filed in Rio de Janeiro, alleging
liability for losses in another investment fund for which
DTVM was administrator and the other defendant was
manager.

Brazilian Silverado Litigation
DTVM acts as administrator for the Fundo de Investimento
em Direitos Creditórios Multisetorial Silverado Maximum
(“Silverado Maximum Fund”), which invests in
commercial credit receivables. On June 2, 2016, the
Silverado Maximum Fund sued DTVM in its capacity as
administrator, along with Deutsche Bank S.A. - Banco
Alemão in its capacity as custodian and Silverado Gestão e
Investimentos Ltda. in its capacity as investment manager.
The Fund alleges that each of the defendants failed to
fulfill its respective duty, and caused losses to the Fund for
which the defendants are jointly and severally liable.

German Tax Matters
German authorities are investigating past “cum/ex”
trading, which involved the purchase of equity securities
on or shortly before the dividend date, but settled after that
date, potentially resulting in an unwarranted refund of
withholding tax. German authorities have taken the view
that past cum/ex trading may have resulted in tax
avoidance or evasion. European subsidiaries of BNY
Mellon have been informed by German authorities about
investigations into potential cum/ex trading by certain
third-party investment funds, where one of the subsidiaries
had acquired entities that served as depositary and/or fund
manager for those third-party investment funds. We have
received information requests from the authorities relating
to pre-acquisition activity and are cooperating fully with
those requests. In August 2019, the District Court of Bonn
ordered that one of these subsidiaries be joined as a
secondary party in connection with the prosecution of
unrelated individual defendants. Trial commenced in
September 2019. In March 2020, the court stated that it
would refrain from taking action against the subsidiary in
order to expedite the conclusion of the trial. The court
convicted the unrelated individual defendants, and
determined that the cum/ex trading activities of the
relevant third-party investment funds were unlawful. In
November and December 2020 and February 2023, we
received secondary liability notices from the German tax
authorities totaling approximately $150 million (at then-
prevailing exchange rates) related to pre-acquisition
activity in various funds for which the entities we acquired
were depositary and/or fund manager. We have appealed
the notices. In connection with the acquisition of the
subject entities, we obtained an indemnity for liabilities
from the sellers that we intend to pursue as necessary.

Off-Channel Business-Related Communications
The Company has been responding to a request for
information from the SEC concerning compliance with
recordkeeping obligations relating to business
communications transmitted on unapproved electronic
communication platforms. SEC Staff has stated that it is
conducting similar inquiries into recordkeeping practices at
other financial institutions. The Company is cooperating
with the inquiry. In April 2023, the Company received a
similar request from the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission and is cooperating with that inquiry as well.

Note 19–Business segments

We have an internal information system that produces
performance data along product and service lines for our
three principal business segments and the Other segment.
The primary products and services and types of revenue for
our principal businesses and a description of the Other
segment are presented in Note 24 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2022 Annual
Report.

Business accounting principles

Our business data has been determined on an internal
management basis of accounting, rather than GAAP which
is used for consolidated financial reporting. These
measurement principles are designed so that reported
results of the businesses will track their economic
performance.

Business segment results are subject to reclassification
when organizational changes are made, or for refinements
in revenue and expense allocation methodologies.
Refinements are typically reflected on a prospective basis.
There were no reclassifications or organization changes in
the third quarter of 2023.

The accounting policies of the businesses are the same as
those described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements in our 2022 Annual Report.

The results of our business segments are presented and
analyzed on an internal management reporting basis.

• Revenue amounts reflect fee and other revenue

generated by each business and include revenue for
services provided between the segments that are also
provided to third parties. Fee and other revenue
transferred between businesses under revenue transfer
agreements is included within other fees in each
segment.

• Revenues and expenses associated with specific client
bases are included in those businesses. For example,
foreign exchange activity associated with clients using
custody products is included in the Securities Services
segment.

• Net interest revenue is allocated to businesses based on
the yields on the assets and liabilities generated by each
business. We employ a funds

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

•

•

•

transfer pricing system that matches funds with the
specific assets and liabilities of each business based on
their interest sensitivity and maturity characteristics.

The provision for credit losses associated with the
respective credit portfolios is reflected in each segment.

Incentives expense related to restricted stock and RSUs
is allocated to the segments.

Support and other indirect expenses, including services
provided between segments that are not provided to
third parties or not subject to a revenue transfer
agreement, are allocated to the businesses based on
internally developed methodologies and reflected in
noninterest expense.

• Recurring FDIC expense is allocated to the businesses
based on average deposits generated within each
business.

•

Severance expense is recorded in the segments based on
the business or function the impacted employees reside,
with severance related to

corporate staff, technology and operations reflected in
the Other segment.

•

Litigation expense is generally recorded in the business
in which the charge occurs.

• Management of the securities portfolio is a shared

service contained in the Other segment. As a result,
gains and losses associated with the valuation of the
securities portfolio are generally included in the Other
segment.

• Client deposits serve as the primary funding source for

our securities portfolio. We typically allocate all interest
revenue to the businesses generating the deposits.
Accordingly, accretion related to the portion of the
securities portfolio restructured in 2009 has been
included in the results of the businesses.

• Balance sheet assets and liabilities and their related
income or expense are specifically assigned to each
business. Segments with a net liability position have
been allocated assets.

• Goodwill and intangible assets are reflected within

individual businesses.

The following consolidating schedules present the contribution of our segments to our overall profitability.
