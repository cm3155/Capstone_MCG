the quarterly cash dividend on our common stock, from
$0.42 to $0.47 per share. The increased quarterly cash
dividend was paid on Aug. 2, 2024.

items. Notable items in the second quarter of 2024 include
a reduction in the FDIC special assessment, severance
expense and litigation reserves. Excluding notable items,

million (Non-GAAP), or $1.51 (Non-GAAP) per diluted
common share, in the second quarter of 2024. Net income
applicable to common shareholders was $1,036 million, or
$1.31 per diluted common share, in the second quarter of
2023, including the impact of

notable items. Notable items in the second quarter of 2023
include litigation reserves, severance expense and disposal
losses. Excluding notable items, net income applicable to

The highlights below are based on the second quarter of
2024 compared with the second quarter of 2023, unless
otherwise noted.
• Total revenue increased 2%, primarily reflecting:

• Fee revenue increased 4%, primarily reflecting
higher market values, net new business, higher
foreign exchange revenue and higher client activity,
partially offset by the mix of AUM flows. (See “Fee
and other revenue” beginning on page 6.)

•

Investment and other revenue increased primarily
reflecting higher client activity in our fixed income
and equity trading business. (See “Fee and other
revenue” beginning on page 6.)

• Net interest income decreased 6%, primarily

reflecting changes in balance sheet mix, partially
offset by higher interest rates. (See “Net interest
income” on page 9.)

• Noninterest expense decreased 1%, primarily reflecting
efficiency savings, a reduction in the FDIC special
assessment and lower litigation reserves, partially offset
by higher investments, employee merit increases and
higher revenue-related expenses. Excluding notable
items, noninterest expense increased 1% (Non-GAAP).
(See “Noninterest expense” on page 12.)

• Effective tax rate of 23.4%. (See “Income taxes” on

page 12.)

See “Supplemental information – Explanation of GAAP
and Non-GAAP financial measures” beginning on page 43
for a reconciliation of these Non-GAAP measures.

Metrics

• AUC/A of $49.5 trillion increased 6%, primarily

reflecting higher market values.

higher market values.

Capital and liquidity

• Our CET1 ratio was 11.4% at June 30, 2024 and 10.8%
at March 31, 2024 under the Standardized Approach.
The increase reflects an increase in capital and lower
risk-weighted assets. (See “Capital” beginning on page
36.)

• Tier 1 leverage was 5.8% at June 30, 2024 and 5.9% at
March 31, 2024. The decrease reflects higher average
assets, partially offset by the increase in capital. (See
“Capital” beginning on page 36.)

• Returned $923 million to common shareholders,

including $601 million of common share repurchases.

N/M – Not meaningful.

Fee revenue increased 4% compared with the second
quarter of 2023 and 3% compared with the first quarter of
2024. The increase compared with the second quarter of
2023 primarily reflects higher investment services fees and
foreign exchange revenue. The increase compared with the
first quarter of 2024 primarily reflects higher investment
services fees and foreign exchange revenue, partially offset
by lower investment management and performance fees.

Investment and other revenue increased $22 million
compared with the second quarter of 2023 and decreased
$13 million compared with the first quarter of 2024. The
increase compared with the second quarter of 2023
primarily reflects higher client activity in our fixed income
and equity trading business. The decrease compared with
the first quarter of 2024 primarily reflects net securities
losses.

Investment services fees

Investment services fees increased 5% compared with the
second quarter of 2023 and 4% compared with the first
quarter of 2024. The increase compared with the second
quarter of 2023 primarily reflects higher market values, net
new business and higher client

6 BNY

activity, partially offset by lower Depositary Receipts
revenue. The increase compared with the first quarter of
2024 primarily reflects higher Depositary Receipts revenue
and net new business.

AUC/A totaled $49.5 trillion at June 30, 2024, an increase
of 6% compared with June 30, 2023, primarily reflecting
higher market values. AUC/A consisted of 37% equity
securities and 63% fixed income securities at June 30,
2024, and 34% equity securities and 66% fixed income
securities at June 30, 2023.

See “Securities Services business segment” and “Market
and Wealth Services business segment” in “Review of
business segments” for additional details.

Investment management and performance fees

Investment management and performance fees were flat
compared with the second quarter of 2023 and decreased
2% compared with the first quarter of 2024. Compared
with the second quarter of 2023 higher market values were
offset by the mix of AUM flows, lower equity investment
income and changes in product mix. The decrease
compared with the first quarter of 2024 primarily reflects
the mix of AUM

flows and lower equity investment income, partially offset
by higher market values. Performance fees were $8 million
in the second quarter of 2024, $10 million in the second
quarter of 2023 and $10 million in the first quarter of 2024.
On a constant currency basis (Non-GAAP), investment
management and performance fees were flat compared
with the second quarter of 2023. See “Supplemental
information – Explanation of GAAP and Non-GAAP
financial measures” beginning on page 43 for the
reconciliation of Non-GAAP measures.

AUM was $2.0 trillion at June 30, 2024, an increase of 7%
compared with June 30, 2023, primarily reflecting higher
market values.

See “Investment and Wealth Management business
segment” in “Review of business segments” for additional
details regarding the drivers of investment management
and performance fees, AUM and AUM flows.

Foreign exchange revenue

Foreign exchange revenue is primarily driven by the
volume of client transactions and the spread realized on
these transactions, both of which are impacted by market
volatility, the impact of foreign currency hedging activities
and foreign currency remeasurement gain (loss). Foreign
exchange revenue increased 16% compared with the
second quarter of 2023 and 21% compared with the first
quarter of 2024. Both increases were primarily driven by
higher volumes. Foreign exchange revenue is primarily
reported in the Securities Services business segment and,
to a lesser extent, in the Market and Wealth Services and
Investment and Wealth Management business segments
and the Other segment.

Financing-related fees

Financing-related fees, which are primarily reported in the
Market and Wealth Services and Securities Services
business segments, include capital market fees, loan
commitment fees and credit-related fees. Financing-related
fees increased 6% compared with the second quarter of
2023 and decreased 7% compared with the first quarter of
2024. The increase compared with the second quarter of
2023 primarily reflects higher underwriting fees. The
decrease compared with the first quarter of 2024 primarily
reflects lower underwriting fees, partially offset by higher
loan commitment fees.

Investment and other revenue

Investment and other revenue includes income or loss from
consolidated investment management funds, seed capital
gains or losses, other trading revenue or loss, renewable
energy investments gains, income from corporate and
bank-owned life insurance contracts, other investment
gains or losses, gains or losses from disposals, expense
reimbursements from our CIBC Mellon joint venture, other
income or loss and net securities gains or losses. The
income or loss from consolidated investment management
funds should be considered together with the net income or
loss attributable to noncontrolling interests, which reflects
the portion of the consolidated funds for which we do not
have an economic interest and is reflected below net
income as a separate line item on the consolidated income
statement. Other trading revenue or loss primarily includes
the impact of market-risk hedging activity related to our
seed capital investments in investment management funds,
non-foreign currency derivative and fixed income trading,
and other hedging activity. Other investment gains or
losses includes fair value changes of non-readily
marketable strategic equity, private equity and other
investments. Expense reimbursements from our CIBC
Mellon joint venture relate to expenses incurred by BNY
on behalf of the CIBC Mellon joint venture. Other income
includes various miscellaneous revenues.

equity trading business. The decrease compared with the
first quarter of 2024 primarily reflects net securities losses.

Year-to-date 2024 compared with year-to-date 2023

Fee revenue increased 5% compared with the first six
months of 2023, primarily reflecting higher investment
services fees. The 6% increase in investment services fees
primarily reflects higher market values, net new business
and higher client activity. Investment management and
performance fees were flat, reflecting higher market
values, offset by the mix of AUM flows, lower
performance fees and changes in product mix. The 1%
increase in foreign exchange revenue primarily reflects
higher volumes, partially offset by lower volatility.

Investment and other revenue increased $73 million
compared with the first six months of 2023, primarily
reflecting higher client activity in our fixed income and
equity trading business and equity investment gains.

N/M – Not meaningful.
bps – basis points.

Net interest income decreased 6% compared with the
second quarter of 2023 and 1% compared with the first
quarter of 2024. The decrease compared with the second
quarter of 2023 primarily reflects changes in balance sheet
mix, partially offset by higher interest rates. The decrease
compared with the first quarter of 2024 primarily reflects
changes in balance sheet mix, partially offset by the benefit
of reinvesting maturing fixed-rate securities in higher
yielding alternatives.

Net interest margin decreased 5 basis points compared with
the second quarter of 2023 and 4 basis points compared
with the first quarter of 2024. The changes compared with
the second quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024
primarily reflect the factors mentioned above.

Average interest-earning assets decreased 2% compared
with the second quarter of 2023 and increased 2%
compared with the first quarter of 2024. The decrease
compared with the second quarter of 2023 primarily
reflects lower interest-bearing deposits with the Federal
Reserve and other central banks and interest-bearing
deposits with banks, partially offset by higher loan
balances and Federal funds sold and securities purchased
under resale agreements. The increase compared with the
first quarter of 2024 primarily reflects higher securities and
loan balances and federal funds sold and securities
purchased under resale agreements.

Average non-U.S. dollar deposits comprised approximately
25% of our average total deposits in the second quarter of
2024. Approximately 50% of the average non-U.S. dollar
deposits in the second quarter of 2024 were euro-
denominated.

Year-to-date 2024 compared with year-to-date 2023

Net interest income decreased 7% compared with the first
six months of 2023, primarily driven by changes in balance
sheet mix, partially offset by higher interest rates. The
decrease in the net interest margin primarily reflects the
factors mentioned above.

Average interest-earning assets decreased 2% compared
with the first six months of 2023, primarily reflecting
lower securities balances and interest-bearing deposits with
banks, partially offset by higher loan balances.

quarter of 2024 and $113 billion for the second quarter of 2023. On a Non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of offsetting, the yield on federal funds sold and securities
purchased under resale agreements would have been 5.51% for the second quarter of 2024, 5.49% for the first quarter of 2024 and 5.10% for the second quarter of 2023.

On a Non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of offsetting, the rate on federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements would have been 5.41%

for the second quarter of 2024, 5.38% for the first quarter of 2024 and 4.99% for the second quarter of 2023. We believe providing the rates excluding the impact of

netting is useful to investors as it is more reflective of the actual rates earned and paid.

On Jan. 1, 2024, we adopted ASU 2023-02, Investments—
Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting
for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the
Proportional Amortization Method, on a retrospective
basis. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information on the new
accounting guidance.

the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Business segment accounting principles

Our business segment data has been determined on an
internal management basis of accounting, rather than the
generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) used
for consolidated financial reporting. These measurement
principles are designed so that reported results of the
businesses will track their economic performance.

For information on the accounting principles of our
business segments, see Note 19 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. For information on the
primary products and services in each line of business, the
primary types of revenue by line of business and how our
business segments are presented and analyzed, see Note 24
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our
2023 Annual Report.

Business segment results are subject to reclassification
when organizational changes are made, or for refinements
in revenue and expense allocation methodologies.
Refinements are typically reflected on a prospective basis.
There were no reclassifications or organizational changes
in the second quarter of 2024. In the first quarter of 2024,
we made certain realignments of similar products and
services within our lines of business consistent with the
firm’s ongoing transition to a platforms operating model
uniting related capabilities and enabling streamlining of
internal processes to drive growth, efficiency, resiliency,
and enhanced risk management. The largest change was
the movement of Institutional Solutions from Pershing to
Clearance and Collateral Management, both in the Market
and Wealth Services business segment. We made other
smaller changes that moved activity from Asset Servicing
in the Securities Services business segment to Treasury
Services in the Market and Wealth Services business
segment, and from Wealth Management in the Investment
and Wealth Management business segment and Pershing in
the Market and Wealth Services business segment to
Investment Management in the Investment and Wealth
Management business segment. The Other segment was
not impacted by the changes. Business segment results for
the three- and six- months ended June 30, 2023 have been
revised to reflect these changes.

The results of our business segments may be influenced by
client and other activities that vary by

Securities Services business segment

quarter. In the first quarter, staff expense typically
increases, reflecting the vesting of long-term stock awards
for retirement-eligible employees. The timing of our
annual employee merit increases also impacts staff
expense. In 2024, the merit increase was effective in
March, thus partially impacting the first quarter and second
quarter staff expense variances. For 2023, the merit
increase was effective at the beginning of the second
quarter. In the third quarter, volume-related fees may
decline due to reduced client activity. In the fourth quarter,
we typically incur higher business development and
marketing expenses. In our Investment and Wealth
Management business segment, performance fees are
typically higher in the fourth and first quarters, as those
quarters represent the end of the measurement period for
many of the performance fee-eligible relationships.

The results of our business segments may also be impacted
by the translation of financial results denominated in
foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar. We are primarily
impacted by activities denominated in the British pound
and the euro. On a consolidated basis and in our Securities
Services and Market and Wealth Services business
segments, we typically have more foreign currency-
denominated expenses than revenues. However, our
Investment and Wealth Management business segment
typically has more foreign currency-denominated revenues
than expenses. Overall, currency fluctuations impact the
year-over-year growth rate in the Investment and Wealth
Management business segment more than the Securities
Services and Market and Wealth Services business
segments. However, currency fluctuations, in isolation, are
not expected to significantly impact net income on a
consolidated basis.

Fee revenue in the Investment and Wealth Management
business segment, and, to a lesser extent, the Securities
Services and Market and Wealth Services business
segments, is impacted by global market fluctuations. At
June 30, 2024, we estimated that a 5% change in global
equity markets, spread evenly throughout the year, would
impact fee revenue by less than 1% and diluted earnings
per common share by $0.04 to $0.07.

See Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for the consolidating schedules, which show the
contribution of our business segments to our overall
profitability.

Review of financial results

AUC/A of $35.7 trillion increased 8% compared with
June 30, 2023, primarily reflecting higher market values
and net client flows.

Total revenue of $2.2 billion was flat compared with the
second quarter of 2023 and increased 5% compared with
the first quarter of 2024. The drivers of total revenue by
line of business are indicated below.

Asset Servicing revenue of $1.7 billion was flat
compared with the second quarter of 2023 and increased
1% compared with the first quarter of 2024. Compared
with the second quarter of 2023, higher market values,
net new business and higher foreign exchange revenue
were offset by lower net interest income. The increase
compared with the first quarter of 2024 primarily reflects
higher foreign exchange revenue and net new business.

Issuer Services revenue of $552 million increased 3%
compared with the second quarter of 2023 and 17%
compared with the first quarter of 2024. The increase
compared with the second quarter of 2023 primarily
reflects higher Corporate Trust fees and net interest
income, partially offset by lower Depository Receipts
revenue. The increase compared with the first quarter of
2024 primarily reflects higher Depository Receipts
revenue, net interest income and Corporate Trust fees.

Market and regulatory trends are driving investable
assets toward lower fee asset management products at
reduced margins for our clients. These dynamics are also
negatively impacting our investment services fees.
However, at the same time, these trends are providing
additional outsourcing opportunities as clients and other
market participants seek to comply with regulations and
reduce their operating costs.

Noninterest expense of $1.6 billion decreased 1%
compared with the second quarter of 2023 and

BNY 15

increased 1% compared with the first quarter of 2024.
The decrease compared with the second quarter of 2023
primarily reflects efficiency savings, partially offset by
higher investments, employee merit increases and higher
revenue-related expenses. The increase compared with
first quarter of 2024 primarily reflects higher revenue-
related expenses and employee merit increases, partially
offset by efficiency savings.

Year-to-date 2024 compared with year-to-date 2023

Total revenue of $4.4 billion increased 1% compared with
the first six months of 2023. Asset Servicing revenue of
$3.4 billion was flat compared with the first six months of
2023, primarily reflecting higher market values, net new
business and higher client activity in our fixed income and
trading business, offset by lower net interest income. Issuer
Services revenue of $1.0 billion increased 4%, primarily
reflecting higher Corporate Trust fees and net interest
income.

Noninterest expense of $3.1 billion decreased 1%
compared with the first six months of 2023, primarily
reflecting efficiency savings, partially offset by higher
investments and employee merit increases.

Business segment description

The Market and Wealth Services business segment consists
of three distinct lines of business, Pershing, Treasury
Services and Clearance and Collateral Management, which
provide business services and technology solutions to
entities including financial institutions, corporations,
foundations and endowments, public funds and
government agencies. For information on the drivers of the
Market and Wealth Services fee revenue, see Note 10 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2023
Annual Report.

Pershing provides execution, clearing, custody, business
and technology solutions, delivering operational support to
broker-dealers, wealth managers and registered investment
advisors (“RIAs”) globally.

Our Treasury Services business is a leading provider of
global payments, liquidity management and trade finance
services for financial institutions, corporations and the
public sector.

Our Clearance and Collateral Management business
clears and settles equity and fixed income transactions
globally and serves as custodian for tri-party repo
collateral worldwide. We are the primary provider of
U.S. government securities clearance and a provider of
non-U.S. government securities clearance. Our collateral
services include collateral management, administration
and segregation. We offer innovative solutions and
industry expertise, which help financial institutions and
institutional investors with their financing, risk and
balance sheet challenges. We are a leading provider of
tri-party collateral management services with an average
of $5.3 trillion serviced globally, including
approximately $4.1 trillion of the U.S. tri-party repo
market at June 30, 2024.

Review of financial results

AUC/A of $13.4 trillion was flat compared with June 30,
2023, primarily reflecting higher market values offset by
lower collateral management balances.

Total revenue of $1.5 billion increased 6% compared with
the second quarter of 2023 and 1% compared with the first
quarter of 2024. The drivers of total revenue by line of
business are indicated below.

Pershing revenue of $663 million increased 3% compared
with the second quarter of 2023 and

18 BNY

decreased 1% compared with the first quarter of 2024. The
increase compared with the second quarter of 2023
primarily reflects higher market values and client activity,
partially offset by lost business in the prior year. The
decrease compared with the first quarter of 2024 primarily
reflects lower net interest income and lost business in the
prior year, partially offset by an equity investment gain.
Net new assets were $(23) billion in the second quarter of
2024, reflecting the ongoing deconversion of business lost
in the prior year.

Treasury Services revenue of $426 million increased 3%
compared with the second quarter of 2023 and 2%
compared with the first quarter of 2024. Both increases
primarily reflect net new business and higher client
activity, partially offset by lower net interest income.

Clearance and Collateral Management revenue of $446
million increased 12% compared with the second quarter
of 2023 and 3% compared with the first quarter of 2024.
Both increases primarily reflect higher collateral
management fees and clearance volumes.

Noninterest expense of $833 million increased 5%
compared with the second quarter of 2023 and was flat
compared with the first quarter of 2024. The increase
compared with the second quarter of 2023 primarily
reflects higher investments, employee merit increases and
higher revenue-related expenses, partially offset by
efficiency savings.

Year-to-date 2024 compared with year-to-date 2023

Total revenue of $3.1 billion increased 4% compared with
the first six months of 2023. Pershing revenue of $1.3
billion increased 3%, primarily reflecting higher market
values and client activity, partially offset by lost business
in the prior year. Treasury Services revenue of $842
million increased 1%, primarily reflecting net new business
and higher client activity, partially offset by lower net
interest income. Clearance and Collateral Management
revenue of $877 million increased 9%, primarily reflecting
higher collateral management fees and clearance volumes.

Noninterest expense of $1.7 billion increased 6%
compared with the first six months of 2023, primarily
reflecting higher investments, employee merit increases
and higher revenue-related expenses, partially offset by
efficiency savings.

Business segment description

Review of financial results

Our Investment and Wealth Management business segment
consists of two distinct lines of business: Investment
Management and Wealth Management. Our investment
firms deliver a highly diversified portfolio of investment
strategies independently, and through our global
distribution network, to institutional and retail clients
globally. Wealth Management provides investment
management, custody, wealth and estate planning, private
banking services, investment servicing and information
management. See pages 18 and 19 of our 2023 Annual
Report for additional information on our Investment and
Wealth Management business segment.

AUM of $2.0 trillion as of June 30, 2024, increased 7%
compared with June 30, 2023, primarily reflecting higher
market values.

Net long-term strategy outflows were $2 billion in the
second quarter of 2024, driven by equity, index and multi-
asset and alternative investments, partially offset by
inflows of liability-driven and fixed income investments.
Short-term strategy outflows were $7 billion in the second
quarter of 2024. Market and regulatory trends have
resulted in increased demand for lower fee asset
management products and for performance-based fees.

Total revenue of $821 million increased 1% compared with
the second quarter of 2023 and decreased 3% compared
with the first quarter of 2024. The drivers of total revenue
by line of business are indicated below.

20 BNY

Investment Management revenue of $549 million
decreased 1% compared with the second quarter of 2023
and 5% compared with the first quarter of 2024. The
decrease compared with the second quarter of 2023
primarily reflects the mix of AUM flows and lower equity
investment income and seed capital gains, partially offset
by higher market values. The decrease compared with the
first quarter of 2024 primarily reflects the mix of AUM
flows and lower seed capital gains and equity investment
income, partially offset by higher market values.

Wealth Management revenue of $272 million increased 3%
compared with the second quarter of 2023 and 1%
compared with the first quarter of 2024. Both increases
primarily reflect higher market values, partially offset by
changes in product mix.

Revenue generated in the Investment and Wealth
Management business segment included 30% from non-
U.S. sources in the second quarter of 2024, second quarter
of 2023 and first quarter of 2024.

Noninterest expense of $668 million decreased 2%
compared with the second quarter of 2023 and 10%

Other segment

compared with the first quarter of 2024. The decrease
compared with the second quarter of 2023 primarily
reflects efficiency savings and lower revenue-related
expenses, partially offset by employee merit increases and
higher investments. The decrease compared with the first
quarter of 2024 primarily reflects lower revenue-related
expenses.

Year-to-date 2024 compared with year-to-date 2023

Total revenue of $1.7 billion increased 1% compared with
the first six months of 2023. Investment Management
revenue of $1.1 billion increased 1%, primarily reflecting
higher market values, partially offset by the mix of AUM
flows and lower performance fees. Wealth Management
revenue of $542 million increased 2%, primarily reflecting
higher market values, partially offset by changes in product
mix.

Noninterest expense of $1.4 billion decreased 1%
compared with the first six months of 2023, primarily
reflecting efficiency savings and lower revenue-related
expenses, partially offset by higher investments and
employee merit increases.

Review of financial results

Total revenue includes corporate treasury and other
investment activity, including hedging activity, which has
an offsetting impact between fee and other revenue and net
interest expense.

Total revenue decreased $5 million compared with the
second quarter of 2023 and $23 million compared with the
first quarter of 2024. The decrease compared with the first
quarter of 2024 primarily reflects net securities losses in
the second quarter of 2024.

Noninterest expense decreased $56 million compared with
the second quarter of 2023 and $50 million compared with
the first quarter of 2024. The

BNY 21

decrease compared with the second quarter of 2023
primarily reflects a reduction in the FDIC special
assessment and lower litigation reserves. The decrease
compared with the first quarter of 2024 primarily reflects a
reduction in the FDIC special assessment.

Year-to-date 2024 compared with year-to-date 2023

Loss before income taxes decreased $34 million compared
with the first six months of 2023. Total fee and other
revenue decreased $18 million, primarily reflecting the net
securities losses in the second quarter of 2024.

Noninterest expense decreased $32 million compared with
the first six months of 2023, primarily reflecting a
reduction in the FDIC special assessment and lower
litigation reserves, partially offset by higher severance
expense.

Critical accounting estimates

Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our
2023 Annual Report. Our critical accounting estimates are
those related to the allowance for credit losses, goodwill
and other intangibles and litigation and regulatory
contingencies, as referenced below.

Critical accounting estimates Reference

Allowance for credit losses

2023 Annual Report, pages 23-24, and
“Allowance for credit losses.”

Goodwill and other
intangibles

2023 Annual Report, pages 24-25.
Also see below.

Litigation and regulatory
contingencies

“Legal proceedings” in Note 18 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Goodwill and other intangibles

BNY’s business segments include seven reporting units for
which goodwill impairment testing is performed on an
annual basis. An interim goodwill impairment test is
performed when events or circumstances occur that may
indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of
any reporting unit may be less than its carrying value.

22 BNY

In the second quarter of 2024, due to the results of the first
quarter 2024 interim and annual goodwill impairment test
and macroeconomic conditions, we performed an interim
goodwill impairment test of the Investment Management
reporting unit, which had $6.1 billion of allocated
goodwill. The fair value of the Investment Management
reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by
approximately 3%. We determined the fair value of the
Investment Management reporting unit using an income
approach based on management’s projections as of June
30, 2024. The discount rate applied to these cash flows was
10.5%.

As of June 30, 2024, if the discount rate applied to the
estimated cash flows was increased or decreased by 25
basis points, the fair value of the Investment Management
reporting unit would decrease or increase by 4%,
respectively. Similarly, if the long-term growth rate was
increased or decreased by 10 basis points, the fair value of
the Investment Management reporting unit would increase
or decrease by approximately 1%, respectively.

In the second quarter of 2024, we also performed our
annual goodwill impairment test on the remaining six
reporting units using an income approach to estimate fair
values of each reporting unit. Estimated cash flows used in
the income approach were based on management’s
projections as of April 1, 2024. The discount rate applied to
these cash flows was 10%.

As a result of the annual goodwill impairment test, no
goodwill impairment was recognized. The fair values of
the Company’s remaining six reporting units were
substantially in excess of the respective reporting units’
carrying value.

Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is subject to
uncertainty as it is reliant on estimates of cash flows that
extend far into the future, and, by their nature, are difficult
to estimate over such an extended time frame. In the future,
changes in the assumptions or the discount rate could
produce a material non-cash goodwill impairment.

Consolidated balance sheet review

One of our key risk management objectives is to maintain a
balance sheet that remains strong throughout market cycles
to meet the expectations of our major stakeholders,
including our shareholders, clients, creditors and
regulators.

We also seek to undertake overall liquidity risk, including
intraday liquidity risk, that stays within our risk appetite.
The objective of our balance sheet management strategy is
to maintain a balance sheet that is characterized by strong
liquidity and asset quality, ready access to external funding
sources at competitive rates and a strong capital structure
that supports our risk-taking activities and is adequate to
absorb potential losses. In managing the balance sheet,
appropriate consideration is given to balancing the
competing needs of maintaining sufficient levels of
liquidity and complying with applicable regulations and
supervisory expectations while optimizing profitability.

At June 30, 2024, total assets were $429 billion, compared
with $410 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. The increase in total
assets was primarily driven by higher securities, interest-
bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central
banks and loans, partially offset by lower interest-bearing
deposits with banks. Deposits totaled $304 billion at June
30, 2024, compared with $284 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.
The increase reflects higher interest-bearing deposits in
U.S. offices. Total interest-bearing deposits as a percentage
of total interest-earning assets were 67% at June 30, 2024
and 66% at Dec. 31, 2023.

At June 30, 2024, available funds totaled $163 billion and
included cash and due from banks, interest-bearing
deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central banks,
interest-bearing deposits with banks and federal funds sold
and securities purchased under resale agreements. This
compares with available funds of $158 billion at Dec. 31,
2023. Total available funds as a percentage of total assets
was 38% at June 30, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023. For
additional information on our available funds, see
“Liquidity and dividends.”

Securities were $137 billion, or 32% of total assets, at June
30, 2024, compared with $126 billion, or 31% of

total assets, at Dec. 31, 2023. The increase primarily
reflects higher non-U.S. government, U.S. Treasury and
agency residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”),
partially offset by lower U.S. government agencies
securities and unrealized pre-tax losses in the first six
months of 2024. For additional information on our
securities portfolio, see “Securities” and Note 4 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Loans were $71 billion, or 16% of total assets, at June 30,
2024, compared with $67 billion, or 16% of total assets, at
Dec. 31, 2023. The increase was driven by higher loans in
the financial institutions portfolio and margin loans. For
additional information on our loan portfolio, see “Loans”
and Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Long-term debt totaled $31 billion at June 30, 2024 and
Dec. 31, 2023. Maturities, redemptions and a decrease in
the fair value of hedged long-term debt were offset by
issuances. For additional information on long-term debt,
see “Liquidity and dividends.”

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation total
shareholders’ equity totaled $41 billion at June 30, 2024
and Dec. 31, 2023. For additional information, see
“Capital.”

Country risk exposure

The following table presents BNY’s top 10 exposures by
country (excluding the U.S.) as of June 30, 2024, as well as
certain countries with higher risk profiles. The exposure is
presented on an internal risk management basis and has not
been reduced by the allowance for credit losses. We
monitor our exposure to these and other countries as part of
our internal country risk management process.

The country risk exposure below reflects the Company’s
risk to an immediate default of the counterparty or obligor
based on the country of residence of the entity which
incurs the liability. If there is credit risk mitigation, the
country of residence of the entity providing the risk
mitigation is the country of risk. The country of risk for
securities is generally based on the domicile of the issuer
of the security.

(d)    The top 10 country exposures comprise approximately 70% of our total non-U.S. exposure.
(e)    Represents cash balances with exposure to Russia.

Events in recent years have resulted in increased focus on
Brazil. The country risk exposure to Brazil is primarily
short-term trade finance loans extended to large financial
institutions. We also have operations in Brazil providing
investment services and investment management services.

The war in Ukraine increased our focus on Russia. The
country risk exposure to Russia consists of cash balances
related to our securities services businesses and may
increase in the future to the extent cash is received for the
benefit of our clients that is subject to distribution
restrictions. BNY has ceased new banking business in
Russia

and suspended investment management purchases of
Russian securities. At June 30, 2024, less than 0.1% of our
AUC/A and less than 0.01% of our AUM consisted of
Russian securities. We will continue to work with
multinational clients that depend on our custody and
recordkeeping services to manage their exposures.

We are monitoring our exposure to Israel as part of our
internal country risk management process. At June 30,
2024, our total exposure to Israel was $321 million and
primarily consisted of investment grade short-term interest-
bearing deposits and OTC derivatives maturing within six
months.

Securities

In the discussion of our securities portfolio, we have included certain credit ratings information because the information can
indicate the degree of credit risk to which we are exposed. Significant changes in ratings classifications could indicate increased
credit risk for us and could be accompanied by an increase in the allowance for credit losses and/or a reduction in the fair value
of our securities portfolio.

(g)    At June 30, 2024, includes pre-tax net unrealized losses of $1,982 million related to available-for-sale securities, net of hedges, and $5,142 million related to held-to-maturity

securities. The after-tax unrealized losses, net of hedges, related to available-for-sale securities is $1,496 million and the after-tax equivalent related to held-to-maturity securities is

$3,921 million.

The fair value of our securities portfolio, including related
hedges, was $133.9 billion at June 30, 2024, compared
with $123.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. The increase
primarily reflects higher non-U.S. government, U.S.
Treasury and agency RMBS, partially offset by lower U.S.
government agencies securities and unrealized pre-tax
losses in the first six months of 2024.

The unrealized loss (after-tax) on our available-for-sale
securities portfolio, net of hedges, included in accumulated
other comprehensive income was $1.5 billion at June 30,
2024, compared with $1.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. Net
unrealized loss, including the impact of hedges, decreased
as securities moved closer to maturity, partially offset by
the impact of higher interest rates.

At June 30, 2024, the securities portfolio had a net
unrealized loss, including the impact of related hedges, of
$7.1 billion, compared with $7.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.
The increase in the unrealized loss, including the impact of
related hedges, primarily reflects the impact of higher
interest rates, partially offset by securities moving closer to
maturity.

The fair value of the available-for-sale securities totaled
$92.6 billion at June 30, 2024, net of hedges, or 69% of the
securities portfolio, net of hedges. The fair value of the
held-to-maturity securities totaled $41.3 billion at June 30,
2024, or 31% of the securities portfolio, net of hedges.

At June 30, 2024, 98% of the securities in our portfolio
were rated AAA/AA-, compared with 99% at Dec. 31,
2023.

Our financial institutions and commercial portfolios
comprise our largest concentrated risk. These portfolios

The financial institutions portfolio exposure was $44.6
billion at June 30, 2024, an increase of 12% compared with
Dec. 31, 2023, primarily reflecting higher exposure in the
securities industry and banks portfolios.

Financial institution exposures are high quality, with 97%
of the exposures meeting the investment grade equivalent
criteria of our internal credit rating classification at June
30, 2024. Each customer is assigned an internal credit
rating, which is mapped to an equivalent external rating
agency grade based upon a number of dimensions, which
are continually evaluated and may change over time. For
ratings of non-U.S. counterparties, our internal credit rating
is generally capped at a rating equivalent to the sovereign
rating of the country where the counterparty resides,
regardless of the internal credit rating assigned to the
counterparty or the underlying collateral.

The exposure to financial institutions is generally short
term, with 84% of the exposures expiring within one year.
At June 30, 2024, 16% of the exposure to financial
institutions had an expiration within 90 days, compared
with 19% at Dec. 31, 2023.

In addition, 65% of the financial institutions exposure is
secured. For example, securities industry clients

Commercial

and asset managers often borrow against marketable
securities held in custody.

At June 30, 2024, the secured intraday credit provided to
dealers in connection with their tri-party repo activity
totaled $13.5 billion and was included in the securities
industry portfolio. Dealers secure the outstanding intraday
credit with high-quality liquid collateral having a market
value in excess of the amount of the outstanding credit.
Secured intraday credit facilities represent approximately
30% of the exposure in the financial institutions portfolio
and are reviewed and reapproved annually.

The asset managers portfolio exposure is high quality, with
95% of the exposures meeting our investment grade
equivalent ratings criteria as of June 30, 2024. These
exposures are generally short-term liquidity facilities, with
the majority to regulated mutual funds.

Our banks portfolio exposure primarily relates to global
trade finance. These exposures are short term in nature,
with 94% due in less than one year. The investment grade
percentage of our banks portfolio exposure was 89% at
June 30, 2024, compared with 84% at Dec. 31, 2023. Our
non-investment grade exposures are primarily trade finance
loans in Brazil.

Wealth management loans

Our wealth management loan exposure was $9.3 billion at
June 30, 2024, compared with $9.6 billion at Dec. 31,
2023. Wealth management loans primarily consist of loans
to high-net-worth individuals, a majority of which are
secured by the customers’ investment management
accounts or custody accounts.

Wealth management mortgages

Our wealth management mortgage exposure was $9.2
billion at June 30, 2024, compared with $9.4 billion

Commercial real estate

at Dec. 31, 2023. Wealth management mortgages primarily
consist of loans to high-net-worth individuals, which are
secured by residential property. Wealth management
mortgages are primarily interest-only, adjustable-rate
mortgages with a weighted-average loan-to-value ratio of
61% at origination. At June 30, 2024, less than 1% of the
mortgages were past due.

At June 30, 2024, the wealth management mortgage
portfolio consisted of the following geographic
concentrations: California – 21%; New York – 14%;
Florida – 11%; Massachusetts – 8%; and other – 46%.

Our commercial real estate exposure totaled $10.1 billion
at June 30, 2024 and $10.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. Our
income-producing commercial real estate facilities are
focused on experienced owners and are structured with
moderate leverage based on existing cash flows. Our
commercial real estate lending activities also include
construction and renovation facilities. Our client base
consists of experienced developers and long-term holders
of real estate assets. Loans are approved on the basis of
existing or projected cash flows and supported by
appraisals and knowledge of local market conditions.
Development loans are structured with moderate leverage
and, in many instances, involve some level of recourse to
the developer.

At June 30, 2024, the unsecured portfolio consisted of real
estate investment trusts (“REITs”) and real estate operating
companies, which are both primarily investment grade.

28 BNY

At June 30, 2024, our commercial real estate portfolio
consisted of the following concentrations: New York metro
– 34%; REITs and real estate operating companies – 29%;
and other – 37%.

Lease financings

The lease financings portfolio exposure totaled $600
million at June 30, 2024 and $599 million at Dec. 31,
2023. At June 30, 2024, nearly all of leasing exposure was
investment grade, or investment grade equivalent, and
consisted of exposures backed by well-diversified assets,
primarily real estate and large-ticket transportation
equipment. Assets are both domestic and foreign-based,
with primary concentrations in Germany and the U.S.

Other residential mortgages

Other loans

The other residential mortgages portfolio primarily consists
of 1-4 family residential mortgage loans and totaled $1.1
billion at June 30, 2024 and $1.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.

Other loans primarily include loans to consumers that are
fully collateralized with equities, mutual funds and fixed-
income securities.

Overdrafts

Margin loans

Overdrafts primarily relate to custody and securities
clearance clients and are generally repaid within two
business days.

Capital call financing

Capital call financing includes loans to private equity funds
that are secured by the fund investors’ capital commitments
and the funds’ rights to call capital.

Margin loan exposure of $19.6 billion at June 30, 2024 and
$18.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2023 was collateralized with
marketable securities. Borrowers are required to maintain a
daily collateral margin in excess of 100% of the value of
the loan. Margin loans included $9 billion at June 30, 2024
and $7 billion at Dec. 31, 2023 related to a term loan
program that offers fully collateralized loans to broker-
dealers.

Allowance for credit losses

Our credit strategy is to focus on investment grade clients who are active users of our non-credit services. Our primary exposure
to the credit risk of a customer consists of funded loans, unfunded contractual commitments to lend, standby letters of credit
and overdrafts associated with our custody and securities clearance businesses.

The following table details changes in our allowance for credit losses.

(a)    The allowance allocated to margin loans, overdrafts and other loans was insignificant at June 30, 2024, March 31, 2024, Dec. 31, 2023 and June 30,

2023.

(b)    The methodology used to allocate the qualitative reserves was modified in the second quarter of 2024 to align certain specifically identifiable

qualitative reserves with the respective class of financing receivables. For additional information, see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

The allocation of the allowance for credit losses is
inherently judgmental, and the entire allowance for credit
losses is available to absorb credit losses regardless of the
nature of the losses.

Our allowance for credit losses is sensitive to a number of
inputs, most notably the macroeconomic forecast
assumptions that are incorporated into our estimate of
credit losses through the expected life of the loan portfolio,
as well as the credit ratings assigned to each borrower. As
the macroeconomic environment and related forecasts
change, the allowance for credit losses may change
materially. The following sensitivity analyses do not
represent management’s expectations of the deterioration
of our portfolios or the economic environment, but are
provided as hypothetical scenarios to assess the sensitivity
of the allowance for credit losses to changes in key inputs.
If commercial real estate property values were increased
10% and all other credits were rated one grade better, the
quantitative allowance would have decreased by $43
million, and if commercial real estate property values were
decreased 10% and all other credits were rated one

30 BNY

grade worse, the quantitative allowance would have
increased by $76 million. Our multi-scenario-based
macroeconomic forecast used in determining the June 30,
2024 allowance for credit losses consisted of three
scenarios. The baseline scenario reflects positive but
slightly declining GDP growth, stable unemployment and
slightly declining commercial real estate prices through the
end of 2024. The upside scenario reflects higher GDP
growth through the third quarter 2024 before moderating,
declining unemployment through the end of 2024 and
stable commercial real estate prices through the end of
2024 compared with the baseline. The downside scenario
contemplates negative GDP growth through the third
quarter of 2024 before moderating, rapidly increasing
unemployment through mid-2025 and sharply lower
commercial real estate prices than the baseline. At June 30,
2024, we placed the most weight on our baseline scenario,
with the remaining weighting placed on the upside and
downside scenarios. From a sensitivity perspective, at June
30, 2024, if we had applied 100% weighting to the
downside scenario, the allowance for credit losses would
have been approximately $91 million higher.

Liquidity and dividends

(“FICC”), where we record interest expense on a gross
basis, but the ending and average balances reflect the
impact of offsetting under enforceable netting agreements.
This activity primarily relates to government securities
collateralized resale and repurchase agreements executed
with clients that are novated to and settle with the FICC.

Payables to customers and broker-dealers represent funds
awaiting reinvestment and short sale proceeds payable on
demand. Payables to customers and broker-dealers are
driven by customer trading activity and market volatility.

The Bank of New York Mellon may issue commercial
paper that matures within 397 days from the date of issue
and is not redeemable prior to maturity or subject to
voluntary prepayment.

Other borrowed funds primarily include borrowings from
the Federal Home Loan Bank, overdrafts of sub-custodian
account balances in our Securities Services businesses,
finance lease liabilities and borrowings under lines of
credit by our Pershing subsidiaries. Overdrafts typically
relate to timing differences for settlements.

BNY defines liquidity as the ability of the Parent and its
subsidiaries to access funding or convert assets to cash
quickly and efficiently, or to roll over or issue new debt,
especially during periods of market stress, at a reasonable
cost, and in order to meet its short-term (up to one year)
obligations. Funding liquidity risk is the risk that BNY
cannot meet its cash and collateral obligations at a
reasonable cost for both expected and unexpected cash
flow and collateral needs without adversely affecting daily
operations or our financial condition. Funding liquidity risk
can arise from funding mismatches, market constraints
from the inability to convert assets into cash, the inability
to hold or raise cash, low overnight deposits, deposit run-
off or contingent liquidity events.

Changes in economic conditions or exposure to credit,
market, operational, legal and reputational risks also can
affect BNY’s liquidity risk profile and are considered in
our liquidity risk framework. For additional information,
see “Risk Management – Liquidity Risk” in our 2023
Annual Report.

Deposits

Total deposits were $304.3 billion at June 30, 2024, an
increase of 7%, compared with $283.7 billion at Dec. 31,
2023. The increase primarily reflects higher interest-
bearing deposits in U.S. offices and interest-bearing
deposits in non-U.S. offices.

Noninterest-bearing deposits were $58.0 billion at June 30,
2024, compared with $58.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.
Interest-bearing deposits were primarily demand deposits
and totaled $246.3 billion at June 30, 2024, compared with
$225.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.

Short-term borrowings

We fund ourselves primarily through deposits and, to a
lesser extent, other short-term borrowings and long-term
debt. Short-term borrowings consist of federal funds
purchased and securities sold under repurchase
agreements, payables to customers and broker-dealers,
commercial paper and other borrowed funds. Certain short-
term borrowings, for example, securities sold under
repurchase agreements, require the delivery of securities as
collateral.

Federal funds purchased and securities sold under
repurchase agreements include repurchase agreement
activity with the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation

BNY 31

The Parent’s policy is to have access to sufficient
unencumbered cash and cash equivalents at each quarter-
end to cover maturities and other forecasted debt
redemptions, net interest payments and net tax payments
for the following 18-month period, and to provide
sufficient collateral to satisfy transactions subject to
Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act.

BNY also manages potential intraday liquidity risks. We
monitor and manage intraday liquidity against existing and
expected intraday liquid resources (such as cash balances,
remaining intraday credit capacity, intraday contingency
funding and available collateral) to enable BNY to meet its
intraday obligations under normal and reasonably severe
stressed conditions.

We monitor and control liquidity exposures and funding
needs within and across significant legal entities, branches,
currencies and business lines, taking into account, among
other factors, any applicable restrictions on the transfer of
liquidity among entities.

We define available funds for internal liquidity
management purposes as cash and due from banks,
interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and
other central banks, interest-bearing deposits with banks
and federal funds sold and securities purchased under
resale agreements.

Total available funds were $162.7 billion at June 30, 2024,
compared with $157.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. The
increase was primarily due to higher interest-bearing
deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central banks.

Average non-core sources of funds, such as federal funds
purchased and securities sold under repurchase
agreements, trading liabilities, commercial paper and other
borrowed funds, were $19.5 billion for the first six months
of 2024, compared with $27.5 billion for the first six
months of 2023. The decrease primarily reflects lower
federal funds purchased and securities sold under
repurchase agreements and lower trading liabilities.

Average interest-bearing domestic deposits were
$140.6 billion for the first six months of 2024, compared
with $119.3 billion for the first six months of 2023.
Average interest-bearing foreign deposits, primarily from
our European-based businesses included in the Securities
Services and Market and Wealth Services segments, were
$91.8 billion for the first six months of 2024, compared
with $90.3 billion

for the first six months of 2023. The changes primarily
reflect client activity.

Average payables to customers and broker-dealers were
$12.2 billion for the first six months of 2024 and $15.9
billion for the first six months of 2023. Payables to
customers and broker-dealers are driven by customer
trading activity and market volatility.

Average long-term debt was $31.3 billion for the first six
months of 2024 and $31.1 billion for the first six months of
2023.

Average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased to $49.5
billion for the first six months of 2024 from $66.0 billion
for the first six months of 2023, primarily reflecting client
activity.

A significant reduction of client activity in our Securities
Services and Market and Wealth Services business
segments would reduce our access to deposits. See
“Asset/liability management” for additional factors that
could impact our deposit balances.

Sources of liquidity

The Parent’s major sources of liquidity are access to the debt and equity markets, dividends from its subsidiaries, and cash on
hand and cash otherwise made available in business-as-usual circumstances to the Parent through a committed credit facility
with our intermediate holding company (“IHC”).

Our ability to access the capital markets on favorable terms, or at all, is partially dependent on our credit ratings, which are as

NR – Not rated.

Long-term debt totaled $30.9 billion at June 30, 2024 and
$31.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. Maturities and redemptions
of $2.6 billion and a decrease in the fair value of hedged
long-term debt were offset by issuances totaling $2.5
billion. Long-term debt of $2.6 billion will mature in the
remainder of 2024.

In July, the Parent issued $2.5 billion of long-term debt in
four tranches:

•

•

•

$300 million of floating rate senior notes maturing in
2028 with an annual interest rate of compounded
secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) plus 83
basis points,
$600 million of fixed to floating rate senior notes
maturing in 2028. The annual fixed interest rate is
4.890% from issuance to, but excluding, July 21, 2027,
and then an annual interest rate of compounded SOFR
plus 84 basis points,
$1.1 billion of fixed to floating rate senior notes
maturing in 2032. The annual fixed interest rate

is 5.060% from issuance to, but excluding, July 22,
2031, and then an annual interest rate of compounded
SOFR plus 123 basis points, and

•

$500 million of fixed to floating rate senior
subordinated notes maturing in 2039. The annual fixed
interest rate is 5.606% from issuance to, but excluding,
July 21, 2034, and then an annual interest rate of
compounded SOFR plus 177 basis points.

The Bank of New York Mellon may issue notes and
certificates of deposit (“CDs”). At June 30, 2024 and Dec.
31, 2023, $1.8 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, of
notes were outstanding. At June 30, 2024 and Dec. 31,
2023, $1.3 billion and $397 million, respectively, of CDs
were outstanding.

The Bank of New York Mellon also issues commercial
paper that matures within 397 days from the date of issue
and is not redeemable prior to maturity or subject to
voluntary prepayment. There

BNY 33

  
 
was $301 million of commercial paper outstanding at June
30, 2024. There was no commercial paper outstanding at
Dec. 31, 2023. The average commercial paper outstanding
was $481 million for the first six months of 2024 and
$3 million for the first six months of 2023.

Subsequent to June 30, 2024, our U.S. bank subsidiaries
could declare dividends to the Parent of approximately
$1.3 billion, without the need for a regulatory waiver. In
addition, at June 30, 2024, non-bank subsidiaries of the
Parent had liquid assets of approximately $3.6 billion.
Restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our
subsidiaries are discussed in more detail in “Supervision
and Regulation – Capital Planning and Stress Testing –
Payment of Dividends, Stock Repurchases and Other
Capital Distributions” and in Note 19 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, both in our 2023
Annual Report.

Pershing LLC has one uncommitted line of credit in place
for funding purposes that is guaranteed by the Parent for
$300 million. There were no borrowings under this line in
the second quarter of 2024. Pershing Limited, an indirect
UK-based subsidiary of BNY, has two separate
uncommitted lines of credit amounting to $257 million in
aggregate. Average borrowings under these lines were $1
million in the second quarter of 2024.

The double leverage ratio is the ratio of our equity
investment in subsidiaries divided by our consolidated
Parent company equity, which includes our noncumulative
perpetual preferred stock. In short, the double leverage
ratio measures the extent to which equity in subsidiaries is
financed by Parent company debt. As the double leverage
ratio increases, this can reflect greater demands on a
company’s cash flows in order to service interest payments
and debt maturities. BNY’s double leverage ratio is
managed in a range considering the high level of
unencumbered available liquid assets held in its principal
subsidiaries (such as central bank deposit placements and
government securities), the Company’s cash generating
fee-based business model, with fee revenue representing
74% of total revenue in the second quarter of 2024, and the
dividend capacity of our banking subsidiaries. Our double
leverage ratio was 120.6% at June 30, 2024 and 120.5% at
Dec. 31, 2023, and within the range targeted by
management.

34 BNY

Uses of funds

The Parent’s major uses of funds are repurchases of
common stock, payment of dividends, principal and
interest payments on its borrowings, acquisitions and
additional investments in its subsidiaries.

In June 2024, a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per common
share was paid to common shareholders. Our common
stock dividend payout ratio was 28% for the second quarter
of 2024.

In July 2024, our Board of Directors approved a 12%
increase in the quarterly cash dividend on common stock,
from $0.42 to $0.47 per share. The increased quarterly cash
dividend was paid on Aug. 2, 2024.

In the second quarter of 2024, we repurchased 10.3 million
common shares at an average price of $58.52 per common
share, for a total cost of $601 million.

Liquidity coverage ratio (“LCR”)

U.S. regulators have established an LCR that requires
certain banking organizations, including BNY, to maintain
a minimum amount of unencumbered high-quality liquid
assets (“HQLA”) sufficient to withstand the net cash
outflow under a hypothetical standardized acute liquidity
stress scenario for a 30-day time horizon.

The following table presents BNY’s consolidated HQLA,
and the average HQLA and average LCR.

and averaged $137 billion for the second quarter of 2024 and $143
billion for the first quarter of 2024.

BNY and each of our affected domestic bank subsidiaries
were compliant with the U.S. LCR requirements of at least
100% throughout the second quarter of 2024.

Net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”)

The NSFR is a liquidity requirement applicable to large
U.S. banking organizations, including BNY. The NSFR is
expressed as a ratio of the available stable funding to the
required stable funding amount over a one-year horizon.
Our average consolidated NSFR was 132% for the second
quarter of 2024 and 136% for the first quarter of 2024.

BNY and each of our affected domestic bank subsidiaries
were compliant with the NSFR requirement of at least
100% throughout the second quarter of 2024.

Statement of cash flows

The following summarizes the activity reflected on the
consolidated statement of cash flows. While this
information may be helpful to highlight certain macro
trends and business strategies, the cash flow analysis may
not be as relevant when analyzing changes in our net
earnings and net assets. We believe that in addition to the
traditional cash flow analysis, the discussion related to
liquidity and dividends and asset/liability management
herein may provide more useful context in evaluating our
liquidity position and related activity.

Net cash used for operating activities was $551 million in
the six months ended June 30, 2024,

compared with net cash provided by operating activities of
$2.9 billion in the six months ended June 30, 2023. In the
six months ended June 30, 2024, cash flows used for
operations primarily resulted from changes in trading
assets and liabilities and changes in accruals and other, net,
partially offset by earnings. In the six months ended June
30, 2023, cash flows provided by operations primarily
resulted from earnings.

Net cash used for investing activities was $21.3 billion in
the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared with $25.1
billion in the six months ended June 30, 2023. In the six
months ended June 30, 2024, net cash used for investing
activities primarily resulted from changes in securities,
interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and
other central banks and loans. In the six months ended June
30, 2023, net cash used for investing activities primarily
resulted from changes in interest-bearing deposits with the
Federal Reserve and other central banks and changes in
federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale
agreements, partially offset by net changes in securities and
changes in interest-bearing deposits with banks.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $21.0 billion
in the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared with
$20.0 billion in the six months ended June 30, 2023. In the
six months ended June 30, 2024, net cash provided by
financing activities primarily resulted from changes in
deposits. In the six months ended June 30, 2023, net cash
provided by financing activities primarily resulted from
changes in deposits and changes in federal funds purchased
and securities sold under repurchase agreements.

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation total
shareholders’ equity was $40.8 billion at June 30, 2024 and
Dec. 31, 2023, reflecting earnings, offset by common stock
repurchases and dividend payments.

The unrealized loss (after-tax) on our available-for-sale
securities portfolio, net of hedges, included in accumulated
other comprehensive income was $1.5 billion at June 30,
2024, compared with $1.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. Net
unrealized loss, including the impact of hedges, decreased
as securities moved closer to maturity, partially offset by
the impact of higher interest rates.

In the first six months of 2024, we repurchased 28.1
million common shares at an average price of $56.47 per
common share for a total cost of $1.6 billion.

In January 2023, we announced a share repurchase
program approved by our Board of Directors providing for
the repurchase of up to $5.0 billion of common shares
beginning Jan. 1, 2023. This share repurchase plan
replaced all previously authorized share repurchase plans.

In April 2024, we announced a new authorization
providing for the repurchase of $6.0 billion of common
shares in addition to any remaining capacity under the
existing January 2023 authorization.

In July 2024, our Board of Directors approved a 12%
increase in the quarterly cash dividend on common stock,
from $0.42 to $0.47 per share. The increased quarterly cash
dividend was paid on Aug. 2, 2024.

Capital adequacy

Regulators establish certain levels of capital for bank
holding companies (“BHCs”) and banks, including BNY
and our bank subsidiaries, in accordance with established
quantitative measurements. For the Parent to maintain its
status as a financial holding company, our U.S. bank
subsidiaries and BNY must, among other things, qualify as
“well capitalized.” As of June 30, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023,
BNY and our U.S. bank subsidiaries were “well
capitalized.” Failure to satisfy regulatory standards,
including “well capitalized” status or capital adequacy
rules more generally, could result in limitations on our
activities and adversely affect our financial condition. See
the discussion of these matters in “Supervision and
Regulation – Regulated Entities of BNY Mellon and
Ancillary Regulatory Requirements” and “Risk Factors –
Capital and Liquidity Risk – Failure to satisfy regulatory
standards, including “well capitalized” and “well
managed” status or capital adequacy and liquidity rules
more generally, could result in limitations on our activities
and adversely affect our business and financial condition,”
both of which are in our 2023 Annual Report.

The U.S. banking agencies’ capital rules are based on the
framework adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision, as amended from time to time. For additional
information on these capital requirements, see
“Supervision and Regulation” in our 2023 Annual Report.

(a)    Minimum requirements for June 30, 2024 include minimum thresholds plus currently applicable buffers. The U.S. global systemically important banks

(“G-SIB”) surcharge of 1.5% is subject to change. The countercyclical capital buffer is currently set to 0%. The stress capital buffer (“SCB”)
requirement is 2.5%, equal to the regulatory minimum for Standardized Approach capital ratios.

(b)    For our CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios, our effective capital ratios under U.S. capital rules are the lower of the ratios as calculated

under the Standardized and Advanced Approaches. The Tier 1 leverage ratio is based on Tier 1 capital and quarterly average total assets.

(c)    The Federal Reserve’s regulations do not establish well capitalized thresholds for these measures for BHCs.
(d)    The SLR is based on Tier 1 capital and total leverage exposure, which includes certain off-balance sheet exposures.
N/A – Not applicable.

Our CET1 ratio under the Standardized Approach was
11.4% at June 30, 2024 and 11.5% at Dec. 31, 2023 under
the Advanced Approaches. The decrease was driven by
higher risk-weighted assets, partially offset by the increase
in capital.

The Tier 1 leverage ratio was 5.8% at June 30, 2024 and
6.0% at Dec. 31, 2023. The decrease reflects higher
average assets, partially offset by the increase in capital.

Risk-based capital ratios vary depending on the size of the
balance sheet at period end and the levels and types of
investments in assets, and leverage ratios vary based on the
average size of the balance sheet over the quarter. The
balance sheet size fluctuates from period to period based
on levels of customer and market activity. In general, when
servicing clients are more actively trading securities,
deposit balances and the balance sheet as a whole are
higher. In addition, when markets experience significant
volatility or stress, our balance sheet size may increase
considerably as client deposit levels increase.

Our capital ratios are necessarily subject to, among other
things, anticipated compliance with all necessary
enhancements to model calibration, approval by regulators
of certain models used as part of RWA calculations, other
refinements, further implementation guidance from
regulators, market practices and standards and any changes
BNY may make to its businesses. As a consequence of
these factors, our capital ratios may materially change, and
may be volatile over time and from period to period.

Under the Advanced Approaches, our operational loss risk
model is informed by external losses, including fines and
penalties levied against institutions in the financial services
industry, particularly those that relate to businesses in
which we operate, and as a result, external losses have
impacted and could in the future impact the amount of
capital that we are required to hold.

Stress capital buffer

In July 2023, the Federal Reserve announced that BNY’s
SCB requirement would remain at 2.5%, equal to the
regulatory floor, for the period from Oct. 1, 2023 through
Sept. 30, 2024. The SCB replaced the static 2.5% capital
conservation buffer for Standardized Approach capital
ratios for CCAR BHCs. The SCB does not apply to bank
subsidiaries, which remain subject to the static 2.5%
capital conservation buffer. In June 2024, the Federal
Reserve notified BNY that its preliminary SCB
requirement would remain at 2.5%, equal to the regulatory
floor, for the period from Oct. 1, 2024 through Sept. 30,
2025. See “Supervision and Regulation” in our 2023
Annual Report for additional information.

The SCB final rule generally eliminates the requirement
for prior approval of common stock repurchases in excess
of the distributions in a firm’s capital plan, provided that
such distributions are consistent with applicable capital
requirements and buffers, including the SCB.

consists of the unpaid principal balance of eligible
unsecured debt securities, subject to haircuts for amounts
due to be paid within two years, that satisfy certain other
conditions. Debt issued prior to Dec. 31, 2016 has been

Trading activities and risk management

Our trading activities are focused on acting as a market-
maker for our customers, facilitating customer trades and
risk-mitigating hedging in compliance with the Volcker
Rule. The risk from market-making activities for customers
is managed by our traders and limited in total exposure
through a system of position limits, value-at-risk (“VaR”)
methodology and other market sensitivity measures. VaR is
the potential loss in value due to adverse market
movements over a defined time horizon with a specified
confidence level. The calculation of our VaR used by
management and presented below assumes a one-day
holding period, utilizes a 99% confidence level and
incorporates non-linear product characteristics. VaR
facilitates comparisons across portfolios of different risk
characteristics. VaR also captures the diversification of
aggregated risk at the firm-wide level.

BNY 39

VaR represents a key risk management measure, and it is
important to note the inherent limitations to VaR, which
include:
• VaR does not estimate potential losses over longer time

horizons where moves may be extreme;

• VaR does not take into account the potential variability

of market liquidity; and

• Previous moves in market risk factors may not produce

accurate predictions of all future market moves.

See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information on the VaR
methodology.

The following tables indicate the calculated VaR amounts
for the trading portfolio for the designated periods using
the historical simulation VaR model.

N/M – Because the minimum and maximum may occur on different days for
different risk components, it is not meaningful to compute a minimum
and maximum portfolio diversification effect.

The interest rate component of VaR represents instruments
whose values are predominantly driven by interest rate
levels. These instruments include, but are not limited to,
U.S. Treasury securities, swaps, swaptions, forward rate
agreements, exchange-traded futures and options, and other
interest rate derivative products.

The foreign exchange component of VaR represents
instruments whose values predominantly vary with the
level or volatility of currency exchange rates or interest
rates. These instruments include, but are not limited to,
currency balances, spot and forward transactions, currency
options and other currency derivative products.

The equity component of VaR consists of instruments that
represent an ownership interest in the form of domestic and
foreign common stock or other equity-linked instruments.
These instruments include, but are not limited to, common
stock, exchange-traded funds, preferred stock, listed equity
options (puts and calls), OTC equity options, equity total
return swaps, equity index futures and other equity
derivative products.

The credit component of VaR represents instruments whose
values are predominantly driven by credit spread levels,
i.e., idiosyncratic default risk. These instruments include,
but are not limited to, single issuer credit default swaps,
and securities with exposures from corporate and
municipal credit spreads.

The diversification component of VaR is the risk reduction
benefit that occurs when combining portfolios and
offsetting positions, and from the correlated behavior of
risk factor movements.

40 BNY

During the second quarter of 2024, interest rate risk
generated 40% of average gross VaR, foreign exchange
risk generated 35% of average gross VaR, credit risk
generated 23% of average gross VaR and equity risk
generated 2% of average gross. During the second quarter
of 2024, our daily trading loss did not exceed our
calculated VaR amount of the overall portfolio.

The following table of total daily trading revenue or loss
illustrates the number of trading days in which our trading
revenue or loss fell within particular ranges during the past
five quarters. The number of trading days when trading
revenue was more than $5 million increased compared
with the second quarter of 2023 primarily due to higher
foreign exchange volumes and higher client activity in our
fixed income and equity trading business. The number of
trading days when trading revenue was more than $5
million increased compared with the first quarter of 2024
primarily due to higher foreign exchange volumes.

Trading assets include debt and equity instruments and
derivative assets, primarily foreign exchange and interest
rate contracts, not designated as hedging instruments.
Trading assets were $9.6 billion at June 30, 2024 and $10.1
billion at Dec. 31, 2023.

Trading liabilities include debt and equity instruments and

interest rate contracts, not designated as hedging
instruments. Trading liabilities were $3.4 billion at June
30, 2024 and $6.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.

we consider credit risk in arriving at the fair value of our
derivatives.

We reflect external credit ratings as well as observable
credit default swap spreads for both ourselves and our
counterparties when measuring the fair value of our
derivative positions. Accordingly, the valuation of our
derivative positions is sensitive to the current changes in
our own credit spreads, as well as those of our
counterparties.

At June 30, 2024, our OTC derivative assets, including
those in hedging relationships, of $1.4 billion included a
credit valuation adjustment (“CVA”) deduction of $12
million. Our OTC derivative liabilities, including those in
hedging relationships, of $1.9 billion included a debit
valuation adjustment (“DVA”) of $5 million related to our
own credit spread. Net of hedges, the CVA increased by
less than $1 million and the DVA decreased by less than $1
million in the second quarter of 2024, which decreased
investment and other revenue – other trading revenue by
less than $1 million. The net impact of the CVA and DVA,
net of hedges, did not impact investment and other revenue
– other trading revenue in the first quarter of 2024. The net
impact of the CVA and DVA, net of hedges, decreased
investment and other revenue – other trading revenue by
less than $1 million in the second quarter of 2023.

The table below summarizes our exposure, net of collateral
related to our derivative counterparties, as determined on
an internal risk management basis. Significant changes in
counterparty credit ratings could alter the level of credit
risk faced by BNY.

Asset/liability management

Under our fair value methodology for derivative contracts,
an initial “risk-neutral” valuation is performed on each
position assuming time discounting based on a AA credit
curve. In addition,

Our diversified business activities include processing
securities, accepting deposits, investing in securities,
lending, raising money as needed to fund assets and other
transactions. The market risks from these

BNY 41

activities include interest rate risk and foreign exchange
risk. Our primary market risk is exposure to movements in
U.S. dollar interest rates and certain foreign currency
interest rates. We actively manage interest rate sensitivity
and use earnings simulation and discounted cash flow
models to identify interest rate exposures.

An earnings simulation model is the primary tool used to
assess changes in pre-tax net interest income between a
baseline scenario and hypothetical interest rate scenarios.
Interest rate sensitivity is quantified by calculating the
change in pre-tax net interest income between the scenarios
over a 12-month measurement period.

The baseline scenario incorporates the market’s forward
rate expectations and management’s assumptions regarding
client deposit rates, credit spreads, changes in the
prepayment behavior of loans and securities and the impact
of derivative financial instruments used for interest rate
risk management purposes as of each respective quarter-
end. These assumptions have been developed through a
combination of historical analysis and future expected
pricing behavior and are inherently uncertain. Actual
results may differ materially from projected results due to
timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes,
and changes in market conditions and management’s
strategies, among other factors. Client deposit levels and
mix are key assumptions impacting net interest income in
the baseline as well as the hypothetical interest rate
scenarios. The earnings simulation model assumes static
deposit levels and mix, and it also assumes that no
management actions will be taken to mitigate the effects of
interest rate changes. Typically, the baseline scenario uses
the average deposit balances of the quarter.

In the table below, we use the earnings simulation model to
assess the impact of various hypothetical interest rate
scenarios compared to the baseline scenario. In each of the
scenarios, all currencies’ interest rates are instantaneously
shifted higher or lower at the start of the forecast. Long-
term interest rates are defined as all tenors equal to or
greater than three years and short-term interest rates are
defined as all tenors equal to or less than three months.
Interim term points are interpolated where applicable. The
impact of interest rate shifts may not be linear. The results
of this earnings simulation should therefore not be
extrapolated for more severe interest rate scenarios than
those presented in the table below.

The following table shows net interest income sensitivity
for BNY.

At June 30, 2024, the change in the impact of a 100 bps
upward or downward shift in rates on net interest income
compared with March 31, 2024 was primarily driven by
higher deposits and cash balances.

While the net interest income sensitivity scenario
calculations assume static deposit balances to facilitate
consistent period-over-period comparisons, net interest
income is impacted by changes in deposit balances.
Noninterest-bearing deposits are particularly sensitive to
changes in short-term rates.

To illustrate the net interest income sensitivity to
noninterest-bearing deposits, we estimate that a $5 billion
instantaneous reduction/increase in U.S. dollar-
denominated noninterest-bearing deposits would
reduce/increase the net interest income sensitivity results in
the up 100 basis point scenario in the table above by
approximately $300 million, and in the down 100 basis
point scenario by approximately $200 million. The impact
would be smaller if the reduction/increase was assumed to
be a mixture of interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing
deposits.

Additionally, during periods of low short-term interest
rates, money market mutual fund fees and other similar
fees are typically waived to protect investors from negative
returns.

For a discussion of factors impacting the growth or
contraction of deposits, see “Risk Factors – Capital and
Liquidity Risk – Our business, financial condition and
results of operations could be adversely affected if we do
not effectively manage our liquidity” in our 2023 Annual
Report.

Supplemental information – Explanation of GAAP
and Non-GAAP financial measures

BNY has included in this Form 10-Q certain Non-GAAP
financial measures on a tangible basis as a supplement to
GAAP information, which exclude goodwill and intangible
assets, net of deferred tax liabilities. We believe that the
return on tangible common equity – Non-GAAP is
additional useful information for investors because it
presents a measure of those assets that can generate
income, and the tangible book value per common share –
Non-GAAP is additional useful information because it
presents the level of tangible assets in relation to shares of
common stock outstanding.

BNY has also included revenue measures excluding
notable items, including the reduction in the fair value of a
contingent consideration receivable related to a prior year
divestiture and a disposal loss. Expense measures,
excluding notable items, including the FDIC special
assessment, severance expense and litigation reserves, are
also presented. Litigation reserves represent accruals for
loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably
estimable, but exclude standard business-related legal fees.
Net income applicable to common shareholders of The
Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, diluted earnings
per share, return on common equity, return on tangible
common equity and pre-tax operating

margin, excluding the notable items mentioned above, are
also provided. These measures are provided to permit
investors to view the financial measures on a basis
consistent with how management views the businesses.

The presentation of the growth rates of investment
management and performance fees on a constant currency
basis permits investors to assess the significance of
changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Growth rates
on a constant currency basis were determined by applying
the current period foreign currency exchange rates to the
prior period revenue. We believe that this presentation, as a
supplement to GAAP information, gives investors a clearer
picture of the related revenue results without the variability
caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

BNY has also included the adjusted pre-tax operating
margin – Non-GAAP, which is the pre-tax operating
margin for the Investment and Wealth Management
business segment, net of distribution and servicing expense
that was passed to third parties who distribute or service
our managed funds. We believe that this measure is useful
when evaluating the performance of the Investment and
Wealth Management business segment relative to industry
competitors.

Recent regulatory and other developments

Recent accounting developments

The following accounting guidance issued by the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) has not yet been
adopted as of June 30, 2024.

ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280):
Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07,
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to
Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires a public
entity to disclose, on an annual and interim basis,
significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to
the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) and
included within each reported measure of segment profit or
loss (collectively referred to as the “significant expense
principle”). In addition, disclosure will be required of the
title and position of CODM, and how the CODM uses the
reported measure of segment profit or loss in assessing
segment performance and deciding how to allocate
resources.

This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after
Dec. 15, 2023 and interim periods beginning in 2025, with
early adoption permitted. BNY is currently evaluating this
guidance and the impact on the business segment
disclosures.

ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to
Income Tax Disclosures

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income
Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax
Disclosures, which requires a company to disclose, on an
annual basis, additional disaggregated information related
to the existing disclosures for the effective income tax rate
reconciliation and income taxes paid.

This ASU is effective on a prospective basis, with a
retrospective option, for annual periods beginning after
Dec. 15, 2024, and interim periods within fiscal years
beginning after Dec. 15, 2025. BNY is currently evaluating
this guidance and the impact on the income tax disclosures.

For a summary of additional regulatory matters relevant to
our operations, see “Recent regulatory developments” in
our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, and
“Supervision and Regulation” in our 2023 Annual Report.
The following discussion summarizes certain regulatory,
legislative and other developments that may affect BNY.

SEC Amendments to Regulation S-P

On May 16, 2024, the SEC adopted amendments (the “S-P
Amendments”) to Regulation S-P, which governs the
safeguarding, treatment and disposal of customer records
and information by certain financial institutions, to
enhance the protection of customer financial information
and establish a federal minimum standard for data breach
notifications to affected individuals by brokers, dealers,
investment companies, registered investment advisers and
transfer agents (“S-P covered institutions”). The S-P
Amendments: (i) extend certain requirements of
Regulation S-P to transfer agents registered with the SEC
or another appropriate regulatory agency; (ii) require S-P
covered institutions to develop, implement, and maintain
written policies and procedures for an incident response
program that is reasonably designed to detect, respond to,
and recover from unauthorized access to or use of
customer information; (iii) set forth a data breach
notification requirement that requires S-P covered
institutions to notify affected individuals whose customer
information was, or is reasonably likely to have been,
accessed or used without authorization (subject to certain
exceptions) within 30 days after the S-P covered institution
becomes aware that unauthorized access to or use of
customer information has, or is reasonably likely to have,
occurred; (iv) broaden the group of customers whose
information is protected; (v) address the use of service
providers by S-P covered institutions; and (vi) codify an
existing statutory exemption to the requirement to provide
annual privacy notices to customers. The S-P Amendments
are effective as of Aug. 2, 2024 and BNY will have 18
months to come into compliance. BNY is evaluating the
impact of the S-P Amendments.

EU Basel 3.1 Implementation: CRR3/CRD6

On June 19, 2024, the texts of the Capital Requirements
Regulation (“CRR”) III and Capital Requirements
Directive (“CRD”) VI, were formally published in the
Official Journal of the EU. Through these regulations, the
EU will implement the Basel 3.1 standards, which affect
the capital and liquidity requirements of European banking
entities, including The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV,
and will restrict the provision of prescribed core banking
services (including lending, the provision of guarantees
and commitments, and the taking of deposits or other
repayable funds) by non-EU entities to EU customers,
except where these services are provided through an
authorized EU branch or where an exemption applies. The
new regime will enter into force in phases beginning July
9, 2024 through to Jan. 11, 2027. BNY is assessing the
impact of the rules.

EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive

On May 24, 2024, the Council of the European Union
formally adopted the Corporate Sustainability Due
Diligence Directive (“CSDDD”). CSDDD applies to large
EU companies and non-EU companies with significant EU
activity. In-scope companies will be required to comply
with due diligence obligations for their operations and for
their upstream chains of activities and to adopt a transition
plan for climate change mitigation. In addition to penalties
for non-compliance, CSDDD will subject in-scope
companies to potential civil liability, including potential
injunctive relief and monetary damages. Publication of
CSDDD in the Official Journal of the EU and entry into
force is expected in or around the third quarter of 2024.
CSDDD will apply on a phased-in basis starting three
years after CSDDD’s entry into force, dependent on a
company’s number of employees and net worldwide or EU
turnover. BNY is assessing the potential impact of CSDDD
on its business.

FDIC Amendments to Resolution Planning Rules

On June 20, 2024, the FDIC issued a final rule amending
its resolution planning rule applicable to covered insured
depository institutions (“IDIs”). The amended rule: (i)
adjusts the frequency of resolution plan submissions by
IDIs affiliated with a U.S. global systemically important
banking organization (“US GSIB”), including The Bank of
New York Mellon, from a 3-year cycle to a 2-year cycle;
(ii) expands resolution plan content requirements; (iii)
requires

IDIs to provide the FDIC with notice within 45 days of
certain “extraordinary events”; and (iv) revises certain
definitions to be more consistent with similar concepts and
approaches under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”). The final
rule will be effective Oct. 1, 2024. We are evaluating the
impact of the final rule.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1–Basis of presentation

In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, references to
“our,” “we,” “us,” “BNY,” the “Company” and similar
terms refer to The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation
and its consolidated subsidiaries. The term “Parent” refers
to The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation but not to its
subsidiaries.

Basis of presentation

The accounting and financial reporting policies of BNY, a
global financial services company, conform to U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and
prevailing industry practices. For information on our
significant accounting and reporting policies, see Note 1 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31,
2023 (the “2023 Annual Report”).

The accompanying consolidated financial statements are
unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments
necessary, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, for a
fair presentation of financial position, results of operations
and cash flows for the periods presented have been made.
These financial statements should be read in conjunction
with our Consolidated Financial Statements included in our
2023 Annual Report.

On Jan. 1, 2024, we adopted Accounting Standards Update
(“ASU”) 2023-02, Investments—Equity Method and Joint
Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax
Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization
Method on a retrospective basis for our investments in
renewable energy projects that have met the eligibility
criteria, and restated prior period financial statements. See
Note 2 for additional information.

Use of estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates based
upon assumptions about future economic and market
conditions which affect reported amounts and related
disclosures in our

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

financial statements. Although our current estimates
contemplate current conditions and how we expect them to
change in the future, it is reasonably possible that actual
conditions could be worse than anticipated in those
estimates, which could materially affect our results of
operations and financial condition.

Note 2–New accounting guidance

The following accounting guidance was adopted on Jan. 1,
2024.

ASU 2023-02, Investments—Equity Method and Joint
Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax
Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization

In March 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued ASU 2023-02, Investments—Equity
Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for
Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the
Proportional Amortization Method, which permits
reporting entities to elect to account for their tax equity
investments, regardless of the tax credit program from
which the income tax credits are received, using the
proportional amortization method if certain conditions are
met. Under the proportional amortization method, an entity
amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to
the income tax credits and other income tax benefits
received, and recognizes the net amortization and income
tax credits and other income tax benefits in the income
statement as a component of the provision for income
taxes.

We adopted this guidance on Jan.1, 2024. The impact of
adopting this new guidance for our renewable energy
investments that met the eligibility criteria was an increase
in investment and other revenue and an increase in the
provision for income taxes on the consolidated income
statement. Renewable energy investments are recorded in
other assets on the balance sheet. In the first quarter of
2024, we restated the prior period financial statements to
reflect the impact of the retrospective application of the
new accounting guidance. The required disclosures are
included in Note 7.

Note 3–Acquisitions and dispositions

We sometimes structure our acquisitions and divestitures
with both an initial payment or receipt and later contingent
payments or receipts tied to post-closing revenue or
income growth.

At June 30, 2024, we are potentially obligated to pay
additional consideration which is recorded at fair value
totaling approximately $20 million and, using reasonable
assumptions and estimates, could range

from $15 million to $20 million over the next year.
Contingent payments totaled $5 million in the first six
months of 2024 and we recorded $1 million of increases to
contingent earnout payables reflected in other expense.

At June 30, 2024, we could potentially receive additional
consideration which is recorded at fair value totaling
approximately $30 million and, using reasonable
assumptions and estimates, could range from $20 million
to $40 million over the next four years. There were no
contingent receipts in the first six months of 2024.

Statements in our 2023 Annual Report for additional

Allowance for credit losses – Securities

The allowance for credit losses related to securities was
$6 million at June 30, 2024 and relates to non-agency
commercial MBS and non-agency RMBS securities. The
allowance for credit losses related to securities was $1
million at Dec. 31, 2023 and relates to non-agency RMBS
and other debt securities.

At June 30, 2024, the gross unrealized losses on the
securities portfolio were primarily attributable to an
increase in interest rates from the date of purchase, and for
certain securities that were transferred from available-for-
sale to held-to-maturity, an increase in interest rates
through the date they were transferred. Specifically, $130
million of the unrealized losses at June 30, 2024 and $146
million at Dec. 31, 2023 reflected in the tables below relate
to certain securities that were previously transferred from
available-for-sale to held-to-maturity. As the transfers
created a new cost basis for the securities, if these
securities have experienced unrealized losses since the date
of transfer, the corresponding unrealized losses would be
reflected in the held-to-maturity securities portfolio in the
following tables.

The following tables show the aggregate fair value of available-for-sale securities with a continuous unrealized loss position for
less than 12 months and those that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for 12 months or more without an
allowance for credit losses.

ratings classifications could indicate increased credit risk for us and could be accompanied by an increase in the allowance for
credit losses and/or a reduction in the fair value of our securities portfolio.

Pledged assets

Restricted cash and securities

At June 30, 2024, BNY had pledged assets of $140 billion,
including $93 billion pledged as collateral for potential
borrowings at the Federal Reserve Discount Window and
$9 billion pledged as collateral for borrowing at the
Federal Home Loan Bank. The components of the assets
pledged at June 30, 2024 included $122 billion of
securities, $13 billion of loans, $4 billion of trading assets
and $1 billion of interest-bearing deposits with banks.

If there has been no borrowing at the Federal Reserve
Discount Window, the Federal Reserve generally allows
banks to freely move assets in and out of their pledged
assets account to sell or repledge the assets for other
purposes. BNY regularly moves assets in and out of its
pledged assets account at the Federal Reserve as there have
been no borrowings.

At Dec. 31, 2023, BNY had pledged assets of $134 billion,
including $93 billion pledged as collateral for potential
borrowing at the Federal Reserve Discount Window and $9
billion pledged as collateral for borrowing at the Federal
Home Loan Bank. The components of the assets pledged at
Dec. 31, 2023 included $116 billion of securities, $13
billion of loans, $4 billion of trading assets and $1 billion
of interest-bearing deposits with banks.

At June 30, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023, pledged assets
included $24 billion and $24 billion, respectively, for
which the recipients were permitted to sell or repledge the
assets delivered.

We also obtain securities as collateral, including receipts
under resale agreements, securities borrowed, derivative
contracts and custody agreements, on terms which permit
us to sell or repledge the securities to others. At June 30,
2024 and Dec. 31, 2023, the market value of the securities
received that can be sold or repledged was $226 billion and
$212 billion, respectively. We routinely sell or repledge
these securities through delivery to third parties. As of June
30, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023, the market value of securities
collateral sold or repledged was $200 billion and $180
billion, respectively.

Cash and securities may be segregated under federal and
other regulations or requirements. At June 30, 2024 and
Dec. 31, 2023, cash segregated under federal and other
regulations or requirements was $2 billion and $3 billion,
respectively. Restricted cash is primarily included in
interest-bearing deposits with banks on the consolidated
balance sheet. Securities segregated under federal and
other regulations or requirements were $3 billion at June
30, 2024 and $3 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. Restricted
securities were sourced from securities purchased under
resale agreements and are included in federal funds sold
and securities purchased under resale agreements on the
consolidated balance sheet.

Loan modifications

Modified loans are evaluated to determine whether a
modification or restructuring with a borrower experiencing
financial difficulty results in principal forgiveness, an
interest rate reduction, an other-than-insignificant payment
delay, or a term extension. The modification could result in
a new loan or a continuation of the existing loan.

In the second quarter of 2024, we modified one
commercial real estate exposure, with a recorded
investment of $59 million and an unfunded lending
commitment of $1 million, by extending the maturity date.

At June 30, 2024, other residential mortgage loans that
were modified in the previous 12 months and that are now
past due by more than 90 days totaled $1 million.

In the first quarter of 2024, we modified one commercial
real estate exposure, with a recorded investment of $59
million and an unfunded lending commitment of $15
million, by extending the maturity dates. We also modified
one residential mortgage loan, with an aggregate recorded
investment of less than $1 million, by providing payment
modifications and extending the maturity date.

In the second quarter of 2023, we modified one
commercial real estate loan, with a recorded investment of

two residential mortgage loans, with an aggregate recorded
investment of less than $1 million, by extending the
maturity dates and reducing the interest rates.

Credit quality indicators

Our credit strategy is to focus on investment-grade clients that are active users of our non-credit services. Each customer is
assigned an internal credit rating, which is mapped to an external rating agency grade equivalent, if possible, based upon a
number of dimensions, which are continually evaluated and may change over time. The tables below provide information about
the credit profile of the loan portfolio by the period of origination.

business days.

(b)    The gross write-offs related to other residential mortgage loans were $3 million in 2023.

Commercial loans

Financial institutions

The commercial loan portfolio is divided into investment
grade and non-investment grade categories based on the
assigned internal credit ratings, which are generally
consistent with those of the public rating agencies.
Customers with ratings consistent with BBB- (S&P)/Baa3
(Moody’s) or better are considered to be investment grade.
Those clients with ratings lower than this threshold are
considered to be non-investment grade.

Commercial real estate

Our income-producing commercial real estate facilities are
focused on experienced owners and are structured with
moderate leverage based on existing cash flows. Our
commercial real estate lending activities also include
construction and renovation facilities.

Financial institution exposures are high quality, with 97%
of the exposures meeting the investment grade equivalent
criteria of our internal credit rating classification at June
30, 2024. In addition, 65% of the financial institutions
exposure is secured. For example, securities industry
clients and asset managers often borrow against marketable
securities held in custody. The exposure to financial
institutions is generally short term, with 84% expiring
within one year.

Wealth management loans

Wealth management loans are not typically rated by
external rating agencies. A majority of the wealth
management loans are secured by the customers’
investment management accounts or custody accounts.
Eligible assets pledged for these loans are typically
investment grade fixed-income securities, equities and/or
mutual funds. Internal ratings for this portion of the wealth
management loan portfolio, therefore, would equate to
investment grade external

68 BNY

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

ratings. Wealth management loans are provided to select
customers based on the pledge of other types of assets. For
the loans collateralized by other assets, the credit quality of
the obligor is carefully analyzed, but we do not consider
this portion of our wealth management loan portfolio to be
investment grade.

Wealth management mortgages

Credit quality indicators for wealth management mortgages
are not correlated to external ratings. Wealth management
mortgages are typically loans to high-net-worth
individuals, which are secured primarily by residential
property. These loans are primarily interest-only,
adjustable-rate mortgages with a weighted-average loan-to-
value ratio of 61% at origination. Delinquency rate is a key
indicator of credit quality in our wealth management
portfolio. At June 30, 2024, less than 1% of the mortgages
were past due.

At June 30, 2024, the wealth management mortgage
portfolio consisted of the following geographic
concentrations: California – 21%; New York – 14%;
Florida – 11%; Massachusetts – 8%; and other – 46%.

totaled $1.1 billion at June 30, 2024 and $1.2 billion at
Dec. 31, 2023. These loans are not typically correlated to
external ratings.

Capital call financing

Capital call financing includes loans to private equity funds
that are secured by the fund investors’ capital commitments
and the funds’ right to call capital.

Other loans

Other loans primarily include loans to consumers that are
fully collateralized with equities, mutual funds and fixed-
income securities.

Margin loans

We had $19.6 billion of secured margin loans at June 30,
2024, compared with $18.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.
Margin loans are collateralized with marketable securities,
and borrowers are required to maintain a daily collateral
margin in excess of 100% of the value of the loan. We have
rarely suffered a loss on these types of loans.

Lease financings

Overdrafts

At June 30, 2024, nearly all of the leasing exposure was
investment grade, or investment grade equivalent, and
consisted of exposures backed by well-diversified assets.
The largest components of our lease residual value
exposure relate to real estate and large-ticket transportation
equipment. Assets are both domestic and foreign-based,
with primary concentrations in Germany and the U.S.

Other residential mortgages

The other residential mortgages portfolio primarily consists
of 1-4 family residential mortgage loans and

Overdrafts primarily relate to custody and securities
clearance clients and totaled $3.2 billion at June 30, 2024
and $3.1 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. Overdrafts occur on a
daily basis and are generally repaid within two business
days.

Reverse repurchase agreements

Reverse repurchase agreements at June 30, 2024 and Dec.
31, 2023 were fully secured with high-quality collateral. As
a result, there was no allowance for credit losses related to
these assets at June 30, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023.

Tax credit investments

Tax credit investments include affordable housing projects
and renewable energy investments. We invest in affordable
housing projects primarily to satisfy the Company’s
requirements under the Community Reinvestment Act. On
Jan. 1, 2024, we adopted ASU 2023-02, Investments—
Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting
for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the
Proportional Amortization Method for our renewable
energy projects that met the eligibility criteria. See Note 2
for additional information.

Our tax credit investments totaled $2.2 billion at June 30,
2024 and $2.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. Commitments to
fund future investments totaled $846 million at June 30,
2024 and $780 million at Dec. 31, 2023 and are recorded
in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. A
summary of the commitments to fund future investments is
as follows: remainder of 2024 – $245 million; 2025 – $258
million; 2026 – $101 million; 2027 – $61 million; 2028 –
$66 million; and 2029 and thereafter – $115 million.

Tax credits and other tax benefits recognized were $115
million in the second quarter of 2024, $114 million in the
first quarter of 2024, $94 million in the second quarter of
2023, $229 million in the first six months of 2024 and
$184 million in the first six months of 2023.

Amortization expense included in the provision for income
taxes was $92 million in the second quarter of 2024, $92
million in the first quarter of 2024, $73 million in the
second quarter of 2023, $184 million in the first six months

Non-readily marketable equity securities

Non-readily marketable equity securities do not have
readily determinable fair values. These investments are
valued using a measurement alternative where the
investments are carried at cost, less any impairment, and
plus or minus changes resulting from observable price
changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar
investment of the same issuer. The observable price
changes are recorded in investment and other revenue on
the consolidated income statement. Our non-readily
marketable equity securities totaled $494 million at June
30, 2024 and $479 million at Dec. 31, 2023, and are
included in other equity investments in the table above.

Investments valued using net asset value (“NAV”) per
share

In our Investment and Wealth Management business
segment, we make seed capital investments in certain
funds we manage. We also hold private equity investments,
primarily small business investment companies (“SBICs”),
which are compliant with the

Volcker Rule, and certain other corporate investments.
Seed capital, private equity and other corporate
investments are included in other assets on the
consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of certain of
these investments was estimated using the NAV per share
for our ownership interest in the funds.

which have redemption notice periods of up to seven days, are liquidated.

(b)    Includes investments in funds that relate to deferred compensation arrangements with employees.
(c)    Private equity investments primarily include Volcker Rule-compliant investments in SBICs that invest in various sectors of the economy. Private equity
investments do not have redemption rights. Distributions from such investments will be received as the underlying investments in the private equity
investments, which have a life of 10 years, are liquidated.

Note 8–Contract revenue

Fee and other revenue in the Securities Services, Market
and Wealth Services and Investment and Wealth
Management business segments is primarily variable,
based on levels of assets under custody and/or
administration, assets under management and the level of
client-driven transactions, as specified in the fee schedules.
See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements in our 2023 Annual Report for information on
the nature of our services and revenue recognition. See
Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
in our 2023 Annual Report for additional information on
our principal business segments — Securities Services,

Market and Wealth Services and Investment and Wealth
Management — and the primary services provided.

Disaggregation of contract revenue

Contract revenue is included in fee and other revenue on
the consolidated income statement. The following tables
present fee and other revenue related to contracts with
customers, disaggregated by type of fee revenue, for each
business segment. Business segment data has been
determined on an internal management basis of accounting,
rather than GAAP, which is used for consolidated financial
reporting.

Contract balances

Our clients are billed based on fee schedules that are
agreed upon in each customer contract. Receivables from
customers were $2.6 billion at June 30, 2024 and Dec. 31,
2023.

Contract assets represent accrued revenues that have not
yet been billed to customers due to certain contractual
terms other than the passage of time and were $71 million
at June 30, 2024 and $27 million at Dec. 31, 2023. Accrued
revenues recorded as contract assets are usually billed on
an annual basis.

Both receivables from customers and contract assets are
included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.

Contract liabilities represent payments received in advance
of providing services under certain contracts and were
$225 million at June 30, 2024 and $172 million at Dec. 31,
2023. Contract liabilities are included in other liabilities on
the consolidated balance sheet. Revenue recognized in the
first six months of 2024 relating to contract liabilities as of
Dec. 31, 2023 was $85 million. Revenue recognized in the
second quarter of 2024 relating to contract liabilities as of
March 31, 2024 was $69 million.

Changes in contract assets and liabilities primarily relate to
either party’s performance under the contracts.

Contract costs

Incremental costs for obtaining contracts that are deemed
recoverable are capitalized as contract costs. Such costs
result from the payment of sales incentives, primarily in
the Wealth Management business, and totaled $49 million
at June 30, 2024 and $46 million at Dec. 31, 2023.
Capitalized sales incentives are amortized based on the
transfer of goods or services to which the assets relate. The
amortization of capitalized sales incentives, which is
included in staff expense on the consolidated income
statement, totaled $4 million in the second quarter of 2024,
$4 million in the second quarter of 2023, $3 million in the
first quarter of 2024, $7 million in the first six months of
2024 and $8 million in the first six months of 2023.

Costs to fulfill a contract are capitalized when they relate
directly to an existing contract or a specific anticipated
contract, generate or enhance resources that will be used to
fulfill performance obligations, and are recoverable. Such
costs generally represent set-up costs, which include any
direct cost incurred at the inception of a contract which
enables the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

BNY 75

fulfillment of the performance obligation, and totaled $93
million at June 30, 2024 and $90 million at Dec. 31, 2023.
These capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line
basis over the expected contract period.

Unsatisfied performance obligations

We do not have any unsatisfied performance obligations
other than those that are subject to a

Note 9–Net interest income

practical expedient election under ASC 606, Revenue From
Contracts With Customers. The practical expedient election
applies to (i) contracts with an original expected length of
one year or less, and (ii) contracts for which we recognize
revenue at the amount to which we have the right to
invoice for services performed.

The following table provides the components of net interest income presented on the consolidated income statement.

through 2016. Our New York State and New York City
income tax returns are closed to examination through 2014.
Our UK income tax returns are closed to examination
through 2020.

Note 12–Variable interest entities

We have variable interests in variable interest entities
(“VIEs”), which include investments in retail, institutional
and alternative investment funds.

We earn management fees from these funds, as well as
performance fees in certain funds, and may also provide
start-up capital for new funds. The funds are primarily
financed by our customers’ investments in the funds’ equity
or debt.

Additionally, we invest in qualified affordable housing and
renewable energy projects, which are designed to generate
a return primarily through the realization of tax credits.
The projects, which are structured as limited partnerships
and limited liability companies, are also VIEs, but are not
consolidated.

The following table presents the incremental assets and
liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet as of
June 30, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023. The net assets of any
consolidated VIE are solely available to settle the liabilities
of the VIE and to settle any

Note 11–Income taxes

BNY recorded an income tax provision of $357 million
(23.4% effective tax rate) in the second quarter of 2024,
$315 million (22.7% effective tax rate) in the second
quarter of 2023 and $297 million (22.4% effective tax rate)
in the first quarter of 2024.

In accordance with ASU 2023-02, Investments—Equity
Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for
Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the
Proportional Amortization Method, we elected to account
for investments in renewable energy projects that met the
eligibility requirement using the proportional amortization
method on a retrospective basis. Prior to 2024, we used the
hypothetical liquidation at book value (“HLBV”)
methodology to determine the pre-tax loss that is
recognized in each period. This change resulted in an
increase in investment and other revenue and an increase in
the provision for income taxes on the consolidated income
statement beginning in the first quarter of 2024. For
additional information, see Note 2 and Note 7.

Our total tax reserves as of June 30, 2024 were $107
million, compared with $109 million at Dec. 31, 2023. If
these tax reserves were unnecessary, $107 million would
affect the effective tax rate in future periods. We recognize
accrued interest and penalties, if applicable, related to
income taxes in income tax expense. Included in the
balance sheet at June 30, 2024 is accrued interest, where
applicable, of $36 million. The tax benefit related to
interest for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was $3
million, compared with $1 million of tax expense for the
six months ended June 30, 2023.

It is reasonably possible the total reserve for uncertain tax
positions could decrease within the next 12 months by
approximately $10 million as a result of

Note 15–Fair value measurement

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to
sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the
measurement date. A three-level hierarchy for fair value
measurements is utilized based upon the transparency of
inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the
measurement date. BNY’s own creditworthiness is
considered when valuing liabilities. See Note 20 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2023
Annual Report for

information on how we determine fair value and the fair
value hierarchy.

The following tables present the financial instruments
carried at fair value at June 30, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023, by
caption on the consolidated balance sheet and by the three-
level valuation hierarchy. We have included credit ratings
information in certain of the tables because the information
indicates the degree of credit risk to which we are exposed,
and significant changes in ratings classifications could
result in increased risk for us.

Under certain circumstances, we make adjustments to the fair value of our assets, liabilities and unfunded lending-related
commitments, although they are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis. The following table presents the carrying value
as of June 30, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023 of financial instruments for which nonrecurring adjustments to fair value have been
recorded during 2024 and/or 2023 and all non-readily marketable equity securities carried at cost with upward or downward
adjustments by balance sheet caption and level in the fair value hierarchy.

Note 16–Fair value option

Note 17–Derivative instruments

We elected fair value as an alternative measurement for
selected financial assets and liabilities that are not
otherwise required to be measured at fair value, including
the assets and liabilities of consolidated investment
management funds and subordinated notes associated with
certain equity investments.

We use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk,
including interest rate risk, equity price risk and foreign
currency risk, as well as credit risk. Our trading activities
are focused on acting as a market-maker for our customers
and facilitating customer trades in compliance with the
Volcker Rule.

The following table presents the assets and liabilities of
consolidated investment management funds, at fair value.

The assets and liabilities of the consolidated investment
management funds are included in other assets and other
liabilities, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheet.
We value the assets and liabilities of consolidated
investment management funds using quoted prices for
identical assets or liabilities in active markets or observable
inputs such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities.
Quoted prices for either identical or similar assets or
liabilities in inactive markets may also be used.
Accordingly, fair value best reflects the interests BNY
holds in the economic performance of the consolidated
investment management funds. Changes in the fair value of
the assets and liabilities are recorded as income (loss) from
consolidated investment management funds, which is
included in investment and other revenue on the
consolidated income statement.

We elected the fair value option on subordinated notes
associated with certain equity investments. The fair value
of these subordinated notes was $16 million at June 30,
2024 and $4 million at Dec. 31, 2023. The subordinated
notes were valued using observable market inputs and
included in Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.

The notional amounts for derivative financial instruments
express the dollar volume of the transactions; however,
credit risk is much smaller. We perform credit reviews and
enter into netting agreements and collateral arrangements
to minimize the credit risk of derivative financial
instruments. We enter into offsetting positions to reduce
exposure to foreign currency, interest rate and equity price
risk.

Use of derivative financial instruments involves reliance
on counterparties. Failure of a counterparty to honor its
obligation under a derivative contract is a risk we assume
whenever we engage in a derivative contract. There were
no counterparty default losses recorded in the second
quarter of 2024.

Hedging derivatives

We utilize interest rate swap agreements to manage our
exposure to interest rate fluctuations. We enter into fair
value hedges as an interest rate risk management strategy
to reduce fair value variability by converting certain fixed
rate interest payments associated with available-for-sale
securities, loans and long-term debt to floating interest
rates. We also utilize interest rate swaps and forward
exchange contracts as cash flow hedges to manage our
exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate
changes.

The available-for-sale securities hedged consist of U.S.
Treasury, agency and non-agency commercial MBS, non-
U.S. government and foreign covered bonds. At June 30,
2024, $34.3 billion par value of available-for-sale
securities was hedged with interest rate swaps designated
as fair value hedges that had notional values of $34.3
billion.

At June 30, 2024, $1.4 billion of interest rate swaps was
designated as portfolio layer method fair value hedges of
loans against a closed portfolio of fixed rate loans of
$3.3 billion, essentially converting $1.4 billion of such
fixed rate loans to a floating rate.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

BNY 85

The fixed rate long-term debt instruments hedged generally
have original maturities of five to 30 years. In fair value
hedging relationships, fixed rate debt is hedged with
“receive fixed rate, pay variable rate” swaps. At June 30,
2024, $22.9 billion par value of debt was hedged with
interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges that had
notional values of $22.9 billion.

From time to time, we have utilized forward foreign
exchange contracts as fair value hedges of the foreign
exchange risk associated with available-for-sale securities.
Forward points are designated as an excluded component
and amortized into earnings over the hedge period. At June
30, 2024, there were no remaining foreign exchange
contracts.

In addition, we utilize forward foreign exchange contracts
as hedges to mitigate foreign exchange exposures. We use
forward foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges to
convert certain forecasted non-U.S. dollar revenue and
expenses into U.S. dollars. We use forward foreign
exchange contracts with maturities of 15 months or less as
cash flow hedges to hedge our foreign exchange exposure
to currencies such as the Indian rupee, Polish zloty, Hong
Kong dollar, Singapore dollar, British pound and euro used
in revenue and expense transactions for entities that have
the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. As of June 30,
2024, the hedged forecasted foreign currency transactions
and designated forward foreign exchange contract hedges
were $741 million (notional), with a net pre-tax gain of $6
million recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
income (“OCI”). Over the next 12 months, a gain of $6
million will be reclassified into earnings.

Forward foreign exchange contracts are also used to hedge
the value of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
These forward foreign exchange contracts have maturities
of less than one year. The derivatives employed are
designated as hedges of changes in value of our foreign
investments due to exchange rates. The change in fair
market value of these forward foreign exchange contracts
is reported within foreign currency translation adjustments
in shareholders’ equity, net of tax. At June 30, 2024,
forward foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts
totaling $10.5 billion were designated as net investment
hedges.

From time to time, we also designate non-derivative
financial instruments as hedges of our net investments in
foreign subsidiaries. At June 30, 2024, there were no non-
derivative financial instruments hedging our net
investments in foreign subsidiaries.

Trading activities (including trading derivatives)

Our trading activities are focused on acting as a market-
maker for our customers, facilitating customer trades and
risk-mitigating economic hedging in compliance with the
Volcker Rule. The change in the fair value of the
derivatives utilized in our trading activities is recorded in
foreign exchange revenue and investment and other
revenue on the consolidated income statement.

and other trading revenue.

Foreign exchange revenue includes income from
purchasing and selling foreign currencies, currency
forwards, futures and options as well as foreign currency
remeasurement. Other trading revenue reflects results from
trading in cash instruments, including fixed income and
equity securities, and trading and economic hedging
activity with non-foreign exchange derivatives.

We also use derivative financial instruments as risk-
mitigating economic hedges, which are not formally
designated as accounting hedges. This includes hedging the
foreign currency, interest rate or market risks inherent in
some of our balance sheet exposures, such as seed capital
investments and deposits, as well as certain investment
management fee revenue streams. We also use total return
swaps to economically hedge obligations arising from the
Company’s deferred compensation plan whereby the
participants defer compensation and earn a return linked to
the performance of investments they select. The gains or
losses on these total return swaps are recorded in staff
expense on the consolidated income statement. There was
no impact in the second quarter of 2024. We recorded a
gain of $8 million in the second quarter of 2023, $11
million in the first quarter of 2024, $11 million in the first
six months of 2024 and $15 million in the first six months
of 2023.

We manage trading risk through a system of position
limits, a value-at-risk (“VaR”) methodology based on
historical simulation and other market sensitivity measures.
Risk is monitored and reported to senior

88 BNY

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

management by a separate unit, independent from trading,
on a daily basis. Based on certain assumptions, the VaR
methodology is designed to capture the potential overnight
pre-tax dollar loss from adverse changes in fair values of
all trading positions. The calculation assumes a one-day
holding period, utilizes a 99% confidence level and
incorporates non-linear product characteristics. The VaR
model is one of several statistical models used to develop
economic capital results, which are allocated to lines of
business for computing risk-adjusted performance.

VaR methodology does not evaluate risk attributable to
extraordinary financial, economic or other occurrences. As
a result, the risk assessment process includes a number of
stress scenarios based upon the risk factors in the portfolio
and management’s assessment of market conditions.
Additional stress scenarios based upon historical market
events are also performed. Stress tests may incorporate the
impact of reduced market liquidity and the breakdown of
historically observed correlations and extreme scenarios.
VaR and other statistical measures, stress testing and
sensitivity analysis are incorporated into other risk
management materials.

Counterparty credit risk and collateral

We assess the credit risk of our counterparties through
regular examination of their financial statements,
confidential communication with the management of those
counterparties and regular monitoring of publicly available
credit rating information. This and other information is
used to develop proprietary credit rating metrics used to
assess credit quality.

Collateral requirements are determined after a
comprehensive review of the credit quality of each
counterparty. Collateral is generally held or pledged in the
form of cash and/or highly liquid government securities.
Collateral requirements are monitored and adjusted daily.

Additional disclosures concerning derivative financial
instruments are provided in Note 15.

Disclosure of contingent features in over-the-counter
(“OTC”) derivative instruments

Certain OTC derivative contracts and/or collateral
agreements contain credit risk-contingent features
triggered upon a rating downgrade in which the

counterparty has the right to request additional collateral or
the right to terminate the contracts in a net liability
position.

The following table shows the aggregate fair value of OTC
derivative contracts in net liability positions that contained
credit risk-contingent features and the value of collateral
that has been posted.

BNY’s repurchase agreements and securities lending
transactions primarily encounter risk associated with
liquidity. We are required to pledge collateral based on
predetermined terms within the agreements. If we were to
experience a decline in the fair value of the collateral
pledged for these transactions, we could be required to
provide

additional collateral to the counterparty, therefore
decreasing the amount of assets available for other
liquidity needs that may arise. BNY also offers tri-party
collateral agency services in the tri-party repo market
where we are exposed to credit risk. In order to mitigate
this risk, we require dealers to fully secure intraday credit.

Note 18–Commitments and contingent liabilities

Off-balance sheet arrangements

In the normal course of business, various commitments and
contingent liabilities are outstanding that are not reflected
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Our significant trading and off-balance sheet risks are
securities, foreign currency and interest rate risk
management products, commercial lending commitments,
letters of credit and securities lending indemnifications. We
assume these risks to reduce interest rate and foreign
currency risks, to provide customers with the ability to
meet credit and liquidity needs and to hedge foreign
currency and interest rate risks. These items involve, to
varying degrees, credit, foreign currency and interest rate
risks not recognized on the balance sheet. Our off-balance
sheet risks are managed and monitored in manners similar
to those used for on-balance sheet risks.

The following table presents a summary of our off-balance
sheet credit risks.

The total potential loss on undrawn lending commitments,
standby and commercial letters of credit and securities
lending indemnifications is equal to the total notional
amount if drawn upon, which does not consider the value
of any collateral.

Since many of the lending commitments are expected to
expire without being drawn upon, the total amount does
not necessarily represent future cash requirements. A
summary of lending commitment

92 BNY

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

maturities is as follows: $31.2 billion in less than one year,
$18.5 billion in one to five years and $380 million over
five years.

SBLCs principally support obligations of corporate clients
and were collateralized with cash and securities of $179
million at June 30, 2024 and $158 million at Dec. 31,
2023. At June 30, 2024, $1.3 billion of the SBLCs will
expire within one year and $455 million in one to five
years. No SBLCs expire in over five years.

We must recognize, at the inception of an SBLC and
foreign and other guarantees, a liability for the fair value of
the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The fair
value of the liability, which was recorded with a
corresponding asset in other assets, was estimated as the
present value of contractual customer fees. The estimated
liability for losses related to SBLCs and foreign and other
guarantees, if any, is included in the allowance for lending-
related commitments.

Payment/performance risk of SBLCs is monitored using
both historical performance and internal ratings criteria.
BNY’s historical experience is that SBLCs typically expire
without being funded. SBLCs below investment grade are
monitored closely for payment/performance risk. The table
below shows SBLCs by investment grade:

Standby letters of credit

A commercial letter of credit is normally a short-term
instrument used to finance a commercial contract for the
shipment of goods from a seller to a buyer. Although the
commercial letter of credit is contingent upon the
satisfaction of specified conditions, it represents a credit
exposure if the buyer defaults on the underlying
transaction. As a result, the total contractual amounts do
not necessarily represent future cash requirements.
Commercial letters of credit totaled $41 million at June 30,
2024 and $41 million at Dec. 31, 2023.

We expect many of the lending commitments and letters of
credit to expire without the need to advance any cash. The
revenue associated with guarantees frequently depends on
the credit rating of the obligor and the structure of the
transaction, including

collateral, if any. The allowance for lending-related
commitments was $73 million at June 30, 2024 and $87
million at Dec. 31, 2023.

A securities lending transaction is a fully collateralized
transaction in which the owner of a security agrees to lend
the security (typically through an agent, in our case, The
Bank of New York Mellon) to a borrower, usually a broker-
dealer or bank, on an open, overnight or term basis, under
the terms of a prearranged contract.

We typically lend securities with indemnification against
borrower default. We generally require the borrower to
provide collateral with a minimum value of 102% of the
fair value of the securities borrowed, which is monitored
on a daily basis, thus reducing credit risk. Market risk can
also arise in securities lending transactions. These risks are
controlled through policies limiting the level of risk that
can be undertaken. Securities lending transactions are
generally entered into only with highly rated
counterparties. Securities lending indemnifications were
secured by collateral of $566 billion at June 30, 2024 and
$518 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.

CIBC Mellon, a joint venture between BNY and the
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (“CIBC”), engages
in securities lending activities.  CIBC Mellon, BNY and
CIBC jointly and severally indemnify securities lenders
against specific types of borrower default. At June 30,
2024 and Dec. 31, 2023, $66 billion and $59 billion,
respectively, of borrowings at CIBC Mellon, for which
BNY acts as agent on behalf of CIBC Mellon clients, were
secured by collateral of $70 billion and $62 billion,
respectively. If, upon a default, a borrower’s collateral was
not sufficient to cover its related obligations, certain losses
related to the indemnification could be covered by the
indemnitors.

Unsettled repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements

In the normal course of business, we enter into repurchase
agreements and reverse repurchase agreements that settle
at a future date. In repurchase agreements, BNY receives
cash from and provides securities as collateral to a
counterparty at settlement. In reverse repurchase
agreements, BNY advances cash to and receives securities
as collateral from the counterparty at settlement. These
transactions are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet
on the

settlement date. At June 30, 2024, we had no unsettled
repurchase agreements and $78.9 billion of unsettled
reverse repurchase agreements. At Dec. 31, 2023, we had
no unsettled repurchase agreements and $77.9 billion of
unsettled reverse repurchase agreements.

Industry concentrations

credit exposure at June 30, 2024. The tables below present

Sponsored member repo program

BNY is a sponsoring member in the FICC sponsored
member program, where we submit eligible repurchase and
reverse repurchase transactions in U.S. Treasury and
agency securities (“Sponsored Member Transactions”)
between BNY and our sponsored member clients for
novation and clearing through FICC pursuant to the FICC
Government Securities Division rulebook (the “FICC
Rules”). We also guarantee to FICC the prompt and full
payment and performance of our sponsored member
clients’ respective obligations under the FICC Rules in
connection with such clients’ Sponsored Member
Transactions. We minimize our credit exposure

BNY 93

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

under this guaranty by obtaining a security interest in our
sponsored member clients’ collateral and rights under
Sponsored Member Transactions. See “Offsetting assets
and liabilities” in Note 17 for additional information on our
repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements.

Indemnification arrangements

We have provided standard representations for
underwriting agreements, acquisition and divestiture
agreements, sales of loans and commitments, and other
similar types of arrangements and customary
indemnification for claims and legal proceedings related to
providing financial services that are not otherwise included
above. Insurance has been purchased to mitigate certain of
these risks. Generally, there are no stated or notional
amounts included in these indemnifications, and the
contingencies triggering the obligation for indemnification
are not expected to occur. Furthermore, often
counterparties to these transactions provide us with
comparable indemnifications. We are unable to develop an
estimate of the maximum payout under these
indemnifications for several reasons. In addition to the lack
of a stated or notional amount in a majority of such
indemnifications, we are unable to predict the nature of
events that would trigger indemnification or the level of
indemnification for a certain event. We believe, however,
that the possibility that we will have to make any material
payments for these indemnifications is remote. At June 30,
2024 and Dec. 31, 2023, we have not recorded any
material liabilities under these arrangements.

Clearing and settlement exchanges

We are a noncontrolling equity investor in, and/or member
of, several industry clearing or settlement exchanges
through which foreign exchange, securities, derivatives or
other transactions settle. Certain of these industry clearing
and settlement exchanges require their members to
guarantee their obligations and liabilities and/or to provide
liquidity support in the event other members do not honor
their obligations. We believe the likelihood that a clearing
or settlement exchange (of which we are a member) would
become insolvent is remote. Additionally, certain
settlement exchanges have implemented loss allocation
policies that enable the exchange to allocate settlement
losses to the members of the exchange. It is not possible to
quantify such mark-to-market loss until the loss occurs.
Any ancillary costs

94 BNY

that occur as a result of any mark-to-market loss cannot be
quantified. In addition, we also sponsor clients as members
on clearing and settlement exchanges and guarantee their
obligations. At June 30, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023, we did
not record any material liabilities under these
arrangements.

Legal proceedings

In the ordinary course of business, The Bank of New York
Mellon Corporation and its subsidiaries are routinely
named as defendants in or made parties to pending and
potential legal actions. We also are subject to governmental
and regulatory examinations, information-gathering
requests, investigations and proceedings (both formal and
informal). Claims for significant monetary damages are
often asserted in many of these legal actions, while claims
for disgorgement, restitution, penalties and/or other
remedial actions or sanctions may be sought in
governmental and regulatory matters. It is inherently
difficult to predict the eventual outcomes of such matters
given their complexity and the particular facts and
circumstances at issue in each of these matters. However,
on the basis of our current knowledge and understanding,
we do not believe that judgments, settlements or orders, if
any, arising from these matters (either individually or in the
aggregate, after giving effect to applicable reserves and
insurance coverage) will have a material adverse effect on
the consolidated financial position or liquidity of BNY,
although they could have a material effect on our results of
operations in a given period.

In view of the inherent unpredictability of outcomes in
litigation and regulatory matters, particularly where (i) the
damages sought are substantial or indeterminate, (ii) the
proceedings are in the early stages, or (iii) the matters
involve novel legal theories or a large number of parties, as
a matter of course there is considerable uncertainty
surrounding the timing or ultimate resolution of litigation
and regulatory matters, including a possible eventual loss,
fine, penalty or business impact, if any, associated with
each such matter. In accordance with applicable accounting
guidance, we establish accruals for litigation and
regulatory matters when those matters proceed to a stage
where they present loss contingencies that are both
probable and reasonably estimable. In such cases, there
may be a possible exposure to loss in excess of any
amounts accrued. We regularly monitor such matters for
developments that could affect the amount of the accrual,
and will

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

adjust the accrual amount as appropriate. If the loss
contingency in question is not both probable and
reasonably estimable, we do not establish an accrual and
the matter continues to be monitored for any developments
that would make the loss contingency both probable and
reasonably estimable. We believe that our accruals for legal
proceedings are appropriate and, in the aggregate, are not
material to the consolidated financial position of BNY,
although future accruals could have a material effect on the
results of operations in a given period. In addition, if we
have the potential to recover a portion of an estimated loss
from a third party, we record a receivable up to the amount
of the accrual that is probable of recovery.

For certain of those matters described here for which a loss
contingency may, in the future, be reasonably possible
(whether in excess of a related accrued liability or where
there is no accrued liability), BNY is currently unable to
estimate a range of reasonably possible loss. For those
matters described here where BNY is able to estimate a
reasonably possible loss, the aggregate range of such
reasonably possible loss is up to $600 million in excess of
the accrued liability (if any) related to those matters. For
matters where a reasonably possible loss is denominated in
a foreign currency, our estimate is adjusted quarterly based
on prevailing exchange rates. We do not consider potential
recoveries when estimating reasonably possible losses.

The following describes certain judicial, regulatory and
arbitration proceedings involving BNY:

Mortgage-Securitization Trusts Proceedings
BNY has been named as a defendant in a number of legal
actions brought by MBS investors alleging that the trustee
has expansive duties under the governing agreements,
including the duty to investigate and pursue breach of
representation and warranty claims against other parties to
the MBS transactions. Two actions commenced in
December 2015 and February 2017 are pending in New
York federal court. In New York state court, six actions are
pending: one case commenced in May 2016; two related
cases commenced in September 2021 and October 2022;
and three related cases commenced in October 2021,
December 2021 and February 2022.

Matters Related to R. Allen Stanford
In late December 2005, Pershing LLC (“Pershing”)
became a clearing firm for Stanford Group Co.

(“SGC”), a registered broker-dealer that was part of a
group of entities ultimately controlled by R. Allen Stanford
(“Stanford”). Stanford International Bank, also controlled
by Stanford, issued certificates of deposit (“CDs”). Some
investors allegedly wired funds from their SGC accounts to
purchase CDs. In 2009, the Securities and Exchange
Commission charged Stanford with operating a Ponzi
scheme in connection with the sale of CDs, and SGC was
placed into receivership. Alleged purchasers of CDs have
filed two putative class action proceedings against
Pershing: one in November 2009 in Texas federal court,
and one in May 2016 in New Jersey federal court. On Nov.
5, 2021, the court dismissed the class action filed in New
Jersey and that matter has concluded. Three lawsuits
remain against Pershing in Louisiana and New Jersey
federal courts, which were filed in January 2010, October
2015 and May 2016. The purchasers allege that Pershing,
as SGC’s clearing firm, assisted Stanford in a fraudulent
scheme and assert contractual, statutory and common law
claims. In March 2019, a group of investors filed a putative
class action against The Bank of New York Mellon in New
Jersey federal court, making the same allegations as in the
prior actions brought against Pershing. On Nov. 12, 2021,
the court dismissed the class action against The Bank of
New York Mellon; on Dec. 15, 2022, an appeals court
reversed the dismissal and returned the case to the trial
court for further proceedings. All the cases that have been
brought in federal court have been consolidated in Texas
federal court for discovery purposes. On June 28, 2024, an
unincorporated association that claims to represent the
interests of Stanford investors filed a lawsuit in New Jersey
federal court against The Bank of New York Mellon,
making the same allegations as prior cases, and we expect
that lawsuit to be consolidated with the others in Texas
federal court. Various alleged Stanford CD purchasers
asserted similar claims in Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”) arbitration proceedings.

Brazilian Postalis Litigation
BNY Servicos Financeiros DTVM S.A. (“DTVM”), a
subsidiary that provides asset services in Brazil, acts as
administrator for certain investment funds in which a
public pension fund for postal workers called Postalis-
Instituto de Seguridade Social dos Correios e Telégrafos
(“Postalis”) invested. On Aug. 22, 2014, Postalis sued
DTVM in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil for losses related to a
Postalis fund for which DTVM is administrator. Postalis
alleges that DTVM failed to properly perform duties,
including to conduct due

BNY 95

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

diligence of and exert control over the manager. On March
12, 2015, Postalis filed a lawsuit in Rio de Janeiro against
DTVM and BNY Administração de Ativos Ltda.
(“Ativos”) alleging failure to properly perform duties
relating to another fund of which DTVM is administrator
and Ativos is manager. On Dec. 14, 2015, Associacão dos
Profissionais dos Correios (“ADCAP”), a Brazilian postal
workers association, filed a lawsuit in São Paulo against
DTVM and other defendants alleging that DTVM
improperly contributed to Postalis investment losses. On
March 20, 2017, the lawsuit was dismissed without
prejudice, and ADCAP appealed. On Aug. 4, 2021, the
appellate court overturned the dismissal and sent the
lawsuit to a state lower court. On March 2, 2023, DTVM
appealed the August 4 decision to Brazil’s Superior Court
of Justice. On Dec. 17, 2015, Postalis filed three lawsuits
in Rio de Janeiro against DTVM and Ativos alleging
failure to properly perform duties with respect to
investments in several other funds. On May 20, 2021, the
court in one of those lawsuits entered a judgment of
approximately $3 million against DTVM and Ativos. On
Aug. 23, 2021, DTVM and Ativos filed an appeal of the
May 20 decision. On June 7, 2022, the appellate court
partially granted and partially denied the appeal, reducing
the judgment to approximately $2 million. On July 13,
2023, DTVM and Ativos filed a further appeal to Brazil’s
Superior Court of Justice. On Aug. 24, 2022, the court
dismissed one of the other lawsuits. On Nov. 24, 2022,
Postalis appealed that decision. On Oct. 24, 2023,
Postalis’s appeal was denied. Postalis further appealed on
June 27, 2024. On Feb. 4, 2016, Postalis filed a lawsuit in
Brasilia against DTVM, Ativos and BNY Alocação de
Patrimônio Ltda. (“Alocação de Patrimônio”), an
investment management subsidiary, alleging failure to
properly perform duties and liability for losses with respect
to investments in various funds of which the defendants
were administrator and/or manager. On Jan. 16, 2018, the
Brazilian Federal Prosecution Service filed a civil lawsuit
in São Paulo against DTVM alleging liability for Postalis
losses based on alleged failures to properly perform certain
duties as administrator to certain funds in which Postalis
invested or as controller of Postalis’s own investment
portfolio. On April 18, 2018, the court dismissed the
lawsuit without prejudice. On Aug. 4, 2021, the appellate
court overturned the dismissal and returned the lawsuit to
the lower court. On April 11, 2022, DTVM appealed the
Aug. 4 decision to Brazil’s Superior Court of Justice. On
Aug. 21, 2023, DTVM’s appeal was denied. In addition,
the

96 BNY

Tribunal de Contas da União (“TCU”), an administrative
tribunal, has initiated proceedings with the purpose of
determining liability for losses to four investment funds
administered by DTVM in which Postalis was an investor.
On Sept. 9, 2020, TCU rendered a decision in one of the
proceedings, finding DTVM and two former Postalis
directors jointly and severally liable for approximately $50
million. TCU also imposed on DTVM a fine of
approximately $2 million. DTVM’s administrative appeal
of the decision was denied. On Feb. 25, 2022, DTVM filed
a lawsuit in Brazil federal court in Brasilia seeking
annulment of TCU’s decision and an injunction preventing
TCU from enforcing the judgment. On Aug. 24, 2022, the
Brazilian Federal Attorneys filed an action in Rio de
Janeiro court seeking to enforce the fine portion of the
judgment. On Nov. 8, 2022, the Brasilia federal court in the
annulment action granted DTVM’s request for an
injunction, suspending the Sept. 9, 2020 TCU decision
until the annulment action is decided. On Oct. 4, 2019,
Postalis and another pension fund filed a request for
arbitration in São Paulo against DTVM and Ativos alleging
liability for losses to an investment fund for which DTVM
was administrator and Ativos was manager. On March 26,
2021, DTVM and Ativos filed a lawsuit in São Paulo
challenging the decision rendered by the Arbitration Court
with respect to its jurisdiction over the case. On Feb. 24,
2023, the São Paulo court annulled the Arbitration Court’s
decision that it had jurisdiction, and Postalis and the other
pension fund have appealed. On Sept. 21, 2023, the São
Paulo court issued an order suspending the arbitration; the
Arbitration Court implemented the suspension on Oct. 6,
2023. On April 8, 2024, the appellate court reversed the
São Paulo court’s decision and found that the Arbitration
Court did have jurisdiction. DTVM plans to further appeal.
On Oct. 25, 2019, Postalis filed a lawsuit in Rio de Janeiro
against DTVM and Alocação de Patrimônio, alleging
liability for losses in another fund for which DTVM was
administrator and Alocação de Patrimônio and Ativos were
managers. On May 9, 2022, the court found DTVM and
Alocação de Patrimônio jointly and severally liable for
approximately $20 million. On Aug. 12, 2022, DTVM and
Alocação de Patrimônio appealed the decision. On April
30, 2024, the appeals court reversed the finding against
DTVM and Alocação de Patrimônio. Postalis has further
appealed that reversal. On June 19, 2020, a lawsuit was
filed in federal court in Rio de Janeiro against DTVM,
Postalis, and various other defendants alleging

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

liability against DTVM for certain Postalis losses in an
investment fund of which DTVM was administrator. On
Feb. 10, 2021, Postalis and another pension fund served
DTVM in a lawsuit filed in Rio de Janeiro, alleging
liability for losses in another investment fund for which
DTVM was administrator and the other defendant was
manager.

Brazilian Silverado Litigation
DTVM acts as administrator for the Fundo de Investimento
em Direitos Creditórios Multisetorial Silverado Maximum
(“Silverado Maximum Fund”), which invests in
commercial credit receivables. On June 2, 2016, the
Silverado Maximum Fund sued DTVM in its capacity as
administrator, along with Deutsche Bank S.A. - Banco
Alemão in its capacity as custodian and Silverado Gestão e
Investimentos Ltda. in its capacity as investment manager.
The Fund alleges that each of the defendants failed to
fulfill its respective duty, and caused losses to the Fund for
which the defendants are jointly and severally liable. On
March 21, 2024, the São Paulo court issued a decision
finding DTVM, Deutsche Bank and Silverado Gestão e
Investimentos jointly liable for losses to the Fund in an
amount to be determined during a later calculation phase.
DTVM plans to appeal.

German Tax Matters
German authorities are investigating past “cum/ex”
trading, which involved the purchase of equity securities
on or shortly before the dividend date, but settled after that
date, potentially resulting in an unwarranted refund of
withholding tax. German authorities have taken the view
that past cum/ex trading may have resulted in tax
avoidance or evasion. European subsidiaries of BNY have
been informed by German authorities about investigations
into potential cum/ex trading by certain third-party
investment funds, where one of the subsidiaries had
acquired entities that served as depositary and/or fund
manager for those third-party investment funds. We have
received information requests from the authorities relating
to pre-acquisition activity and are cooperating fully with
those requests. In August 2019, the District Court of Bonn
ordered that one of these subsidiaries be joined as a
secondary party in connection with the prosecution of
unrelated individual defendants. Trial commenced in
September 2019. In March 2020, the court stated that it
would refrain from taking action against the subsidiary in
order to expedite the conclusion of the trial. The court
convicted the unrelated individual

defendants, and determined that the cum/ex trading
activities of the relevant third-party investment funds were
unlawful. In November and December 2020 and February
2023, we received secondary liability notices from the
German tax authorities totaling approximately $150
million (at then-prevailing exchange rates) related to pre-
acquisition activity in various funds for which the entities
we acquired were depositary and/or fund manager. We
have appealed the notices. In connection with the
acquisition of the subject entities, we obtained an
indemnity for liabilities from the sellers that we intend to
pursue as necessary.

Off-Channel Business-Related Communications
The Company has been responding to a request for
information from the SEC concerning compliance with
recordkeeping obligations relating to business
communications transmitted on unapproved electronic
communication platforms. SEC Staff has stated that it is
conducting similar inquiries into recordkeeping practices at
other financial institutions. The Company is in advanced
discussions with the SEC to resolve this investigation. In
April 2023, the Company received a similar request from
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and is
cooperating with that inquiry.

Pershing Rule 15c3-3 Matter
The Company has been responding to investigative
requests for information and records from the SEC
concerning Pershing LLC’s compliance with its obligations
under SEC Rule 15c3-3, among other regulatory rules and
statutes. The Company continues to cooperate with the
inquiry.

Note 19–Business segments

We have an internal information system that produces
performance data along product and service lines for our
three principal business segments and the Other segment.
The primary products and services and types of revenue for
our principal businesses and a description of the Other
segment are presented in Note 24 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2023 Annual
Report.

Business accounting principles

Our business data has been determined on an internal
management basis of accounting, rather than GAAP, which
is used for consolidated financial reporting. These
measurement principles are designed so that

BNY 97

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

reported results of the businesses will track their economic
performance.

Business segment results are subject to reclassification
when organizational changes are made, or for refinements
in revenue and expense allocation methodologies.
Refinements are typically reflected on a prospective basis.
There were no reclassifications or organizational changes
in the second quarter of 2024. In the first quarter of 2024,
we made certain realignments of similar products and
services within our lines of business. The largest change
was the movement of Institutional Solutions from Pershing
to Clearance and Collateral Management, both in the
Market and Wealth Services business segment. We made
other smaller changes that moved activity from Asset
Servicing in the Securities Services business segment to
Treasury Services in the Market and Wealth Services
business segment, and from Wealth Management in the
Investment and Wealth Management business segment and
Pershing in the Market and Wealth Services business
segment to Investment Management in the Investment and
Wealth Management business segment. The Other segment
was not impacted by the changes. Business segment results
for the three- and six-months ended June 30, 2023 have
been revised to reflect these changes.

The accounting policies of the businesses are the same as
those described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements in our 2023 Annual Report.

The results of our business segments are presented and
analyzed on an internal management reporting basis.

• Revenue amounts reflect fee and other revenue

generated by each business and include revenue for
services provided between the segments that are also
provided to third parties. Fee and other revenue
transferred between businesses under revenue transfer
agreements is included within other fees in each
segment.

• Revenues and expenses associated with specific client
bases are included in those businesses. For example,
foreign exchange activity associated with clients using
custody products is included in the Securities Services
segment.

98 BNY

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

• Net interest income is allocated to businesses based on
the yields on the assets and liabilities generated by each
business. We employ a funds transfer pricing system
that matches funds with the specific assets and liabilities
of each business based on their interest sensitivity and
maturity characteristics.

•

•

•

The provision for credit losses associated with the
respective credit portfolios is reflected in each segment.

Incentives expense related to restricted stock and
restricted stock units is allocated to the segments.

Support and other indirect expenses, including services
provided between segments that are not provided to
third parties or not subject to a revenue transfer
agreement, are allocated to the businesses based on
internally developed methodologies and reflected in
noninterest expense.

• Recurring FDIC expense is allocated to the businesses
based on average deposits generated within each
business.

•

•

Severance expense is recorded in the segments based on
the business or function the impacted employees reside,
with severance related to corporate staff, technology
and operations reflected in the Other segment.

Litigation expense is generally recorded in the business
in which the charge occurs.

• Management of the securities portfolio is a shared

service contained in the Other segment. As a result,
gains and losses associated with the valuation of the
securities portfolio are generally included in the Other
segment.

• Client deposits serve as the primary funding source for

our securities portfolio. We typically allocate all interest
income to the businesses generating the deposits.

• Balance sheet assets and liabilities and their related
income or expense are specifically assigned to each
business. Segments with a net liability position have
been allocated assets.

• Goodwill and intangible assets are reflected within

individual businesses.

The following consolidating schedules present the contribution of our segments to our overall profitability.
