item risk factors we are subject to numerous risks many of which are inherent to our business as a financial services organization we must balance revenue generation and profitability with the risks associated with our business activities for information about how our risk oversight and management process operates see item of this report mda risk management the following discussion highlights specific risks that could affect us and our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows based on the information currently known we believe that the following information identifies the material risk factors affecting us the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those described below additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all the other information set forth in this report if any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events or if the circumstances described in the risks and uncertainties occur or continue to occur these events or circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows these events could also have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities credit risk our results of operations are significantly affected by the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans lending money is an essential part of the banking business however for various reasons borrowers do not always repay their loans the risk of nonpayment is affected by credit risks of a particular borrower changes in economic conditions that impact certain geographic markets or industries fluctuations in interest rates on adjustablerate loans the duration of the loan and in the case of a collateralized loan uncertainties as to the future value of the collateral generally commercial loans and leases present a greater risk of nonpayment by a borrower than other types of loans they typically involve larger loan balances and are particularly sensitive to economic conditions the borrowers ability to repay usually depends on the successful operation of its business and income stream some of our commercial borrowers have multiple loans outstanding with us which means that an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss in the case of commercial and industrial loans collateral often consists of accounts receivable inventory property and equipment which may not yield substantial recovery of principal losses incurred and is susceptible to deterioration declining valuations or other losses in advance of liquidation of such collateral consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrowers continuing financial stability and thus are more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances furthermore the application of various federal and state laws may limit the amount that can be recovered on these loans for additional information see the lending activity section of mda which is included in item of this report our mortgage banking profitability could be significantly reduced if we are not able to originate and resell a high volume of mortgage loans mortgage banking is generally considered a volatile source of income because it depends largely on the volume of loans we originate and sell in the secondary market if our originations of mortgage loans decrease resulting in fewer loans that are available to be sold to investors this would result in a decrease in mortgage revenues and a corresponding decrease in noninterest income mortgage loan production levels are sensitive to changes in economic conditions and activity strengths or weaknesses in the housing market changes in frb monetary policies interest rate fluctuations and the availability of an active secondary market or originations that could shift to adjustablerate products which may be held in the portfolio generally any sustained period of decreased economic activity or higher interest rates could reduce demand for mortgage loans and refinancings while conversely any sustained period of increased economic activity and decreasing interest rates could increase the demand for mortgage loans and loan repayments in addition our results of operations are affected by the amount of noninterest expense associated with mortgage banking activities such as salaries commissions and employee benefits occupancy equipment and data processing expense and other operating costs during periods of reduced loan demand our results of operations may be adversely affected to the extent that we are unable to reduce expenses commensurate with the decline in loan originations future changes to our eligibility to participate in the programs offered by the governmentsponsored entities gses and other secondary purchasers or the loan criteria of the gses and other secondary purchasers could also result in a lower volume of corresponding loan originations and sales the estimates of revenues produced by the models we use to assess the impact of interest rates on mortgagerelated revenues are dependent on estimates and assumptions of future loan demand prepayment speeds and other factors which may differ from actual subsequent experience our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we must further increase our provision for credit losses or if our acl is not sufficient to absorb actual losses there is no precise method of predicting loan losses we can give no assurance that our acl will be sufficient to absorb actual loan losses excess loan losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations the level of the acl reflects the judgment and estimates of management regarding the amount and timing of future cash flows current fair value of the underlying collateral and other qualitative risk factors that may affect the loan determination of the allowance is inherently subjective and is based on factors that are susceptible to significant change continuing deterioration in economic conditions affecting borrowers new information regarding existing loans suspected fraud identification of additional problem loans and other factors both within and outside of our control may require an increase in the acl in addition bank regulatory agencies periodically review our acl and may require an increase in the provision for credit losses or the recognition of additional loan chargeoffs based on judgments different from those of management in addition if chargeoffs in future periods exceed the acl we will need additional provisions to increase the acl any increases in the acl will result in a decrease in net income and capital and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations for additional discussion relating to this matter refer to the allowance and provision for credit losses section of mda which is included in item of this report market risk our business and financial performance is impacted significantly by market interest rates and changes in those rates the monetary tax and other policies of governmental agencies including the ust and the frb have a direct impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance over which we have no control and which may not be able to be predicted with reasonable accuracy as a result of the high percentage of our assets and liabilities that are in the form of interestbearing or interestrelated instruments changes in interest rates in the shape of the yield curve or in spreads between different market interest rates can have a material effect on our business profitability and the value of our financial assets and liabilities such scenarios may include the following changes in interest rates or interest rate spreads can affect the difference between the interest earned on assets and the interest paid on liabilities which impacts fnbpas overall net interest income and profitability such changes can affect the ability of borrowers to meet obligations under variable or adjustablerate loans and other debt instruments and can in turn affect our loss rates on those assets such changes may decrease the demand for interest ratebased products or services including bank loans and deposit products and the subordinated notes offered by our subsidiary fnb financial services lp such changes can also affect our ability to hedge various forms of market and interest rate risks and may decrease the profitability or increase the risk associated with such hedges and movements in interest rates also affect mortgage repayment speeds and could result in impairments of msas or otherwise affect the profitability of such assets the monetary tax and other policies of the us government and its agencies also have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance the frb regulates the national supply of bank credit and certain interest rates through the implementation of certain monetary policies and actions due to elevated levels of inflation and corresponding pressure to raise interest rates the frb announced in january that it would be slowing the pace of its bond purchasing and increasing the target range for the federal funds rate over time which it did from march to july the fomc has since paused increases to the target federal funds rate although economists are projecting that the target funds rate will likely decline in small periodic increments the timing extent and frequency of such reductions remain uncertain changes in monetary policy including changes in interest rates could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and investments and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings but such changes could also affect i our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits ii the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities and iii the average duration of our mortgage portfolio and other interestearning assets if the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments our net interest income and therefore earnings could be adversely affected earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings interest rate risk may also result from timing differences in the maturity and repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities changes in the shape of the yield curve hedging activity and the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options any substantial unexpected prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and any related economic downturn especially domestically and in the regions in which we operate may adversely affect our asset quality deposit levels loan demand and results of operations also our interest rate risk modeling techniques and assumptions likely may not fully predict or capture the impact of actual or future interest rate changes on our balance sheet changes in interest rates could reduce the value of our afs securities holdings which would increase our accumulated other comprehensive loss and thereby negatively impact stockholders equity we maintain an investment portfolio consisting of various highquality liquid fixedincome securities the total carrying value of the afs securities portfolio as of december was billion and the estimated duration of the portfolio was approximately years the nature of fixedincome securities is such that changes in market interest rates impact the value of these assets based on the duration of our afs securities portfolio a one percent increase or decrease in market rates is projected to positively or negatively impact the market value of the afs securities portfolio by approximately million increases or decreases in market interest rates are expected to further increase or decrease our aoci loss and thereby decrease stockholders equity further the frb and the occ may consider increases in aoci when evaluating our regulatory capital position although current capital regulations permit aoci to be excluded from capital for institutions of our size liquidity risk liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and meet our obligations as they become due our ability to implement our business strategy will depend on our liquidity and ability to obtain funding for loan originations working capital and other general purposes liquidity is needed to fund various obligations including credit commitments to borrowers mortgage and other loan originations withdrawals by depositors repayment of borrowings dividends to shareholders operating expenses and capital expenditures liquidity risk is the potential that we will be unable to meet our obligations as they come due capitalize on growth opportunities as they arise or pay regular dividends on our common stock because of illiquid assets or an inability to obtain satisfactory funding our preferred sources for funding are deposits and customer repurchase agreements which are low cost and stable sources of funding for us we compete with commercial banks savings banks and credit unions as well as numerous nondepository competitors for deposits and customer repurchase agreements if a significant portion of our deposits were to be withdrawn within a short period of time or if we are unable to attract and maintain sufficient levels of deposits and customer repurchase agreements to fund our loan growth and liquidity objectives we may be subject to paying higher funding costs by raising interest rates that are paid on deposits and customer repurchase agreements or cause us to source funds from thirdparty providers which may be higher cost funding impacting our net interest margin and overall profitability additionally our ability to attract depositors during a time of actual or perceived distress or instability in the marketplace may be limited because our afs investment securities lose value when interest rates rise aftertax proceeds resulting from the sale of such assets may be diminished during periods when interest rates are elevated however the sale of all or a material portion of our securities portfolio to increase liquidity in the face of withdrawals would cause the realization of significant losses that would in turn reduce our regulatory capital position our growth may require us to raise additional capital in the future but that capital may not be available when it is needed we are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations see discussion under government supervision and regulation included in item of this report as a financial holding company we seek to maintain capital sufficient to meet the wellcapitalized standard set by regulators while we anticipate that our current capital resources will satisfy our capital requirements for the foreseeable future we may at some point need to raise additional capital to support current operations or continued growth the availability of additional capital or financing will depend on a variety of factors many of which are outside of our control including market conditions credit availability our credit ratings and credit capacity marketability of our stock and the possibility that lenders and investors could develop a negative perception of our long or shortterm financial prospects if we incur large credit losses or if the level of business activity decreases due to economic conditions accordingly there can be no assurance of our ability to expand our operations through organic growth or acquisitions as such we may be forced to delay raising capital issue shorterterm securities than desired or bear an unattractive cost of capital which could decrease profitability and significantly reduce financial flexibility in addition if we decide to raise additional equity capital it could be dilutive to our existing stockholders we are dependent on dividends from our subsidiaries to meet our financial obligations and pay dividends to stockholders we are a holding company and conduct almost all our operations through our subsidiaries we do not have any significant assets other than cash and the stock of our subsidiaries accordingly we depend on dividends from our subsidiaries in particular fnbpa to meet our financial obligations and to pay dividends to stockholders our right to participate in any distribution of earnings or assets of our subsidiaries is subject to the prior claims of creditors of such subsidiaries under federal law the amount of dividends that a national bank such as fnbpa may pay in a calendar year is dependent on the amount of our net income for the current year combined with our retained net income for the two preceding years the occ has the authority to prohibit fnbpa from paying dividends if it determines such payment would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice likewise our statebased entities are subject to state laws governing dividend practices and payments regulatory authorities may restrict our ability to pay dividends on and make repurchases of our common stock dividends on our common stock will be payable only if when and as authorized and declared by our board of directors however our ability to pay dividends and make stock repurchases may be limited due to banking laws and regulations and limitations imposed by our banking regulators including occ limiting dividends from fnbpa in certain circumstances we will not be able to make a capital distribution unless the frb approves such distribution including if the dividend could not be fully funded by our net income over the last four quarters net of dividends paid our prospective rate of earnings retention appears inconsistent with our capital needs asset quality and overall financial condition or we will not be able to continue meeting the minimum required capital ratios as a bank holding company we also are required to consult with the frb before increasing dividends or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments additionally the frb could prohibit or limit our payment of dividends if it determines that payment of the dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice there can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends or repurchase any shares of our common stock in the future we have outstanding securities senior to common stock which could limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock we have outstanding tps that are senior to our common stock and could adversely affect our ability to declare or pay dividends or distributions on our common stock the terms of the tps prohibit us from declaring or paying dividends or making distributions on our junior capital stock including the common stock or purchasing acquiring or making a liquidation payment on any junior capital stock if an event of default has occurred and is continuing under the junior subordinated debentures underlying the tps we are in default with respect to a guarantee payment under the guarantee of the related tps or we have given notice of our election to defer interest payments but the related deferral period has not yet commenced or a deferral period is continuing if we experience a material deterioration in our financial condition liquidity capital results of operations or risk profile our regulators may not permit us to make future payments on our tps which would also prevent us from paying any dividends on our common stock reputation risk our key assets include our brand and reputation and our business may be affected by how we are perceived by the public our brand and our reputation are our key assets our ability to attract and retain banking insurance wealth management and corporate clients and employees is highly dependent upon external perceptions of our culture level of service security trustworthiness business practices and financial condition negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters could damage our reputation among existing customers and corporate clients and employees which could make it difficult for us to attract new clients and employees and retain existing ones adverse developments with respect to our financial services activities the financial services industry or sociopolitical events and circumstances may also by association negatively impact our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us although we monitor developments for areas of potential risk to our reputation and brand negative perceptions or publicity could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability we are subject to environmental social and governance esg risks that could adversely affect our reputation and the market price of our securities we are subject to a variety of risks arising from esg matters esg matters include climate risk hiring practices the diversity of our work force and equitable treatment of our employees customers and third parties with whom we otherwise do business risks arising from esg matters including shifts in investor approaches related to esg may adversely affect among other things our reputation and the market price of our securities further we may be exposed to negative publicity eg traditional and social media based on the identity and activities of those to whom we lend and with which we otherwise do business and the publics view of the approach and performance of our customers and business partners with respect to esg matters such negative publicity could adversely impact our relationships and reputation with our existing and prospective customers and potentially have an adverse effect on our ability to attract and retain customers and employees and could have a negative impact on the market price for our securities investors may consider the steps taken and resources allocated by financial institutions and other commercial organizations to address esg matters when making investment decisions certain investors have incorporated the business risks of climate change and the adequacy of companies responses to the risks posed by climate change into their investment theses increased attention to esg matters also has caused public officials including certain state attorneys general treasurers and legislators to take various actions to impact the extent to which esg principles are considered by private investors including actions to limit business with government entities or the initiation of an investigation or enforcement action because of what is perceived to be depending on the governmental authority either our unwarranted focus or lack of focus on esg matters operational risk our failure to continue to recruit and retain qualified banking professionals could adversely affect our ability to compete successfully and affect our profitability our continued success and future growth depend heavily on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled diverse and motivated banking professionals we compete against many institutions with greater financial resources both within our industry and in other industries to attract these qualified individuals our failure to recruit and retain adequate talent could reduce our ability to compete successfully and adversely affect our business and profitability the financial soundness of other financial institutions may adversely affect fnb fnbpa and other affiliates financial institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty and other relationships fnb fnbpa and other affiliates are exposed to many different industries and counterparties and they routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks and other institutional clients many of these types of transactions expose fnb fnbpa and other affiliates to credit risk in the event of default of the counterparty or client in addition fnbpa and other affiliates credit risks may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure that we are due we are subject to operational risk that could damage our reputation and our business we engage in a variety of businesses and rely on systems employees service providers and counterparties to properly process a high volume of transactions like all businesses we are subject to operational risk which represents the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes in our systems human error and external events operational risk also encompasses technology compliance and legal risk many strategic initiatives including those related to products staffing and business processes could substantially increase operational risk we are also exposed to operational risk through our outsourcing arrangements and the effect the changes in circumstances or capabilities of our outsourcing vendors can have on our ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to our business external and internal risk has proliferated in recent years the shift in recent years to digital mobile and online platforms have resulted in a large volume of payment transactions being executed more quickly leaving banks less time to identify and counteract fraud and recover the funds misappropriated by fraudulent actors moreover the level of sophistication of fraud has increased in part due to greater collaboration among bad actors including the exchange of stolen data new techniques and expertise available on the dark web the financial services industry is continually developing and forcing countermeasures to prevent detect and remediate the evershifting fraud landscape and the ability to quickly adapt to new threats is a critical element of fraud prevention changes and instability in economic conditions and financial markets including a contraction of economic activity could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition our financial performance depends to a certain extent upon global domestic and local economic and political conditions as well as governmental monetary policies conditions such as changes in interest rates money supply levels of employment and other factors beyond our control may have a negative impact on economic activity any contraction of economic activity including an economic recession or an inflationary environment may adversely affect our asset quality deposit levels and loan demand and therefore our earnings in particular interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control including global domestic and local economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and specifically the frb throughout and the fomc raised the target range for the federal funds rate on separate occasions citing economic and geopolitical disruptions and signaled that current frb direction is to begin lowering rates at some point during as inflation returns to more normalized levels financial institutions also face a comparatively heightened credit risk of note because we have a significant amount of real estate loans decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral which in turn can adversely affect the value of our loan and investment portfolios adverse economic developments specifically including inflationrelated impacts may have a negative effect on the ability of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans or to finance future home purchases according to the frbs october financial stability report commercial real estate cre values remained elevated relative to fundamentals even as prices continued to decline while cre values continue to fluctuate some markets are showing signs of stabilizing prices however the outlook for cre remains dependent on the broader economic environment and specifically how major subsectors respond to a rising interest rate environment and higher prices for commodities goods and services in any case credit performance over the mediumand longterm is susceptible to economic and market forces and therefore forecasts remain uncertain with some degree of instability in the cre markets expected in the coming quarters as loans are refinanced in markets with higher vacancy rates under current economic conditions instability and uncertainty in the commercial and residential real estate markets as well as in the broader commercial and retail credit markets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges and uncertainties affecting the stability of regions and countries around the globe could have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations for instance in response to the russiaukraine war the us has imposed and is likely to continue to impose significant financial and economic sanctions and export controls against certain russian organizations and individuals with similar actions being taken by the european union the united kingdom and other jurisdictions the russian invasion and subsequent sanctions had and could continue to have certain negative impacts on global and regional financial markets and economic conditions in addition the attacks by hamas on israel in october israels response and a potential broader armed conflict in the middle east are likely to continue impacting the global economy including that of the united states and have added to concerns of a widening conflict in the middle east in particular oil prices have become increasingly volatile in the aftermath of the attacks on israel each of the developments described above or any combination of them could adversely affect our businesses financial condition and results of operations our business could be adversely affected by difficult economic conditions in the regions in which we operate we operate in seven states and the district of columbia most of our customers are individuals and small and mediumsized businesses that are dependent upon their regional economies the economic conditions in these local markets may be different from and in some instances worse than economic conditions in the us as a whole challenging macroeconomic recessionary and employment conditions in the market areas we serve could result in the following consequences any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations such as demand for our loans deposits and services may decline loan delinquencies problem assets foreclosures and chargeoffs may increase weak economic conditions could limit the demand for loans by creditworthy borrowers limiting our capacity to leverage our retail deposits and maintain our net interest income collateral for our loans may decline in value and the amount of our lowcost or noninterestbearing deposits may decrease the banking and financial services industry continually encounters technological change especially in the systems that are used to deliver products to and execute transactions on behalf of customers if we fail to continue to invest in technological improvements as they become appropriate or necessary our ability to compete effectively could be severely impaired the banking and financial services industry continually undergoes technological changes with frequent introductions of new technologydriven products and services including recent and rapid developments in artificial intelligence the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better compete for and serve customers and reduce costs our future success will depend in part on our ability to address customer needs by using secure technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands as well as create additional efficiencies in our operations many of our larger competitors have greater resources to invest in technological improvements and we may not effectively implement new technologydriven products and services or do so as quickly as our competitors failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the banking and financial services industry could negatively affect our revenue and profitability in addition transactions utilizing digital assets including cryptocurrencies stablecoins and other similar assets have increased over the course of the last several years certain characteristics of digital asset transactions including their speed and anonymity are appealing to certain consumers notwithstanding the various risks posed by such transactions accordingly digital asset service providers which at present are not subject to the extensive regulation as banking organizations and other financial institutions have become active competitors for our customers banking business the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries known as disintermediation could result in the loss of fee income as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits further an initiative by the cfpb as prompted by the biden administration to promote open and decentralized banking through the proposal of a personal financial data rights rule designed to facilitate the transfer of customer information at the direction of the customer to other financial institutions could lead to greater competition for products and services among banks and nonbanks alike if a final rule is adopted the timing of and prospects for any such action are uncertain at this time the loss of these revenue streams and the higher cost of deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations an interruption in or breach in security of our information systems or other cybersecurity risks could result in a loss of customer business increased compliance and remediation costs civil litigation or governmental regulatory action and have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows as part of our business we collect process and retain sensitive and confidential client and customer information in both paper and electronic form and rely heavily on communications and information systems for these functions this information includes nonpublic personallyidentifiable information that is protected under applicable federal and state laws and regulations additionally certain of these data processing functions are not handled by us directly but are outsourced to thirdparty providers we have experienced cyberattacks in the past none of which have had a material impact on our business or operations and expect to continue to be the target of cyberattacks our current facilities and systems as well as those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches acts of vandalism and other physical security threats computer viruses or compromises ransomware attacks misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors or other similar events while we have policies procedures and practices designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure interruption or security breach of our communications and information systems we cannot completely ensure that any such failures interruptions or security breaches will not occur or if they do occur that they will be adequately addressed any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of our confidential business employee or customer information whether originating with us our vendors or retail businesses could severely damage our reputation expose us to the risks of civil litigation and liability require the payment of regulatory fines or penalties or undertaking of costly remediation efforts with respect to third parties affected by a security breach disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the cost of our daytoday cybersecurity monitoring and protection systems and controls may increase over time we may also need to expend substantial resources to comply with the data security breach notification requirements adopted by banking regulators and the states which have varying levels of individual consumer regulatory or law enforcement notification and remediation requirements in certain circumstances in the event of a security breach cybersecurity risks appear to be growing and as a result the cyberresilience of banking organizations is of increased importance to federal and state banking agencies and other regulators new or revised laws and regulations may significantly impact our current and planned privacy data protection and information securityrelated practices the collection use sharing retention and safeguarding of consumer and employee information and current or planned business activities compliance with current proposed or future privacy data protection and information security laws to which we are subject could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to provide certain products and services which could materially and adversely affect our profitability as technology advances the ability and speed to initiate transactions and access data has also become more widely distributed among mobile devices personal computers automated teller machines remote deposit capture sites and similar access points some of which are not controlled or secured by us it is possible that we could have exposure to liability and suffer losses as a result of a security breach or cyberattack that occurred through no fault of ours although we maintain specific cyber insurance coverage the amount or form of coverage may not be adequate in any particular case as cyber threats continue to evolve and increase we may be required to spend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective and preventative measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities o ur daytoday operations rely heavily on the proper functioning of products information systems and services provided by thirdparty external vendors we rely on certain external vendors to provide products information systems and services necessary including our core processing system to maintain our daytoday operations these third parties provide key components of our business operations such as data processing recording and monitoring transactions online banking interfaces and services internet connections and network access any complications caused by these third parties including those resulting from disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes cyberattacks and security breaches at a vendor including zeroday attacks associated with vulnerabilities in thirdparty software that were not previously known failure of a vendor to comply with applicable laws and regulations or to conform to our internal controls and risk management procedures and failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason or poor performance of services could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business there may be risks resulting from the extensive use of models in our business we rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values models may be used in such processes as determining the pricing of various products developing presentations made to market analysts and others creating loans and extending credit measuring interest rate and other market risks predicting losses assessing capital adequacy developing strategic planning initiatives capital stress testing and calculating regulatory capital levels as well as to estimate the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items poorly designed or implemented models present the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporating models will be adversely affected due to the inadequacy of such information also information we provide to the public or to our regulators based on poorly designed or implemented models could be inaccurate or misleading certain decisions that the regulators make including those related to capital distributions and dividends to our stockholders could be adversely affected due to the regulators perception that the quality of the models used to generate our relevant information is insufficient our asset valuations may include methodologies estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and this along with market factors such as volatility in one or more markets or industries could result in changes to asset valuations that may materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition we must use estimates assumptions and judgments when assets are measured and reported at fair value assets carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility because the assets are carried at fair value a decline in their value may cause us to incur losses even if the assets in question present minimal risk fair values and information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on quoted market prices andor other observable inputs provided by independent thirdparty resources when available when such thirdparty information is not available we estimate fair value primarily by using cash flow and other financial modeling techniques utilizing assumptions such as credit quality liquidity interest rates and other relevant inputs changes in underlying factors or assumptions in any of the areas underlying these estimates could materially impact our future financial condition and results of operations hurricanes tornadoes excessive rainfall droughts or other adverse weather events and public health emergencies could negatively affect the local economies in the markets of our footprint or disrupt our operations in those markets which could have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations the economy of the markets in our footprint is affected from time to time by adverse weather events and other disruptions including as a result of public health issues we cannot predict whether or to what extent damage caused by future weather conditions or other disruptions will affect our operations customers or the economies in our markets weather events could cause a disruption in our daytoday business activities in branches within our markets a decline in loan originations destruction or decline in the value of properties securing our loans or an increase in the risks of delinquencies foreclosures and loan losses even if a weather event does not cause any physical damage in our markets it could affect the market value of property within our footprint particularly agricultural interests which are highly sensitive to excessive rainfall or droughts legal and compliance risk fiscal challenges facing the us government could negatively impact financial markets which in turn could have an adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations a us government debt default threatened or wide spread perception of a potential debt default or downgrade of the sovereign credit ratings of the us by credit rating agencies could have an adverse impact on financial markets interest rates and economic conditions in the us and worldwide federal budget deficit concerns and the potential for political conflict over legislation to fund us government operations and raise the us governments debt limit may increase the possibility of a default by the us government on its debt obligations related creditrating downgrades or an economic recession in the us many of our investment securities are issued by the us government and government agencies and sponsored entities as a result of uncertain domestic political conditions including potential future federal government shutdowns possible reductions in federal government spending and the possibility of the federal government defaulting on its obligations for a period of time investments in financial instruments issued or guaranteed by the federal government pose liquidity risks a further downgrade or a downgrade by other rating agencies as well as sovereign debt issues facing the governments of other countries could have a material adverse impact on financial markets and economic conditions in the us and worldwide in addition to affecting the price and liquidity of us government securities a government default or threat of default could disrupt the market for or affect the pricing of repurchase agreements in us government securities repos a type of secured financing transaction used by many financial institutions including fnbpa to manage shortterm funding needs invest shortterm cash balances and manage inventories of government securities overnight rates on repo transactions are used by the frb to calculate sofr a disruption in the repo markets could affect interest rates paid on sofrbenchmarked loans and payments on swaps and other financial contracts that use sofr as a benchmark rate a debt default or further downgrades to the us governments sovereign credit rating or its perceived creditworthiness could also adversely affect the ability of the us government to support the financial stability of fannie mae freddie mac and the fhlbs with which we do business obtains financing engages with for sales of mortgages and in whose securities we invest our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in federal state or local tax rules and regulations or interpretations we are subject to legislative tax rate changes that could increase our effective tax rates depending on enactment dates these law changes may be retroactive to previous periods which could negatively affect our current and future financial performance our future effective tax rates could be affected by additional changes in the federal tax rates and in tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned by changes in or our interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business by unexpected negative changes in business and market conditions that could reduce certain tax benefits or by changes in the valuation of our dtas and dtls changes in statutory tax rates or dtas and dtls may adversely affect our profitability and results of operations in future periods our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in accounting policies standards and interpretations the fasb regulatory agencies and other bodies that establish accounting standards periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of our financial statements additionally those bodies that establish and interpret the accounting standards such as the fasb sec and banking regulators may change prior interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied changes resulting from these new standards may result in materially different financial results and may require that we change how we process analyze and report financial information and that we change financial reporting controls climate change and related legislative and regulatory initiatives may result in operational changes and expenditures that could significantly impact our business the current and anticipated effects of climate change are creating an increasing level of concern for the state of the global environment the us congress state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies have continued to propose and advance numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives seeking to mitigate the effects of climate change such initiatives have been pursued with rigor under the current presidential administration the leadership of the federal banking agencies including the frb and the occ have emphasized that their supervisory charge is not to regulate climate concerns but rather focus on climaterelated risks that are faced by banking organizations of all types and sizes specifically including physical and transition risks and are in the process of enhancing supervisory expectations through the implementation of climate related regulations and guidelines governing banks risk management practices which will likely result in increased compliance costs and other compliancerelated risks the above measures may also result in the imposition of taxes and fees the required purchase of emission credits and the implementation of significant operational changes each of which may require us to expend significant capital and incur compliance operating maintenance and remediation costs given the lack of empirical data on the credit and other financial risks posed by climate change it is impossible to predict how climate change may impact our financial condition and operations however as a banking organization the physical effects of climate change may present certain unique risks to us additionally in march the sec proposed new climaterelated disclosure rules which if adopted would require new climaterelated disclosures in sec filings and audited financial statements if adopted these rules would impose increased costs which could materially and adversely affect our financial performance we could be adversely affected by changes in the law especially changes in the regulation of the banking industry we operate in a highly regulated environment and our businesses are subject to supervision regulation enforcement and prosecution by numerous governmental agencies including at the federal and state levels regulations are generally intended to provide protection for depositors borrowers and other customers as well as the stability of the financial services industry rather than for investors in our securities we are subject to changes in federal and state law regulations governmental policies agency supervisory and enforcement policies and priorities and tax laws and accounting principles changes in regulations or the regulatory environment could adversely affect the banking and financial services industry as a whole and could limit our growth and the return to investors by restricting such activities as the payment of dividends and stock repurchases balance sheet growth investments loans and interest rates assessments of fees such as overdraft and interchange fees the provision of securities insurance brokerage or trust services mergers with or acquisitions of other institutions or branches the types of deposit and nondeposit activities in which our subsidiaries may engage and offering of new products and services under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines and other regulatory requirements fnb and fnbpa must meet guidelines subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components risk weightings and other factors on july the federal banking agencies including the occ issued a proposed rule to implement the final components of the basel iii standards among other things the proposed rule would substantially change the existing calculation of riskweighted assets and require banking organizations to use revised models for such calculations while the proposed rule would not apply to fnb or fnbpa directly based upon our current asset size many of the principles included in this proposed rulemaking could result in increased supervisory expectations and closer regulatory scrutiny for institutions that experience substantial growth for example the proposed rule would add back the impact of aoci loss to the calculation of regulatory capital for institutions above billion in assets and institutions below that threshold would be subject to federal banking agencies discretion to require institutions to have higher capital cushions to address a variety of supervisory concerns which may include a high level of aoci loss changes to present capital and liquidity requirements could restrict our activities and require us to maintain additional capital compliance with heightened capital standards may reduce our ability to generate or originate revenueproducing assets and thereby restrict revenue generation from banking and nonbanking operations if we fail to meet these minimum capital guidelines and other regulatory requirements our financial condition would be materially and adversely affected in response to several large bank failures in the spring of the federal banking agencies have engaged in rulemaking that likely will significantly increase compliance costs should we grow in excess of billion in assets our overdraft protection programs and corresponding revenue may be impacted by possible new federal regulatory requirements or scrutiny or industry trends regarding such practices members of congress and the leadership of the occ fdic and cfpb have expressed a heightened interest in bank overdraft protection programs the cfpb has used its supervision process to obtain additional information about financial institutions overdraft practices and has indicated that it intends to pursue enforcement actions against financial institutions and their executives that oversee overdraft practices that are deemed to be unlawful the cfpb also has published guidance containing instructions for financial institutions to avoid the imposition of unlawful overdraft fees in january the cfpb proposed two rules addressing financial institutions consumer overdraft and nonsufficient funds nsf fee practices by narrowing an existing exemption from the truth in lending act regulation z for the extension of overdraft credit thereby subjecting overdraft credit to disclosure and other regulatory compliance obligations and under those authorities prohibiting the imposition of nsf fees on transactions that are declined instantaneously or nearinstantaneously further in the cfpb brought enforcement actions and imposed substantial civil money penalties against certain financial institutions for overdraft practices and inadequate disclosures that the cfpb alleged to be unlawful and inadequately disclosed for among other things systematically and repeatedly charging fees to customers with insufficient funds in their accounts charging overdraft fees without proper consent and misleading customers about the terms and costs of overdraft coverage each of these actions is part of the cfpbs broader supervision and enforcement initiative targeting socalled consumer junk fees in addition the occ issued a bulletin in april to address the risks associated with national banks overdraft protection programs and overdraft fees specifically the occ noted in the bulletin that authorize positive settle negative apsn transaction and representment fee practices may present a heightened risk of violations of section of the federal trade commission act of which prohibits unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices an apsn transaction refers to the practice of assessing overdraft fees on debit card transactions that authorize when a customers available balance is positive but later post to the account when the available balance is negative representment fees refer to assessing an additional fee each time a third party submits the same transaction for payment after a bank returns the transaction for nonsufficient funds the occ further noted that banks should establish and maintain sound risk management of overdraft protection programs by establishing effective board and management oversight and appropriate procedures and practices for managing risks associated with overdraft protection programs in response to this increased governmental scrutiny of the financial services industry and in anticipation of possible enhanced supervision and enforcement of overdraft protection practices in the future certain banking organizations including fnb have modified their overdraft protection programs including by discontinuing the imposition of overdraft transaction fees these competitive pressures from our peers as well as any adoption by our regulators of new rules or supervisory guidance including the new rules proposed by the cfpb or more aggressive examination and enforcement policies in respect of banks overdraft protection practices could cause us to modify our program and practices in ways that may have a negative impact on our revenue and earnings in addition as supervisory expectations and industry practices regarding overdraft protection programs change our continued offering of overdraft protection may result in negative public opinion and increased reputation risk despite our effort to modify our overdraft practices to conform to recent regulatory guidance and expectations and industry practices we may remain subject to regulatory criticism or potential enforcement action particularly in view of the cfpbs aggressive interpretations and guidance regarding bank overdraft practices and potentially subject to negative public reaction through our continued offering of certain of these products and services certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and pennsylvania law may discourage takeovers our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain certain antitakeover provisions that may discourage or may make more difficult or expensive a tender offer change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by our board of directors in particular our articles of incorporation and bylaws require shareholders to give us advance notice to nominate candidates for election to our board of directors or to solicit proxies in support of such candidates or to make shareholder proposals at a shareholders meeting permit our board of directors to issue without approval of our common shareholders unless otherwise required by law preferred stock with such terms as our board of directors may determine require the vote of the holders of at least of our voting shares for shareholder amendments to our bylaws in the case of a proposed business combination with a shareholder owning or more of the voting shares of fnb the vote of the holders of at least twothirds of the voting shares not owned by such shareholder is required to approve the business combination unless it is approved by a majority of fnbs disinterested directors under pennsylvania law only shareholders holding at least of a corporations outstanding stock may call a special meeting for any purpose in addition pennsylvania law provides that in discharging their duties including in the context of a takeover attempt the board of directors committees of the board and individual directors may consider a broad range of factors as they deem pertinent which may include but is not limited to shareholders interests in considering the best interests of the corporation these provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and of pennsylvania law could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control even though the holders of a majority of our stock may consider such proposals desirable such provisions could also make it more difficult for third parties to remove and replace members of our board of directors moreover these provisions could diminish the opportunities for shareholders to participate in certain tender offers including tender offers at prices above the thencurrent market price of our common stock and may also inhibit increases in the trading price of our common stock that could result from takeover attempts volatility in the banking sector triggered by the failures of silicon valley bank signature bank and first republic bank has resulted in agency rulemaking activities and changes in agency policies and priorities that could subject fnb and fnbpa to enhanced government regulation and supervision on march silicon valley bank sivb was closed by the california department of financial protection and innovation the cdfpi two days later on march signature bank sbny also failed nearly two months later on may first republic bank frc was closed by the cdfpi in each case the fdic was appointed as receiver each of these institutions experienced significant deposit losses in the runup to their ultimate failures investor and customer confidence in the banking sectorparticularly with regard to midsize and larger regional banking organizationswaned in response to these failures further evaluation of recent developments in the banking sector has led to governmental initiatives intended to prevent future bank failures and stem significant deposit outflows from the banking sector including i agency rulemaking to modify and enhance relevant regulatory requirements specifically with respect to liquidity risk management deposit concentrations capital adequacy stress testing and contingency planning and safe and sound banking practices and ii enhancement of the agencies supervision and examination policies and priorities examiners at the federal banking agencies generally have increased their focus on levels of uninsured deposits liquidity and contingency funding plans we cannot predict with certainty which proposed rules will be adopted or if other initiatives may be pursued by lawmakers and agency leadership nor can we predict the terms and scope of any such initiatives including whether we would be impacted however any of the proposed or potential changes could among other things subject us to additional costs limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and limit our future growth any of which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition the proportion of our deposit account balances that exceed fdic insurance limits may expose fnbpa to enhanced liquidity risk in times of financial distress in the wake of the failures of sivb sbny and frc which the fdic concluded were generated by in significant part a high volume of uninsured deposits many large depositors across the industry have withdrawn deposits in excess of applicable deposit insurance limits and deposited these funds in other financial institutions in many instances depositors moved these funds into money market mutual funds or other similar securities accounts in an effort to diversify the risk of further bank failures uninsured deposits historically have been viewed by the fdic as less stable than insured deposits the federal banking agencies including the fdic and occ issued an interagency policy statement in july noting that banks should maintain actionable contingency funding plans that take into account a range of possible stress scenarios assess the stability of their funding and maintain a broad range of funding sources ensure that collateral is available for borrowing and review and revise contingency funding plans periodically and more frequently as market conditions and strategic initiatives change if a significant portion of our deposits were to be withdrawn within a short period of time such that additional sources of funding would be required to meet withdrawal demands we may be unable to obtain funding at favorable terms which may have an adverse effect on our net interest margin moreover obtaining adequate funding to meet our deposit obligations may be more challenging during periods of elevated prevailing interest rates such as the present period our ability to attract depositors during a time of actual or perceived distress or instability in the marketplace may be limited further interest rates paid for borrowings generally exceed the interest rates paid on deposits this spread may be exacerbated by higher prevailing interest rates in addition because our afs investment securities lose value when interest rates rise aftertax proceeds resulting from the sale of such assets may be diminished during periods when interest rates are elevated under such circumstances we may be required to access funding from sources such as the federal reserves discount window in order to manage our liquidity risk we have experienced increases in our fdic insurance assessments due to the bank failures that occurred in the losses incurred by the dif in connection with the resolution of sivb and sbny are required by law to be recovered through one or more special assessments on depository institutions and potentially their holding companies if the fdic determines such action to be appropriate and the secretary of the ust concurs with the fdics determination on november the fdic issued its final rule that would impose such special assessments there is the possibility for the fdic to impose a onetime shortfall special assessment this will occur if the total amount collected by the fdic special assessment does not meet the final loss amounts of sivb and sbny after the termination of the receiverships fnbpa had uninsured deposits of billion as of december and we accrued and expensed a special assessment of million based on the assessment base of billion which excludes the first billion of fnbpas uninsured deposits as of december although we cannot predict if there will be a subsequent shortfall after the eight quarters any additional increase in our assessment fees could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition adverse changes to our credit ratings could limit our access to funding and increase our borrowing costs credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by rating agencies which consider a number of factors including our financial strength performance prospects and operations as well as factors not under our control other factors that influence our credit ratings include changes to the rating agencies methodologies for our industry or certain security types the rating agencies assessment of the general operating environment for financial services companies our relative positions in the markets in which we compete our various risk exposures and risk management policies and activities pending litigation and other contingencies our reputation our liquidity position diversity of funding sources and funding costs the current and expected level and volatility of our earnings our capital position and capital management practices our corporate governance current or future regulatory and legislative initiatives and the agencies views on whether the us government would provide meaningful support to fnb or its subsidiaries in a crisis rating agencies could make adjustments to our credit ratings at any time and there can be no assurance that they will maintain our ratings at current levels or that downgrades will not occur any downgrade in our credit ratings could potentially adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to borrow or obtain funding increase our cost of capital andor limit our access to capital markets credit rating downgrades or negative watch warnings could negatively impact our reputation with lenders investors and other third parties which could also impair our ability to compete in certain markets or engage in certain transactions in particular holders of deposits which exceed fdic insurance limits may perceive such a downgrade or warning negatively and withdraw all or a portion of such deposits while certain aspects of a credit rating downgrade are quantifiable the impact that such a downgrade would have on our liquidity business and results of operations in future periods is inherently uncertain and would depend on a number of interrelated factors including among other things the magnitude of the downgrade the rating relative to peers the rating assigned by the relevant agency predowngrade individual client behavior and future mitigating actions we might take we are subject to supervision and examination by us government authorities and may become subject to investigations enforcement actions fines and other adverse effects the federal banking agencies including the occ the cfpb as well as the doj have in recent years adopted a more aggressive enforcement posture in line with general enforcement priorities specifically with respect to consumer protection issues and antidiscrimination lending laws these government agencies have expressed a heightened interest in fair lending and loan servicing mortgage loan origination and mortgage loan servicing bank and financial institution sales practices management of consumer accounts and the charging of overdraft and various other fees fair credit reporting predatory lending debt collection and meaningful disclosure of credit and savings terms among others and perform periodic reviews examinations and investigations in these areas an adverse finding or outcome of any such review examination or investigation that involves an assertion of regulatory noncompliance or a violation of law could result in possible fines penalties restitution or other forms of remediation that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or reputation further evaluation of recent developments after the failures of sivb sbny and frc may lead to legislative and regulatory initiatives intended to prevent future bank failures raise capital requirements and stem significant deposit outflows from the banking sector although we cannot predict with certainty which initiatives may be pursued by lawmakers and agency leadership nor can we predict the terms and scope of any such initiatives any potential changes could among other things subject us to additional costs and capital requirements limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and limit our future growth any of which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition we are subject to the cra and fair lending laws and failure to comply with these laws could lead to material penalties the cra the equal credit opportunity act ecoa the fair housing act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions the cra requires the occ in connection with its examination of a national bank to assess the institutions record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution all institutions insured by the fdic must publicly disclose their rating on october the federal banking agencies issued a joint final rule to revise the regulations implementing cra fnbpa is considered a large bank under the final rule and therefore will be evaluated under new lending retail services and products community development financing and community development services tests in respect of our compliance with the statute and rule the final rule also imposes certain data reporting requirements that will apply to fnbpa as we prepare for implementation of the final rule we expect to incur increased compliance costs and we may be exposed to compliancerelated risks after the final rule has been implemented in full the fair lending laws prohibit discrimination in the provision of banking services on the basis of prohibited factors including among others race color national origin gender and religion the enforcement of these laws has been an increasing focus for the cfpb and other regulators of note in march the director of the cfpb has indicated that the cfpb will prioritize enforcement of ecoa as implemented by the cfpbs regulation b which prohibits discrimination in any aspect of a credit transaction by revising its supervision and examination manual to explicitly incorporate antidiscrimination considerations in respect of evaluations of potential unfair deceptive or abusive acts and practices udaaps the cfpbs action represents not only a continuation of the agencys commitment to a more aggressive enforcement approach but also a shift in supervision and examination policy and procedure that may result in the commencement of enforcement actions against financial institutions involving a broader range of cited violations of the federal consumer financial laws and expanded allegations of udaaps under the fair lending laws we may be liable if our policies result in a disparate treatment of or have a disparate impact on a protected class of applicants or borrowers and may also be subject to investigation by the doj a successful challenge to our institutions performance under the cra or fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties injunctive relief imposition of restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity and restrictions on expansion activity private parties may also have the ability to challenge our performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation the consent orders entered into by fnbpa with the doj and the north carolina state department of justice will cause us to incur additional compliance costs may harm our reputation and may restrict our ability to engage in certain business activities and transactions and our failure to comply with the terms of such consent orders may subject us to further enforcement actions on february fnbpa announced its entry into consent orders together the consent orders with the doj and the north carolina state department of justice the consent orders resolve allegations that from to fnbpaincluding as a successor in interest to yadkin bank which fnbpa acquired in committed violations of the fair housing act and the equal credit opportunity act regulation b as well as the north carolina unfair and deceptive practices act within the charlotte north carolina and winstonsalem north carolina assessment areas the consent orders were approved by the us district court for the middle district of north carolina on february we are committed to full compliance with the consent orders however achieving such compliance will require attention from our management and will cause us to bear costs to implement their terms actions taken to achieve compliance with the consent orders may affect our business or financial performance and may require us to reallocate resources away from existing operations or to alter our business practices operations products and services and risk management practices our failure to comply with the requirements of the consent orders could cause us to incur additional significant compliance costs or subject us to additional enforcement action and any deficiencies in our compliance practices as well as the terms of the consent orders could result in additional inquiries investigations or enforcement actions further the existence of the consent orders may adversely affect our reputation in the communities we serve and among third parties with which we conduct business under the current regulatory framework governing proposed business combinations an institutions compliance with the fair lending laws and whether it is subject to an open or pending enforcement action are significant factors for the federal banking agencies in determining whether a proposed transaction is consistent with safe and sound banking principles further the occ has announced a proposed rule to amend and enhance its regulatory framework for review of proposed national bank merger transactions under the bank merger act bma under the occs proposed rule the occ staff is unlikely to view a proposed merger transaction involving an acquirer with an open or pending fair lending enforcement action as being consistent with approval under the bma although the consent orders constitute the resolution of open enforcement actions under the occs proposed rule ongoing compliance in a timely manner with the consent orders would be an important factor in the occs evaluation of any proposed transaction we may present to the occ for approval the consent orders will be in effect for a minimum of five years which term could be longer depending upon the extent and timing of the requisite loan subsidies that will be paid by fnbpa to qualified applicants accordingly if the occs proposed rule is adopted as proposed our ability to pursue strategic growth initiatives involving combinations with other banking organizations may be substantially limited as a result should we pursue future bank acquisitions we expect the bank regulatory approval process to be prolonged and more costly than we have experienced in the past which restrictions could materially adversely affect our business results of operation and financial condition strategic risk if we are not able to continue our historical levels of growth we may not be able to maintain our historical revenue trends to achieve our past levels of growth we have focused on both organic growth and acquisitions we may not be able to sustain our historical rate of growth or may not be able to grow at all more specifically we may not be able to obtain the financing necessary to fund additional growth various factors such as economic conditions regulatory and other governmental concerns and competition may impede or prohibit the opening of new retail branches or optimizing our existing branch network if we are not able to continue our historical levels of growth we may not be able to maintain our historical revenue trends on january the occ announced a proposed rule to amend the procedures and principles followed by the occ when reviewing proposed national bank merger transactions under the bma if adopted as proposed the proposed rule would eliminate existing regulatory procedures under the occs regulations providing for expedited review and streamlining of bma applications for acquiring institutions that meet certain minimum qualifications and implement certain principles to be followed by the occ when reviewing applications under the bma such principles would among other things establish indicators of proposed transactions that generally are consistent with regulatory approval as well as those that raise supervisory or regulatory concerns and therefore would require applicants to address or remediate specific areas of concern in order to secure regulatory approval of note any transaction whereby the resulting institution would have combined assets of billion or more would not be generally consistent with regulatory approval nor would any transaction for which the applicant has insufficient cra or examination ratings is the subject of an open or pending bsaantimoney laundering aml or fair lending enforcement action or has failed to comply with the terms of an existing enforcement action in such cases bma applications would be subject to additional scrutiny and are more likely to involve extended processing periods andor result in denials of approval or regulatory requests to withdraw the application the proposed rule is subject to a public comment period and the timing and prospects for the adoption by the occ of a final rule are not certain at this time if the proposed rule is adopted as proposed our ability to further grow through bank acquisitions may be substantially limited based upon our current asset size and the recent consent orders entered into by fnbpa with the doj and the north carolina state department of justice to resolve allegations of fair lending violations further should we pursue future bank acquisitions we expect the bank regulatory approval process to be prolonged and more costly than we have experienced in the past
