item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda represents an overview of and highlights material changes to our financial condition and consolidated results of operations this mda should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes presented in item of this report results of operations for the periods included in this review are not necessarily indicative of results to be obtained during any future period cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking information this report may contain statements regarding our outlook for earnings revenues expenses tax rates capital and liquidity levels and ratios asset quality levels financial position and other matters regarding or affecting our current or future business and operations these statements can be considered forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these forwardlooking statements involve various assumptions risks and uncertainties which can change over time actual results or future events may be different from those anticipated in our forwardlooking statements and may not align with historical performance and events as forwardlooking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties caution should be exercised against placing undue reliance upon such statements forwardlooking statements are typically identified by words such as believe plan expect anticipate intend outlook estimate forecast will should project goal and other similar words and expressions we do not assume any duty to update forwardlooking statements except as required by federal securities laws our forwardlooking statements are subject to the following principal risks and uncertainties our business financial results and balance sheet values are affected by business economic and political circumstances including but not limited to i developments with respect to the us and global financial markets ii actions by the frb fdic ust occ and other governmental agencies especially those that impact money supply market interest rates or otherwise affect business activities of the financial services industry iii a slowing of the us economic environment iv the impacts of tariffs or other trade policies of the us or its global trading partners and the sociopolitical environment in the us business and operating results are affected by our ability to identify and effectively manage risks inherent in our businesses including where appropriate through effective use of systems and controls thirdparty insurance derivatives and capital management techniques and to meet evolving regulatory capital and liquidity standards competition can have an impact on customer acquisition growth and retention and on credit spreads deposit gathering and product pricing which can affect market share deposits and revenues our ability to anticipate react quickly and continue to respond to technological changes and covid19 challenges can also impact our ability to respond to customer needs and meet competitive demands business and operating results can also be affected by widespread natural and other disasters pandemics including the ongoing covid19 pandemic crisis dislocations terrorist activities system failures security breaches significant political events cyberattacks or international hostilities through impacts on the economy and financial markets generally or on us or our counterparties specifically legal regulatory and accounting developments could have an impact on our ability to operate and grow our businesses financial condition results of operations competitive position and reputation reputational impacts could affect matters such as business generation and retention liquidity funding and the ability to attract and retain management these developments could include changes resulting from a new us presidential administration including legislative and regulatory reforms different approaches to supervisory or enforcement priorities changes affecting oversight of the financial services industry regulatory obligations or restrictions consumer protection taxes employee benefits compensation practices pension bankruptcy and other industry aspects and changes in accounting policies and principles changes to regulations or accounting standards governing bank capital requirements loan loss reserves and liquidity standards unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings or other claims and regulatory and other governmental investigations or other inquiries these matters may result in monetary judgments or settlements or other remedies including fines penalties restitution or alterations in our business practices and in additional expenses and collateral costs and may cause reputational harm to fnb results of the regulatory examination and supervision process including our failure to satisfy requirements imposed by the federal bank regulatory agencies or other governmental agencies the impact on our financial condition results of operations financial disclosures and future business strategies related to acl changes due to changes in forecasted macroeconomic scenarios commonly referred to as the current expected credit loss standard or cecl a failure or disruption in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of third parties including as a result of cyberattacks or campaigns the covid19 pandemic and the federal state and local regulatory and governmental actions implemented in response to covid19 have resulted in significant deterioration and disruption in financial markets national and local economic conditions and record levels of unemployment and business failures and could have a material impact on among other things our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity or on our management employees customers and critical vendors and suppliers in view of the many unknowns associated with the covid19 pandemic our forwardlooking statements continue to be subject to various conditions that may be substantially different than what we are currently expecting including but not limited to a weakened us economic recovery prolonged economic recovery deterioration of commercial and consumer customer fundamentals and sentiments and impairment of the recovery of the us labor market as a result the covid19 outbreaks and its consequences including responsive measures to manage it or provide relief and the uncertainty regarding its duration may possibly have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial performance the risks identified here are not exclusive or the types of risks we may confront and actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of these risks and uncertainties including but not limited to the risk factors and other uncertainties described under item risk factors and risk management sections in this annual report on s with the sec which are available on our corporate website at httpswwwfnbonlinecomaboutusinvestorrelationsshareholderservices more specifically our forwardlooking statements may be subject to the evolving risks and uncertainties related to the covid19 pandemic and its macroeconomic impact and the resulting governmental business and societal responses to it we have included our web address as an inactive textual reference only information on our website is not part of this report application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap application of these principles requires management to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes these estimates assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements accordingly as this information changes the consolidated financial statements could reflect different estimates assumptions and judgments certain policies inherently are based to a greater extent on estimates assumptions and judgments of management and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported for example on january we adopted cecl under the cecl methodology the acl represents the expected lifetime credit losses on loans and leases that we do not expect to collect the most significant accounting policies followed by fnb are presented in note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements which is included in item of this report these policies along with the disclosures presented in the notes to consolidated financial statements provide information on how we value significant assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements how we determine those values and how we record transactions in the consolidated financial statements management views critical accounting policies to be those which are highly dependent on subjective or complex judgments estimates and assumptions and where changes in those estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements management currently views the determination of the acl fair value of financial instruments goodwill and other intangible assets income taxes and dtas and litigation reserves to be critical accounting policies allowance for credit losses the acl is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans and leases resulting in the net amount expected to be collected we charge off loans against the acl in accordance with our policies or if a loss confirming event occurs expected recoveries do not exceed the aggregate of the amounts previously chargedoff and expected to be chargedoff the model used to calculate the acl is dependent on the portfolio composition and credit quality as well as historical experience current conditions and forecasts of economic conditions and interest rates specifically the following considerations are incorporated into the acl calculation a thirdparty macroeconomic forecast scenario a 24month rs forecast period for macroeconomic factors with a reversion to the historical mean on a straightline basis over a 12month period and the historical throughthecycle default mean calculated using an expanded period to include a prior recessionary period adjustments to historical loss information where applicable are made for differences in current loanspecific risk characteristics such as differences in lending policies and procedures underwriting standards experience and depth of relevant personnel the quality of our credit review function concentrations of credit external factors such as the regulatory legal and technological environments competition and events such as natural disasters and other relevant factors such factors are used to adjust the historical probabilities of default and severity of loss so that they reflect managements expectation of future conditions based on a rs forecast to the extent the lives of the loans in the portfolio extend beyond the period for which a rs forecast can be made the model reverts over months on a straightline basis back to the historical rates of default and severity of loss over the remaining life of the loans determining the appropriateness of the acl is complex and requires significant management judgment about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain due to those significant management judgments and the factors included in the calculation significant changes to the acl level could occur in future periods the provision for credit losses section in the results of operations includes a discussion of the factors affecting changes in the acl during the current period see note summary of significant accounting policies and note loans and leases in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on the acl fair value of financial instruments we use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain financial assets and liabilities and determine fair value disclosures additionally from time to time we may be required to record at fair value other assets on a nonrecurring basis such as loans held for sale certain impaired loans msrs oreo and certain other assets the accounting guidance for fair value measurements includes a threelevel hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used for measurement are observable or unobservable judgment is required to determine which level of the threelevel hierarchy certain assets or liabilities measured at fair value are classified fair value represents the price that would be received to sell a financial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date we use significant and complex estimates assumptions and judgments when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at or adjusted to reflect fair value where available fair value and information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets or liabilities is based on either quoted market prices or are provided by independent thirdparty sources including appraisers and valuation specialists when such thirdparty information is not available we may estimate fair value by using cash flow and other financial modeling techniques our assumptions about what a market participant would use in pricing an asset or liability is developed based on the best information available in the circumstances these estimates are inherently subjective and can result in significant changes in the fair value estimates over the life of the asset or liability assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility see note summary of significant accounting policies and note fair value measurements in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of accounting for financial instruments goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of acquisitions we have recorded goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheets goodwill represents the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of net assets including identifiable intangible assets at the acquisition date our recorded goodwill relates to value inherent in our community banking wealth management and insurance segments the value of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles is dependent upon our ability to provide high quality costeffective services in the face of competition as such these values are supported ultimately by revenue that is driven by the volume of business transacted a decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth or our inability to deliver costeffective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment in value which could result in additional expense and adversely impact earnings in future periods goodwill and other intangibles are subject to impairment testing at the reporting unit level which must be conducted at least annually we perform annual impairment testing during the fourth quarter or more frequently if impairment indicators exist we also continue to monitor other intangibles for impairment and to evaluate carrying amounts as necessary in connection with the preparation of the yearend financial statements we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of october which included certain assumption updates to market levels the excess of fair values over carrying values or cushion of our reporting units as a percentage of their carrying value ranged from in our community banking reporting unit to greater than in our wealth and insurance reporting units resulting in the conclusion that the goodwill assigned to each reporting unit as of october was not impaired we also performed a qualitative analysis and concluded that it was not morelikelythannot that the fair value of one or more of our reporting units was below its respective carrying amount and therefore no triggering event has occurred as of december if economic conditions deteriorate or the pandemics effects prolong or worsen it may be morelikelythannot that the fair value of one or more of our reporting units falls below its respective carrying amount which would require us to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test before our next annual assessment any impairment charge would not affect our capital ratios tangible common equity tangible book value per share or liquidity position inputs and assumptions used in estimating fair value include projected future cash flows discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows longterm growth rates anticipated cost savings and an evaluation of market comparables and recent transactions we considered the sensitivity of significant assumptions in our impairment analysis including consideration of changes in estimated future cash flows and change in the discount rate for each reporting unit the hypothetical sensitivity of the estimated fair value of our community banking reporting unit to an immediate and isolated increase of basis points in the discount rate assumption at october without consideration of any offsetting or simultaneous effects of other key assumptions would not result in impairment but could reduce the excess fair value over the carrying value below the purpose of this sensitivity is to provide an indication of the isolated impacts of hypothetical alternative assumptions on modeled fair value estimates and is not considered probable see note summary of significant accounting policies and note goodwill and other intangible assets in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets income taxes and deferred tax assets we are subject to the income tax laws of federal state and other taxing jurisdictions where we conduct business the laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and various taxing authorities in determining the provision for income taxes management must make judgments and estimates about the application of these inherently complex tax statutes related regulations and case law in the process of preparing our tax returns management attempts to make reasonable interpretations of the tax laws these interpretations are subject to challenge by the taxing authorities or based on managements ongoing assessment of the facts and evolving case law we determine deferred income taxes using the balance sheet method under this method the net dta or dtl is based on the tax effects of the differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities and recognizes the effect of enacted changes in tax rates and laws in the period in which they occur that effect would be included in income in the reporting period that includes the enactment date of the change see the results of operations income taxes section later in this mda for further taxrelated discussion on a quarterly basis management assesses the reasonableness of our effective tax rate based on managements current best estimate of pretax earnings and the applicable taxes for the full year dtas and dtls are assessed on an annual basis or sooner if business events or circumstances warrant dtas represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and from operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies we establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize a benefit from our dtas or when future deductibility is uncertain periodically the valuation allowance is reviewed and adjusted based on managements assessments of realizable dtas see note summary of significant accounting policies and note income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of accounting for income taxes litigation reserves the corporation is involved in various pending and threatened legal proceedings in which claims for monetary damages and other relief are asserted these claims result from ordinary business activities relating to our current andor former operations although the ultimate outcome for any asserted claim cannot be predicted with certainty we believe that the corporation has valid defenses for all asserted claims in accordance with applicable accounting guidance when a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable we in conjunction with internal and outside counsel handling the matter record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss we continue to monitor the matter for further developments that could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has previously been established litigation expense represents a key area of judgment and is subject to uncertainty and factors outside of our control significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our financial liabilities may ultimately be more or less than the current estimate see our policy on establishing accruals for litigation in note commitments credit risk and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements recent accounting pronouncements and developments note new accounting standards in the notes to consolidated financial statements which is included in item of this report discusses new accounting pronouncements adopted by us in and the expected impact of accounting pronouncements recently issued but not yet required to be adopted use of nongaap financial measures and key performance indicators to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with gaap we use certain nongaap financial measures such as operating net income available to common stockholders operating earnings per diluted common share return on average tangible common equity return on average tangible assets tangible book value per common share the ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets acl to loans and leases excluding ppp loans preprovision net revenue to average tangible common equity efficiency ratio and net interest margin fte to provide information useful to investors in understanding our operating performance and trends and to facilitate comparisons with the performance of our peers management uses these measures internally to assess and better understand our underlying business performance and trends related to core business activities the nongaap financial measures and key performance indicators we use may differ from the nongaap financial measures and key performance indicators other financial institutions use to assess their performance and trends these nongaap financial measures should be viewed as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for or superior to our reported results prepared in accordance with gaap when nongaap financial measures are disclosed the secs regulation g requires i the presentation of the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap and ii a reconciliation of the differences between the nongaap financial measure presented and the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap reconciliations of nongaap operating measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures are included later in this report under the heading reconciliations of nongaap financial measures and key performance indicators to gaap management believes charges such as merger expenses branch consolidation costs loss on early debt extinguishment covid19 expenses and gains on sale of visa class b shares are not organic costs to run our operations and facilities these charges are considered significant items impacting earnings as they are deemed to be outside of ordinary banking activities the merger expenses and branch consolidation charges principally represent expenses to satisfy contractual obligations of the acquired entity or closed branches without any useful ongoing benefit to us these costs are specific to each individual transaction and may vary significantly based on the size and complexity of the transaction similarly gains derived from the sale of visa class b stock and losses on fhlb debt extinguishment and related hedge terminations are not organic to our operations the covid19 expenses represent special company initiatives to support our employees and the communities we serve during an unprecedented time of a pandemic to provide more meaningful comparisons of net interest margin and efficiency ratio we use net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis in calculating net interest margin by increasing the interest income earned on taxexempt assets loans and investments to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments this adjustment is not permitted under gaap taxableequivalent amounts for the and periods were calculated using a federal statutory income tax rate of overview fnb headquartered in pittsburgh pennsylvania is a diversified

global economy on march the ust announced that financial institution employees are part of the critical infrastructure workforce and stated that these employees have a special responsibility to maintain your normal work schedule as a result financial institutions were confronted with the challenge of protecting the health and safety of their employees while also ensuring that critical financial services such as providing consumer and commercial access to banking and lending services maintaining core systems and the integrity and security of data continuing the processing of payments and services such as clearing and settlement services wholesale funding insurance services and capital markets activities for the duration of the pandemic crisis period our crisis and risk management processes were critical to our preparedness for the covid19 pandemic since we had the necessary plans in place and had conducted a pandemic emergency event scenario involving key management and operations employees in the fourth quarter of to test the efficacy of our pandemic response plans and to improve these plans we were well positioned to continue providing critical financial services to our customers through multiple channels such as interactive teller machines automated teller machines our mobile application and our interactive website we adjusted our physical retail locations by focusing on drive up services and closed our lobbies reverting to by appointment only practices while maintaining appropriate health sanitization social distancing and other safety protocols consistent with the centers for disease control and prevention cdc and state guidelines based on the available covid19 federal data we began to reopen our branch lobbies to customers in july while adhering to cdc safety measures including employee and customer safety ie masks social distancing and cleaning protocols while continuing to regularly monitor and adjust branch hours based on local covid19 conditions and circumstances we leveraged our information technology infrastructure by making accommodations to give employees the ability to work remotely where appropriate our executive and senior management worked rotating schedules or from remote offices or home in order to mitigate the risk of widespread occurrence of the covid19 contagion among this group with respect to our other employees approximately half of our workforce worked remotely we will continue to actively monitor case levels and consider guidance from government agencies to determine when we activate further returntothe workplace schedules our remote and rotational working arrangements and implementation of cdc health and safety protocols have not impaired our ability to continue to operate our business we do rely on some third parties for certain services at this time we have not experienced a disruption in those services to protect our customers and communities from economic disruption we developed a formal loan deferral program and other measures to support customers who may be enduring financial hardships extended the residential mortgage foreclosure moratorium beyond the requirements for governmentbacked loans under the cares act to all residential mortgage loan customers and actively participated in the sba ppp which authorized financial institutions to make federally guaranteed loans that are eligible to be forgiven to qualifying small businesses and nonprofits on the terms set forth in the cares act and related regulations we continue to evaluate other covid19 related frb and federal government relief and stimulus programs to determine their suitability for our customers and communities covid19 has had a significant impact on the provision for credit losses during the uncertainty in the market a significant increase in unemployment and adverse economic forecasts all point to the volatility of the expected additional losses in the loan portfolio we would expect inherent volatility in the covid19 impact on our provision for credit losses for the duration of the current covid19 pandemic environment and immediate periods following the mitigation of the pandemic crisis the federal banking regulators have in place certain measures to assist financial institutions in meeting the needs of our customers during this time some of these that impact us are as follows as part of section of the cares act and in accordance with federal interagency bank regulatory guidance financial institutions have been granted temporary relief from reporting tdrs caused by covid19 to be eligible for tdr relief a loan modification must be due to impacts from covid19 not more than days past due as of december and executed between march and the earlier of january or days after the end of the national emergency interagency bank regulatory guidance encourages financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers who are or may be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations because of the effects of covid19 and will not criticize financial institutions for working with borrowers in a safe and sound manner loan modification programs are considered positive actions that can mitigate adverse effects on borrowers due to covid19 institutions generally do not need to categorize covid19related loan modifications as tdrs if the loan modifications are shortterm in nature and are made on a goodfaith basis in response to covid19 to borrowers who were current at the time the modification program was implemented for borrowers who were current prior to covid19 that have requested and been granted a concession while experiencing a hardship during the pandemic we will not be including those modifications as past due or a tdr at the time of the concession as of june approximately billion or of our loan portfolio was approved during the initial deferment request window over of the billion of loans in deferment were current and in good standing at december as of december total deferrals decreased to million or of total loans and leases excluding ppp loans the regulatory agencies have agreed to allow an option to delay the effects of cecl on regulatory capital by two years for those financial institutions that adopt in this delay will be followed by a threeyear transition period of and respectively we adopted cecl in january and have elected this option the frb initiated a facility to provide liquidity to financial institutions participating and funding loans for the ppp the nonrecourse loans are available to institutions eligible to make ppp loans with the sbaguaranteed loans pledged as collateral to the frb financial institutions can also pledge ppp loans to the discount window each liquidity option is set at different rates and terms ppp loans pledged to the ppplf may be excluded from leverage ratio calculations we have not utilized this facility as we have ample liquidity as we continue to manage through the covid19 challenges and meet the needs of our various constituents our focus continues to be on our four key pillars the pillars are employee protection and assistance operational response and preparedness customer and community support and risk management and actions taken to preserve shareholder value given the extreme challenges presented libor the united kingdoms financial conduct authority fca who is the regulator of libor anticipates libor to retire on december for oneweek and twomonth libor rates and june for all other libor rates the frb of new york has created a working group called the arrc to assist us institutions with a successful transition away from using libor as a benchmark interest rate similarly we created an internal working group that is managing our transition away from libor this working group is a crossfunctional team composed of representatives from the commercial retail and mortgage banking lines of business as well as loan operations information technology legal finance and other support functions the committee has completed an assessment of tasks needed for the transition identified contracts that contain libor language is in process of reviewing existing contract language for the presence of robust fallback language developed loan fallback language for when libor is retired and identified risks associated with the transition the financial impact regarding pricing valuation and operations of the transition is not yet known our transition team will work within the guidelines established by the fca and arrc to provide for a smooth transition away from libor during the third quarter of we finalized the transition of new adjustable rate mortgages away from the libor index to sofr which is the alternative rate recommended by arrc the effective date for this change was october we also changed our valuation methodology to reflect changes made by central clearinghouses to their discounting methodology and interest calculation of cash margin to sofr for us dollar cleared interest rate swaps the effective date for this change was october results of operations year ended december compared to year ended

liquidity impacts related to covid19 into our daily analysis management concluded that our cash levels remain appropriate given the current market environment two metrics that are used to gauge the adequacy of the parent companys cash position are the lcr and mch the lcr is defined as the sum of cash on hand plus projected cash inflows over the next months divided by projected cash outflows over the next months the mch is defined as the number of months of corporate expenses and dividends that can be covered by the cash on hand the lcr and mch ratios are presented in the following table table table start december internal limit liquidity coverage ratio times times time months of cash on hand months months months table end our liquidity position has been positively impacted by our ability to generate growth in relationshipbased accounts organic growth in lowcost transaction deposits was complemented by managements strategy of deposit gathering efforts focused on attracting new customer relationships and deepening relationships with existing customers in part through internal lead generation efforts leveraging data analytics capabilities total deposits were billion at december an increase of billion or from december total noninterestbearing demand deposit accounts grew billion or total interestbearing demand deposit accounts grew billion or savings accounts grew billion or and time deposits decreased billion or as mentioned earlier inflows from ppp and government stimulus checks were a significant factor in the deposit growth the significant increase in customer deposits along with the proceeds from the sale of billion in indirect auto loans resulted in a billion reduction in borrowings the reduction in borrowings included the termination of million in fhlb advances that had a rate of finally our cash held at the frb was billion at december an increase of billion as we shifted from a federal funds purchased position of billion at december to an excess cash position held at the frb at december fnbpa has significant unused wholesale credit availability sources that include the availability to borrow from the fhlb the frb correspondent bank lines access to brokered deposits the ppplf and other channels in addition to credit availability fnbpa also possesses salable unpledged government and agency securities that could be utilized to meet funding needs we currently also have excess cash to meet our pledging requirements the alco is currently targeting a guideline level for salable unpledged government and agency securities due to an elevated influx of related deposits in part related to the ppp combined with a strategic decline of million of investment securities which represents of total assets the following table presents certain information relating to fnbpas credit availability and salable unpledged securities table table start december  in millions unused wholesale credit availability unused wholesale credit availability as a of fnbpa assets salable unpledged government and agency securities salable unpledged government and agency securities as a of fnbpa assets table end the ppplf accounted for of the billion increase in availability since december this funding source has been extended to march we also had million or of total assets in excess cash available to meet our pledging requirements another metric for measuring liquidity risk is the liquidity gap analysis the following liquidity gap analysis as of december compares the difference between our cash flows from existing earning assets and interestbearing liabilities over future time intervals management seeks to limit the size of the liquidity gaps so that sources and uses of funds are reasonably matched in the normal course of business a reasonably matched position lays a better foundation for dealing with additional funding needs during a potential liquidity crisis the twelvemonth cumulative gap to total assets ratio was as of december compared to as of december management calculates this ratio at least quarterly and it is reviewed monthly by alco table table start dollars in millions within month months months months total year assets loans investments liabilities nonmaturity deposits time deposits borrowings period gap assets liabilities cumulative gap cumulative gap to total assets table end in addition the alco regularly monitors various liquidity ratios and stress scenarios of our liquidity position the stress scenarios forecast that adequate funding will be available even under severe conditions management believes we have sufficient liquidity available to meet our normal operating and contingency funding cash needs market risk market risk refers to potential losses arising predominately from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices we are primarily exposed to interest rate risk inherent in our lending and deposittaking activities as a financial intermediary to succeed in this capacity we offer an extensive variety of financial products to meet the diverse needs of our customers these products sometimes contribute to interest rate risk for us when product groups do not complement one another for example depositors may want shortterm deposits while borrowers may desire longterm loans changes in market interest rates may result in changes in the fair value of our financial instruments cash flows and net interest income subject to its ongoing oversight the board of directors has given alco the responsibility for market risk management which involves devising policy guidelines risk measures and limits and managing the amount of interest rate risk and its effect on net interest income and capital we use derivative financial instruments for interest rate risk management purposes and not for trading or speculative purposes interest rate risk is comprised of repricing risk basis risk yield curve risk and options risk repricing risk arises from differences in the cash flow or repricing between asset and liability portfolios basis risk arises when asset and liability portfolios are related to different market rate indices which do not always change by the same amount yield curve risk arises when asset and liability portfolios are related to different maturities on a given yield curve when the yield curve changes shape the risk position is altered options risk arises from embedded options within asset and liability products as certain borrowers have the option to prepay their loans which may be with or without penalty when rates fall while certain depositors can redeem their certificates of deposit early which may be with or without penalty when rates rise we use an assetliability model to measure our interest rate risk interest rate risk measures we utilize include earnings simulation eve and gap analysis gap analysis and eve are static measures that do not incorporate assumptions regarding future business gap analysis while a helpful diagnostic tool displays cash flows for only a single rate environment eves longterm horizon helps identify changes in optionality and longerterm positions however eves liquidation perspective does not translate into the earningsbased measures that are the focus of managing and valuing a going concern net interest income simulations explicitly measure the exposure to earnings from changes in market rates of interest in these simulations our current financial position is combined with assumptions regarding future business to calculate net interest income under various hypothetical rate scenarios the alco reviews earnings simulations over multiple years under various interest rate scenarios on a periodic basis reviewing these various measures provides us with a comprehensive view of our interest rate risk profile which provides the basis for balance sheet management strategies the following repricing gap analysis as of december compares the difference between the amount of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities subject to repricing over a period of time management utilizes the repricing gap analysis as a diagnostic tool in managing net interest income and eve risk measures table table start dollars in millions within month months months months total year assets loans investments liabilities nonmaturity deposits time deposits borrowings offbalance sheet period gap assets liabilities offbalance sheet cumulative gap cumulative gap to assets table end the twelvemonth cumulative repricing gap to total assets was and as of december and respectively the positive cumulative gap positions indicate that we have a greater amount of repricing earning assets than repricing interestbearing liabilities over the subsequent twelve months if interest rates increase as modeled net interest income will increase and conversely if interest rates decrease as modeled net interest income will decrease the change in the cumulative repricing gap at december compared to december is primarily related to growth and changes in the mix of loans deposits and borrowings strong commercial loan growth a large portion of which was swapped to adjustable rates and the increased cash flow from the loan and investment portfolios were partially offset by growth in and repricing of certain interestbearing nonmaturity deposit balances and the repayment of fhlb advances the funding and redemption of both fixed and adjustable borrowings that were swapped to a fixed rate was opportunistically transacted to take advantage of the lower interest rate environment and add liquidity to support loan growth the allocation of nonmaturity deposits and customer repurchase agreements to the onemonth maturity category above is based on the estimated sensitivity of each product to changes in market rates for example if a products rate is estimated to increase by as much as the market rates then of the account balance was placed in this category utilizing net interest income simulations the following net interest income metrics were calculated using rate shocks which move market rates in an immediate and parallel fashion the variance percentages represent the change between the net interest income and eve calculated under the particular rate scenario compared to the net interest income and eve that was calculated assuming market rates as of december using a static balance sheet structure the measures do not reflect all of managements potential counteractions the following table presents an analysis of the potential sensitivity of our net interest income and eve to changes in interest rates using rate shocks table table start december alco limits net interest income change months basis points na basis points basis points basis points economic value of equity basis points basis points basis points basis points table end we also model rate scenarios which move all rates gradually over twelve months rate ramps and model scenarios that gradually change the shape of the yield curve assuming a static balance sheet a basis point rate ramp increases net interest income months by and at december and respectively the corresponding metrics for a minus basis point rate ramp are and at december and respectively the frbs rapid and large downward interest rate moves in march as a response to the covid19 pandemic lowered all market interest rates specifically 1month libor thirtyfive percent of our loans are indexed to onemonth libor further the yield curve flattened these factors were the primary drivers of the increase in asset sensitivity off of a lower base net interest income in this historically low rate environment our strategy is to remain asset sensitive there are multiple factors that influence our interest rate risk position and impact net interest income these include external factors such as the shape of the yield curve and expectations regarding future interest rates as well as internal factors regarding product offerings product mix and pricing of loans and deposits management utilizes various tactics to achieve our desired interest rate risk irr position in response to the change in interest rates management was proactive in addressing our irr position as mentioned earlier we were successful in growing our transaction deposits which provides funding that is less interest ratesensitive than shortterm time deposits and wholesale borrowings also we were able to lower rates on deposit products and shorten the term of the certificates of deposit volumes this continues to be an intense focus of management further during the second half of the year management took advantage of the interest rate environment to reduce borrowing costs on the lending side we regularly sell longterm fixedrate residential mortgages to the secondary market and have been successful in the origination of consumer and commercial loans with shortterm repricing characteristics in particular we have made use of interest rate swaps to commercial borrowers commercial swaps to manage our irr position as the commercial swaps effectively increase adjustablerate loans total variable and adjustablerate loans were and of total loans as of december and respectively as of december of these loans or of total loans are tied to the prime or onemonth libor rates as of december the commercial swaps totaled billion of notional principal with billion in original notional swap principal originated during for additional information regarding interest rate swaps see note derivative and hedging activities to the financial statements in this report the investment portfolio is also used in part to manage our irr position we recognize that all assetliability models have some inherent shortcomings assetliability models require certain assumptions to be made such as prepayment rates on interestearning assets and repricing impact on nonmaturity deposits which may differ from actual experience these business assumptions are based upon our experience business plans economic and market trends and available industry data while management believes that its methodology for developing such assumptions is reasonable there can be no assurance that modeled results will be achieved furthermore the metrics are based upon the balance sheet structure as of the valuation date and do not reflect the planned growth or management actions that could be taken risk management as a financial institution we take on a certain amount of risk in every business decision transaction and activity our board of directors and senior management have identified seven major categories of risk credit risk market risk liquidity risk reputational risk operational risk legal and compliance risk and strategic risk in its oversight role of our risk management function the board of directors focuses on the strategies analyses and conclusions of management relating to identifying understanding and managing risks so as to optimize total shareholder value while balancing prudent business and safety and soundness considerations the board of directors adopted a risk appetite statement that defines acceptable risk levels and limits under which we seek to operate in order to optimize returns as such the board monitors a series of kris or key risk indicators for various business lines operational units and risk categories providing insight into how our performance aligns with our stated risk appetite these results are reviewed periodically by the board of directors and senior management to ensure adherence to our risk appetite statement and where appropriate adjustments are made to applicable business strategies and tactics where risks are approaching stated tolerances or for emerging risks we support our risk management process through a governance structure involving our board of directors and senior management the joint risk committee of our board of directors and the fnbpa board of directors helps ensure that business decisions are executed within appropriate risk tolerances the risk committee has oversight responsibilities with respect to the following identification measurement assessment and monitoring of enterprisewide risk development of appropriate and meaningful risk metrics to use in connection with the oversight of our businesses and strategies review and assessment of our policies and practices to manage our credit market liquidity legal regulatory and operating risk including technology operational compliance and fiduciary risks and identification and implementation of risk management best practices the risk committee serves as the primary point of contact between our board of directors and the risk management council which is the senior management level committee responsible for risk management risk appetite is an integral element of our business and capital planning processes through our board risk committee and risk management council we use our risk appetite processes to promote appropriate alignment of risk capital and performance tactics while also considering risk capacity and appetite constraints from both financial and nonfinancial risks our topdown risk appetite process serves as a limit for undue risktaking for bottomup planning from our various business functions our board risk committee in collaboration with our risk management council approves our risk appetite on an annual basis or more frequently as needed to reflect changes in the risk regulatory economic and strategic plan environments with the goal of ensuring that our risk appetite remains consistent with our strategic plans and business operations regulatory environment and our shareholders expectations reports relating to our risk appetite and strategic plans and our ongoing monitoring thereof are regularly presented to our various management level risk oversight and planning committees and periodically reported up through our board risk committee as noted above we have a risk management council comprised of senior management the purpose of this committee is to provide regular oversight of specific areas of risk with respect to the level of risk and risk management structure management has also established an operational risk committee that is responsible for identifying evaluating and monitoring operational risks across fnb evaluating and approving appropriate remediation efforts to address identified operational risks and providing periodic reports concerning operational risks to the risk management council the risk management council reports on a regular basis to the risk committee of our board of directors regarding our enterprisewide risk profile and other significant risk management issues our chief risk officer is responsible for the design and implementation of our enterprisewide risk management strategy and framework through the multiple second line of defense areas including the following departments enterprisewide risk management fraud risk loan review model risk management thirdparty risk management antimoney laundering and bank secrecy act cra appraisal

various business and emergency continuity plans to respond to different crises and circumstances which include rapid deployment of our crisis management team incident management team and business continuity coordinators to activate our plans for various types of emergency circumstance further our audit function performs an independent assessment of our internal controls environment and plays an integral role in testing the operation of the internal controls systems and reporting findings to management and our audit committee each of the risk audit credit risk and cra committees of our board of directors regularly report on riskrelated matters to the full board of directors in addition both the risk committee of our board of directors and our risk management council regularly assess our enterprisewide risk profile and provide guidance on actions needed to address key and emerging risk issues the board of directors believes that our enterprisewide risk management process is effective and enables the board of directors to assess the quality of the information they receive understand the businesses investments and financial accounting legal regulatory and strategic considerations and the risks that fnb faces oversee and assess how senior management evaluates risk and assess appropriately the quality of our enterprisewide risk management process reconciliations
