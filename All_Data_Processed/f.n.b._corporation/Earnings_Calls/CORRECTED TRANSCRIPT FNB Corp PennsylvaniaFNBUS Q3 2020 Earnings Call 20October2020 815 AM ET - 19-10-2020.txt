more detail on asset quality gary l guerrieri chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you vince and good morning everyone during the third quarter our credit portfolio continued to perform in a satisfactory manner as we continued to work through this challenging economic environment our key credit metrics have held up well with some slight increases noted during the quarter related to the covid environment that is largely tied to borrowers in the hardest hit industries which we have built loan loss reserves for accordingly i will now walk you through our results for the third quarter followed by an update on our loan deferrals and some of the proactive steps we are taking to manage the book lets now discuss some key highlights during the third quarter delinquency came in at a good level of an increase of bps over the prior quarter that was predominantly covidrelated tied to mortgage forbearances while the commercial portfolio remained relatively level with the prior quarter when excluding ppp loan volume delinquency would have ended the quarter at the level of npls and oreo totaled basis points a 4basis point increase linkedquarter while the nongaap level excluding ppp loans stands at bps this slight migration is attributable to some covidimpacted credits that were placed on nonaccrual during the quarter which is in line with our proactive risk management measures that we have in place to help identify potential pockets of softness of our total nonperforming loans at september continued to pay on a current basis net chargeoffs came in at million for the quarter or basis points annualized with the increase largely due to writedowns taken against a few covidimpacted credits that were already showing weakness entering the pandemic fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 on a yeartodate basis our gaap net chargeoffs stood at basis points through the end of the third quarter provision expense totaled million which includes additional build for covidrelated credit migration driven by the hotel and restaurant portfolios bringing our total ending reserve to when excluding ppp loan volume the nongaap acl stands at a 7basis point linkedquarter increase our npl coverage remains favorable at at quarterend which reflects the reserve build for the covid driven credit migration during the quarter when including the acquired unamortized loan discounts our reserve position excluding ppp loan volume is we continue to conduct a series of scenario analyses and stress test models under our existing allowance and dfast frameworks as we work through this covidimpacted environment under the final severely adverse dfast scenario the current reserve position inclusive of unamortized loan discounts would cover of stressed losses which does not include losses already incurred yeartodate as it relates to our borrowers requesting payment deferral of our total loan portfolio excluding ppp balances were under a covidrelated deferment plan at quarterend with remaining first requests representing of the portfolio and being second deferrals as of october total deferrals have further declined by approximately million to stand at we continue to carefully monitor the credit portfolio as the pandemic evolves and borrowers work to overcome the uncertainty and challenging conditions that many currently face our exposure to highly sensitive industries remains low at of the total portfolio which includes all borrowers operating in the travel and leisure food services and energy space with deferrals granted to these borrowers totaling driven primarily by the hotel portfolio as we continue to work through these hardest hit sectors during the quarter we conducted another thorough deep dive credit review of our commercial borrowers operating in these economicallysensitive industries which was led by our seasoned and experienced credit officer team our portfolio review covered over of our existing credit exposure in covidsensitive portfolios including travel and leisure food services and retailrelated ci and ire as part of our review process we assess the adequacy of cash flow strength of the sponsors backing the deals the collateral position and direct feedback from borrowers about their expected short and longterm outlooks this level of review has helped us to quickly identify potential credit deterioration and take appropriate action as we did during  to better position us for the quarters ahead should this challenging economic environment continue in closing we are pleased with the position of our portfolio entering the final quarter of relative to where we are in this covidimpacted economic environment our credit metrics have held up well and continue to trend at satisfactory levels as we remain focused on proactively identifying risk in the portfolio and aggressively working through it the experience and depth of our credit and lending teams have been paramount to our success and i would like to recognize these groups for their tireless efforts each and every day as we work through these challenging conditions i will now turn the call over to vince calabrese our chief financial officer for his remarks vincent j calabrese chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks gary good morning everyone now well discuss our financial results and review the recent actions taken that have enhanced our overall balance sheet positioning reduced interest rate risk and boosted capital fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 levels as noted on slide third quarter operating eps totaled consistent with the prior quarter the level of ppnr remained solid and we continue to proactively manage our overall reserve position with provision expense totaling million we feel good about the strength of the balance sheet and our current level of reserves based on what we know today after a comprehensive review of our loan portfolio additionally the quarters results reflect the continued execution of our strategies focused on prudent risk management supported by our recent actions for example during the third quarter we took proactive measures to strengthen capital and reduce credit risk we signed an agreement to sell million of lower fico indirect auto loans to close in  with the proceeds being used to pay down a similar amount of highcost federal home loan bank borrowings of which million with a rate of was prepaid this quarter for a breakage fee of million we also sold visa class b shares at a million gain to fully mitigate the capital impact of the fhlb breakage costs resulting transactions should add roughly basis points to cet improve credit risk and be neutral to run rate earnings we continue to strengthen riskbased capital levels with our cet ratio increasing to at the end of the quarter as i just noted the pro forma cet ratio will increase by another basis points after considering the impact of the upcoming loan sale the pro forma cet ratio marks the highest level in our history and would be in line with peer median levels from the most recent filings our improved capital levels give us additional flexibility that is important at this stage of the economic cycle looking at our tce ratio we ended september comfortably above increasing to which translates when excluding ppp loans on the expense front we are progressing well toward achieving our cost savings goal reducing run rate expenses via optimizing our branch network and reducing operational costs through ongoing vendor contract renegotiations on the revenue front we are leveraging our new geographies to drive market share gains and feebased businesses notably mortgage banking capital markets wealth and insurance to offset net interest margin pressure in the current low rate environment lets now shift to the balance sheet indiscernible spot balances total loans were relatively flat compared to the prior quarter excluding the transfer of million of indirect auto loans to heldforsale looking ahead its important to focus on the position of the balance sheet after the loan sale and excluding ppp we remain focused on driving organic growth as the billion in ppp loans enter the forgiveness process and those balances wind down in the future compared to the second quarter average deposits increased primarily due to growth in interestbearing deposits and growth in noninterestbearing deposits which was partially offset by planned decrease in time deposits as vince noted core deposit growth generated by building on our commercial and consumer relationships remains a focus for us as we eliminated our overnight borrowing position and have ample liquidity to fund future growth objectives lets now look at noninterest income and expense noninterest income reached a record million increasing linked quarter primarily due to significant growth in mortgage banking as well as strong contributions from wealth insurance and capital markets mortgage banking income increased million as total production increased from the prior quarter with sizable contributions from the midatlantic and pittsburgh regions and a meaningful improvement in gain on sale margins wealth management and insurance revenues each increased these segments benefiting from increased organic commercial growth and greater activity in the midatlantic and carolina regions capital markets revenue while down from a record level last quarter was again at a very good level of million with these products fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 continuing to remain an attractive option for borrowers given the environment termination of million of higher rate federal home loan bank borrowings resulted in a loss on debt extinguishment and related hedge termination costs of million reported in other noninterest income offsetting these charges was the million gain on the sale of the banks holdings of visa class b shares also reported in other noninterest income turning to slide sic noninterest expense totaled million an increase of million or which included million of covid19 expenses in the third quarter compared to million in the second quarter excluding these covid19 related expenses noninterest expense increased million or primarily related to higher salaries and employee benefit expense higher productionrelated commissions lower loan origination salary deferrals given the significant ppp loan originations in the prior quarter and an extra operating day in the third quarter fdic insurance decreased million due primarily to a lower fdic assessment rate from improved quality metrics the efficiency ratio equaled compared to which is reflective of the higher productionrelated expenses noted previously looking at revenue net interest income totaled million stable compared to the second quarter as loan and deposit growth mostly offset lower asset yields on variable rate loans tied to the short end of the curve the net interest margin decreased basis points to as the total yield on earning assets declined basis points to reflecting lower yields on fixed rate loans originated at lower rates given the interest rate environment and the impact of a basis point decline in one month libor the benefit of our efforts to optimize funding costs was evident in a basis point reduction in the cost of interestbearing deposits which help to reduce our total cost of funds to basis points down from basis points were very pleased with the performance of our fee based businesses as they have supported revenue growth amidst the current low interest rate environment demonstrating the importance of having diversification turning to our fourth quarter outlook we expect periodend loans to be generally flat from september assuming no forgiveness in ppp loans given the current timing expectations for the sba to process requests while we expect deposits to decline from third quarter levels thats based on an expectation that customers increase their deployment of funds received through the government programs we do expect to see continued organic growth and transaction deposits ill note that our assumptions do not include any further government stimulus programs or actions we expect fourth quarter net interest income to be down slightly from third quarter inclusive of the impact of the loan sale we are not assuming any ppp forgiveness in the fourth quarter absent the loan sale we would have expected net interest income in the fourth quarter to be flattish we expect continued strong contributions from feebased businesses with a similar level in capital markets and some reduction from record levels of mortgage banking we expect service charges to increase continuing to rebound given recent transaction volume trends looking at fee income overall we expect total noninterest income to be in the mid to high70 million range we expect expenses to be stable to up slightly from the third quarter excluding covid19 expenses of million we expect the effective tax rate to be around for the full year lastly we are currently in the early stages of budgeting for similar to and we will again seek to have meaningful cost saving initiatives building on consecutive years of taking million out of our overall cost structure that support strategic investments and manage the impact of the low interest rate environment weve taken considerable effort to bring our efficiency ratio down from over in the past to the low to mid50 levels we have been operating at currently in addition to the scale gain from prior acquisitions we have consolidated close to branches in the past five years which is about of our current branch network weve always been discipline managers of costs and it fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 will be an important driver to return us to a position of generating positive operating leverage and mitigate growth and expenses in we will share more details when we provide detailed guidance in january overall we are pleased with the performance of the quarter in a very challenging environment next vince will give an update on some of our strategic initiatives in vincent j delie jr chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks vince now id like to focus on our progress regarding key strategic initiatives since our last call in our consumer base we continue to focus on optimizing our delivery channels the deployment of our new website has translated into higher digital adoption through increased website traffic increased mobile deposits and exponential growth in the number of online appointments in the current environment customer activity trends continue to shift towards digital channels with mobile enrollment up compared to averages in fact we have seen both monthly average mobile and online users increase by each compared with the average levels regarding website traffic monthly visitors are up nearly looking at our physical delivery channel we continue to execute our established lending program to optimize our branch network which included more than consolidations since may of making fnb one of the more active banks for branch consolidation we will continue to thoroughly evaluate additional consolidation opportunities as well as select de novo expansion across our footprint as consumer behaviors evolve we recently announced plans to develop additional de novo locations which will enhance our retail strategy and support our corporate banking efforts in this attractive new market for example our charleston branches are performing exceptionally well with nearly million of deposit growth compared to and these branches are currently ranked among the upper quartile for performance compared to fnbs entire retail network this consumer growth works in tandem with our successful corporate banking efforts as the charleston region has grown nicely with our south carolina commercial loan balances approaching million at the end of september we recently brought the wholesale bank and respective credit teams back into the offices on a rotational basis as we remain steadfast in supporting our customers while building momentum to carry into the next year given the impact from the government stimulus programs customers have increased liquidity with lower commercial line utilization rate a more normal environment offers upside moving into our model is built on local decision making and the high touch relationship based approach coupled with consistent investment in technology this has served us well during the pandemic where our local bankers are in the market and working closely with our customers as weve built out certain highvalue feebased businesses such as treasury management and capital market weve embedded local specialists across all markets to support our commercial bankers efforts during this pandemic where travel physical mobility and facetoface interaction is limited having wellinformed decision makers directly located in our market enables fnb to best support our customers together with our efforts in the wholesale bank fnb has also benefited from our longterm consumer strategy clicks to bricks by investing heavily in our digital platform one key element necessary for fnb to continue to deliver attractive returns for our shareholders is our commitment to our employees i am pleased to share that fnb was included for a 10th consecutive year as a fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 greater pittsburgh area top workplace by the pittsburgh postgazette signifying the strength of our culture with a decade of excellence and consistency these results benefit our shareholders and we would like to recognize the hard work and dedication of all of our employees who have made these results possible with that ill turn the call over to the operator operator question and answer section operator yes thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions and the first question comes from frank schiraldi with piper sandler frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies thanks just first on the nim mechanics vince you talk about a flattish nim next quarter obviously it sounds like no ppp forgiveness so i guess ppp will still be there and negatively impacting the margin i guess but just trying to think through the moving parts think about reinvestment rates for securities going lower is there more room on the deposit side and then this purchase accounting accretion how does that play into the quarterly progression vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania sure frank i would say a few things the ppp is actually slightly additive to the margin by a few basis points when you include the fees that are being accreted in so as far as the kind of the lookforward to the fourth quarter im looking at the third quarter kind of being a bottom here so kind of flattish from there libor has been stable basis points really the spot beginning and end of the quarter was within basis point of each other so i think libor being stable from here helps theres still more room on the interestbearing deposit costs side as we had in the slide we brought it down basis points to basis points the spot at the end of the quarter was basis points so youre kind of basis points ahead as a starting point and then we would expect kind of another basis points a month improvement in the fourth quarter so kind of to basis points additional reduction in the cost of interestbearing deposits in the fourth quarter overall kind of supporting the margin and then the other dynamic is just you have loans coming on at new loans coming on at lower rates just given where rates are so kind of if you run it all together it gets you to the flattish comment that we had in the prepared remarks there frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies got you okay and then just in terms of the balance sheet actions i get if you can accrue capital and theres really no impact to earnings it seems like a win in terms of providing more flexibility but just wondering if we should read anything more into the increase in capital level i mean you guys have always sought to operate with pretty streamlined capital so is there any change to where you think or any pressures general pressures on the industry to where you think ratios need to go to and could there be additional actions to get there vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 no theres no change weve been saying for at least the last year that weve been more actively looking at the asset side of the balance sheet and considering different options to kind of just optimize the balance sheet position and the capital position so nothing underlining that other than weve been looking at indirect for a while potentially securitizing or selling a portion of the portfolio were remaining in that business so well continue to generate new assets as we go forward but it was just kind of planets aligning there was a good opportunity to sell that at basically a slight gain and then its a boost to capital ratios basis points to cet1 about basis points to the tce ratio in a nondilutive manner just felt like a good smart thing to do right now and then as we kind of come through and get more certainty about the economic environment and where everybody is going theres opportunity for us to restart the share buyback program and this gives us some powder to do that so its really just looking at the opportunity that presented itself and then we also had we had the gain to visa class b shares that weve been monitoring for a while became very attractive so we could sell those payoff some home loans borrowings that were at rate kind of helping the run rate earnings going forward so it just kind of made sense economically to do that and again like i said it creates more powder for share buybacks goforward frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies okay great and then just really quick if i could just ask gary do you provide or would you provide where criticized and classified the trend from into gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah let me walk you through that frank as i mentioned in my remarks we conducted another really deepdive review of the borrowers operating in the hardest hit covidsensitive industries and we really looked at about billion of the total portfolio pulling in a few other credits that may be slightly impacted we wanted to be proactive in building reserves where appropriate against these hardest hit borrowers under the current economic environment and this review was important from the banks perspective really a handful of our senior group reviewed these relationships with our regional credit officers one by one over a fourday period to really assess these uptodate positions on each borrower and we took aggressive risk rating actions against the covidimpacted portfolios primarily the hotel and restaurant portfolio and we moved about million of that into classified and about million into special mention were essentially migrating about of the hotel portfolio and about of the restaurant portfolio to prudently build reserves against these pieces of business that are impacted by the covid economy just finishing up here in total we also included some retail ire we built during that quarter million of the total million provision against these portfolios so it was pretty meaningful piece which we felt was the prudent thing to do overall when we look at these industries and building these reserves and reviewed these credits we were really pleased with the positions of the majority of the borrowers across the space and we remain confident theyll weather the storm fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 finally on deferrals the deferrals are heaviest in the hotel space as you would expect right at about restaurants are very low at this point only and retail ire only so overall pleased with that review and the reserve positioning that we were able to accomplish during the quarter frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies great thanks for all the detail gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks frank vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks frank operator thank you and the next question comes from casey haire with jefferies casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah thanks good morning guys couple of questions on the ppnr front first off housekeeping the purchase accounting adjustment in the quarter how much was that vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah the pcd accretion was million in the third quarter just for reference it was million in the second quarter casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay excellent and then so the outlook looks like revenues youre calling for revenues to be down obviously mortgage banking was very strong and normalization is to be expected but im just curious why wouldnt expense whats keeping the expenses stable to slightly higher why wouldnt we see leverage in the fourth quarter vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania well i think in the fourth quarter you typically have certain things at the end of the year you have well first of all mortgage is still going to be strong in the fourth quarter so were going to have commissionrelated expense that will be accounted at a heavy level again corresponding with the revenue of course yeah its kind of just at the end of the year depending on all the different business units and how they close out the year so kind of thats a component you typically see in the fourth quarter so theres nothing unusual there were managing costs as weve talked about earlier in the year we basically removed million from our overall cost structure for the last two years with the goal to reach a threeyear level fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 of million so we took million out last year were going to take million out this year and thats kind of been a process throughout the year through a combination of branch optimization continued renegotiating the contract process improvement and everything that we do every day so those efforts are continuing and helping to pay for kind of some of the investments and the strategic initiatives so really just kind of normal activity casey in addition to those items casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay very good and just so the hotel book the hotel and lodging book no specifically the hotel book the apologies if i missed this how much did of the charge offs were driven by the hotel books and then what is the what do we expect in terms of loss trajectory going forward from the current level in the third quarter here and as well as deferral strategy specifically for the hotel book just given half of it is in still in deferral gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah in terms of the charge offs casey the chargeoffs were just a little over million in that portfolio and as we look forward i mean were going to continue to work with those borrowers we were pleased with the review of that book of business as i mentioned some of those borrowers are going to have a tougher time than others and well work through those particular accounts thats why we built some reserve against that portfolio i mean its the hardest hit industry under this covid economy that we have seen so well take appropriate actions as we move through the fourth quarter and manage it accordingly there was only one new nonaccrual during the quarter in that book of business and we reviewed every credit over million so that gives you a feel for where we sit at the moment and well continue to stay ahead of that portfolio as we move forward casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay very good and just last one gary i think you mentioned or maybe its vince the indirect auto portfolio that youre selling you do expect to sell that at a gain and so theres no that can be a loss or theres no reserves built on that portfolio vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania no it actually came in we were able to sell a little bit better than what we expected because theres reserves and all kinds of things on the books here so we were able to sell it at kind of a slight premium to par and then you have the reserve component of it also no it was the execution was better than kind of what we were going in with casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay so im sorry so with that that portfolio has already been sold or i thought it was due to be closed in november vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah its in heldofsale casey no youre right its in heldforsale its all executed as of yesterday itll close in the fourth quarter but its in the heldforsale bucket on the balance sheet at fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 casey haire q analyst jefferies llc understood thank you vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania sure operator thank you and the next question comes from michael young with truist securities michael young q analyst truist securities hey thanks for taking the question what is the start on kind of expenses as a followup youve kind of mentioned the million of additional cost saves that were kind of already targeted for obviously the revenue environment is going to be challenging and some headwinds still on that kind of yearoveryear basis so you expect more of those cost saves to drop to the bottom line next year or is it better to think about it in terms of efficiency ratio next year and you guys just maintain a positive operating leverage so efficiency ratio should be stable to better vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would say i mean we continue to have some strategic initiatives that weve been working on during the year upgrading our teller platform and the system and the branches are fixed ph with our cost initiative so i think that the kind of cost savings goal for next year will be to mitigate any increase in expenses with the goal of getting back to generating positive operating leverage like you said i think thats a key goal for us its been in the past and our goal is to well return to that so i mean it clearly goes to the bottom line right because its going to offset other cost increases so theres clearly an ph eps benefit to that and were in the early stages of our budgeting process michael so its were going to be talking about it in detail and coming up with kind of a list of the items like we have in the past so in january we will freshen up i guess the outlook for next year once we finish that process but theres the goal to like i said get a threeyear level with million and then well finish the process and share any more information we have in january and i think its important too that weve i mentioned in my prepared remarks we closed branches over the last five years of the network and well continue to look at optimizing the network and customer behaviors have changed as were in this pandemic and some of that will be permanent some of it may not we dont know yet but well continue to look we still have a lot of branches well continue to look at some opportunities there to kind of optimize the overall network and see how customer behaviors come out of the pandemic michael young q analyst truist securities thats helpful and maybe this is more a question for vince d but i guess over the last year or two you guys have done a good bit of reinvestment in terms of the digital initiatives new branch openings etcetera so it seems like maybe a lot of thats behind you so there wouldnt be more of an opportunity for some cost saves to drop to the bottom line but i guess i juxtapose that against the new branches in charleston etcetera that have fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 obviously been doing well and so just kind of generally trying to think about your thoughts there on reinvestment and new initiatives versus maybe just taking a pause or breather on some of that stuff vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i think we developed a longer term view so were in the second cycle of our threeyear strategic planning process we map out our capex investment in technology so we sit together discuss where we want to be at a future point then we devise budgets our capex budget and then we layer it into our forecast so we what that does is it requires us to cover those investments on an ongoing basis which we have and thats what youre pointing out in your statement i think that were in really good position as we move forward to continue executing our plan were going to continue to add elements to our digital offering soon well be able to originate a whole variety of loans on our website weve pretty much completed the depositary side were moving on to the loan side and then the third piece of it are the feebased businesses that will also be integrated into that digital platform what that does for us is it gives us the ability to market our banking services products and services globally without physical presence and open accounts endtoend on our platform and if you looked at our website youll see that weve changed the format of the website its very unique its a very unique experience where you can put multiple products into a shopping cart and then purchase multiple products at one time our goal is to continue to streamline that process for the consumer so that they only need to fill out one application and they can open ph bulk loan and depositary products or other products in a very streamlined fashion the interactions with the customer base relative to the ppp has significantly amplified the exposure to our website so the number of clicks on our website has gone up as i said exponentially thats very helpful for us because weve embedded digital content into our website about those products and services so people can shop around use the help me decide tools buy other products other than just depositary products or schedule appointments we mentioned appointment scheduling that was all done prior to the pandemic so as we move through this and we started to everyone was kind of forced into using a digital environment that played very well for us thats why our deposit balances are up our market share is up in a number of markets weve had really great success with appointment setting throughout the pandemic we received numerous awards about our response to the pandemic and we significantly outperformed larger banks just about any bank in the first round of ppp with an capture rate we set up everything in our with the digital with our digital channel with a portal and basically it was an endtoend process that was fully digital like very few banks were able to do that so i think were in a position where we can start to leverage that as we get through the pandemic and deal with the pandemic i would not read into our decisions to bolster capital i think thats been something weve stated even prior to the pandemic we felt that particularly cet we could improve that increase our levels relative to peers now were at the peer median i think on a pro forma basis so weve come a long way the actions that we took with the portfolio made complete sense it was a very good move for us because it bolstered capital we did not impair our earnings capacity moving into next year and it gives us flexibility from a capital perspective to buy back shares to do whatever so it opens the door for us and thats been a stated objective so i would not read into it we have no pressure at all to change our operating strategy at this point fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 anyway i think there is an opportunity i think if you look at the fdic data there were we were moving in the right direction even before the influx of ppp deposits our noninterestbearing deposits are up substantially i know the industry has experienced an inflow but weve consistently built our lowcost deposit base over time so were approaching the upper range in terms of lowcost deposits relative to the total were or so i think all of those things continue to move in the right direction and the markets that we moved in i was just down in the carolinas theres a lot more activity in the carolinas in general with hospitality with restaurants even the industries that are being impacted theres much more activity than there is in the midwest or the northeast anyway thats the answer sorry for the long answer michael young q analyst truist securities no thats okay those are good overview and maybe just one last one for me for gary just i think it was asked before kind of about the maybe the timing of chargeoffs or resolution of some of these credits is there any sort of update or thoughts in your mind on when some of these may kind of come to resolution is that first half of or will there be extensions and restructurings that might kind of draw it out over a longer period next year gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would say michael as you know were very proactive in not kicking the can down the road i mean we aggressively address problem credits and manage them and try to move them if possible in terms of expected losses i think weve talked in the past a little bit about industry losses moving upwards as you move into and through so i would expect that to occur i would looking at the industry in  state that youll probably see losses start to increase at that point based on the environment that were in but i think youll see those accumulate through michael young q analyst truist securities okay thanks operator thank you and the next question comes from russell gunther with da davidson russell e t gunther q analyst da davidson co hey good morning guys vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning russell russell e t gunther q analyst da davidson co just wanted to follow up on the auto sales so makes a ton of sense and theres a culture of derisking at fnb wondering if theres opportunity for continued optimization without sacrificing much in the way of earnings power fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 or was the deepdive review that you guys did in the portfolio this quarter really ringfenced this opportunity and we should consider this more of a oneoff move vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would say were always evaluating also as you know opportunities if theres things that come to light that make sense to us that are in the best interest of the shareholders and makes good financial sense well do it so were always looking at all the different elements of the balance sheet and here this quarter we had an opportunity to like i said was kind of planets lining up to pull some things together and make a smart financial decision that helps boost capital and give you some buffer going forward and like i said creates the ability to buy back shares so well continue to look and there may be other opportunities as we go down the road so kind of a quarterbyquarter thing russell e t gunther q analyst da davidson co any portfolios in particular where you think you might have a better opportunity as you would continue to analyze that vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania no but i russell i think were going to look from a risk perspective as well as the commercial book weve sold mortgage loans in the past we sold regency so we got out of consumer finance at the right time i think were going to continue to evaluate what we have in our portfolio were going to look at returns on those assets and were going to look at the risk profile associated with holding those assets long term and we get together and we make decisions about moving certain assets off the balance sheet i think weve done it very effectively and i think gary and his team have done a great job of and gary and the whole credit team has done a great job of addressing future risks russell e t gunther q analyst da davidson co yes i really gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania and well continue to russell e t gunther q analyst da davidson co i appreciate your thoughts gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania continue to assess that on a quarterly basis russ as we always do vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 yeah our goal is to get through this so that were in a really strong position on the other side of it so understand that were were here managing through this situation we understand with a great degree of clarity what we face i think weve addressed various elements of it very successfully and were going to continue to position the company so that were in a position of strength post pandemic crisis the economic side of the pandemic crisis russell e t gunther q analyst da davidson co thanks very much guys i appreciate your thoughts gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania all right russell thanks vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks operator thank you and the next question comes from collyn gilbert with kbw collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning guys gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania indiscernible collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc maybe if you could just start with a little bit of discussion around kind of a loan pipeline and what the sentiment is of your commercial borrower right now kind of how theyre thinking about their businesses when you think maybe they start to reinvest in the business and then also to just some color from a geographic perspective if youre seeing wide variances from your carolinas franchises versus what youre seeing kind of in the pennsylvania ohio markets vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i think the commercial borrowers and gary can answer as well the commercial borrowers have been a little more conservative were in an election year theres a lot of things that can potentially change relative to their businesses weve just gone through were still going through the pandemic so its not over yet so i think theres been a little bit of caution in terms of capital investment we are just talking about that before the call started so that puts a little bit of damper on loan demand but theres still a lot of conversation i would say that most of the industries that have not been directly impacted by covid are performing okay or pretty well so remarkably the economy outside of those industries are obviously directly impacted gary mentioned hospitality the fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 restaurant businesses they were impacted pretty heavily but i think that as you look at the book theres a certain degree of optimism within that customer base that were going to get through this and things arent so bad when you look at utilization rates online the utilization rate for us is down now we have a more middle market to small business customer base so theyve benefited from ppp funding and other subsidies or other opportunities to reduce their working capital facilities because theyre not investing as heavily in inventory or other cash consuming assets but i think that when you look at it were running at a point where theres some upside as the economy starts to turn around i think and geographically the manufacturing sector is kind of flattish theyre starting to see improvement so the midwest and the northeast is probably lagging a little bit the south as we look into the carolinas raleigh has a very strong pipeline charlotte is starting to see more activity charleston i mentioned in my prepared comments has done exceptionally well and continues to see opportunities there continues to be a migration of people into the charleston msa i mean theyre adding people a day mostly from the northeast so theres opportunities there from a mortgage perspective or retail banking perspective and with businesses theres business formation in that market so it seems to be pretty active weve expanded our commercial activities in asheville north carolina and greenville so were starting to see some good activity there the carolinas are really doing well and id say the midwest and the northeast has been relatively stable for us both from a credit perspective and a growth perspective i dont know if gary do you want to add anything gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah collyn as vince mentioned the borrowers are facing a lot of uncertainty at the moment the election actually has them thinking and theyve been on hold with it for a little while in many cases the pandemic still continuing also is on their on the top of their minds so those two major uncertainties are critical to their investment going forward that being said as vince mentioned also some of the borrowers are doing extremely well even in this environment and are investing today some are on hold the commercial line utilization rate has reached an alltime low were now at so that continues to reflect the borrowers decisions to vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania pay down debt gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania pay down debt go to cash and to handle some of this uncertainty from a conservative standpoint so i think theyre approaching it directly but what it tells me is on the back side of this theres a lot of opportunity for the industry going forward from a loan demand and a growth perspective so were looking forward to getting on the back side of it collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats helpful and then just gary a question for you i appreciate all the color that youre giving us on kind of net chargeoffs unfortunately its a component of our models that we have to be models are a lot more fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 precision now obviously given cecl so which is probably why were asking a lot of questions on net charge offs but just in terms of so let me ask as you look out in terms of potential losses is it safe to say that you do see greater nearterm pressure mostly just on the covidrelated segments are you not seeing cracks or are you not anticipating kind of outsized losses maybe in the other segments of the book gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania i would tell you collyn that the book is holding up very nicely were very pleased with the performance of it the softness as weve discussed today is really in that covidsensitive area the hotels the restaurants and as ive mentioned the restaurants were a pleasant surprise to me i sat down with the team over that fourday period and went through these accounts one by one and that total review looked at billion worth of impacted and potentially impacted credits i walked away from that feeling very good and the reserve build that we talked about earlier was in the areas where it needed to be so i think youll see what losses come through i think youll see it in those covidsensitive areas without a doubt and again we think a lot of that book has a lot of positive things happening in it already occupancy levels are up theyre improving a heavy dose of that is in the carolinas we got it through the acquired book and as weve talked those areas are more active so were seeing some positive occupancy levels start to make some headway there so hopefully that helps answer your question but its kind of really concentrated in that covid impacted sector collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay that is and then just one final question on that front do you happen to have what the ltv kind of the average ltv is on your hotel and lodging book kind of a 360someodd million i guess you have isolated gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah youre right at about collyn collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great all right i will leave it there thanks everybody gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks collyn operator thank you and the next question comes from matthew breese with stephens inc fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 matt breese q analyst stephens inc good morning guys gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning matt vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey matt matt breese q analyst stephens inc hey just a few first what was the average balance of ppp loans for the quarter and then do you have the total ppprelated income vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah the average balance is billion for the third quarter and kind of the total net interest income which runs about million a quarter including the coupon at the plus the fees to come in matt breese q analyst stephens inc okay vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania and thats net interest income matt breese q analyst stephens inc and then the million of indirect auto loans what was the yield on that vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania the gross yield was about matt breese q analyst stephens inc okay and then you mentioned potentially selling more of this product could you just give us a sense for the overall origination activity over the course of the last year and if you were to repeat this how much of that would you like to sell versus retain fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah just to clarify i was saying that in the past we have been looking at this asset class for a while as far as potentially securitizing or selling a portion so at this point we dont have any plans to sell any additional slugs of it this was just a result of that review weve been doing over the last year or two so just to clarify that matt breese q analyst stephens inc got it okay and then i know you vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah what it does for us is it weve built out the infrastructuretoservice so it provides us with an opportunity to sell in the future thats i think vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah on a flow basis thats true vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania on a flow basis vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania we did that on a flow basis vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania were going to look at it from an economic perspective whats best for the shareholders from return on capital standpoint thats how we manage it going forward vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania well thats a good point yeah i was referring to kind of a bulk sale but vince is right we have the capacity vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i dont think im not going to suggest that in this environment were going to start ramping up that business were not we just wanted to have the capability to move those assets off the balance sheet efficiently when the pricing is right and the stars align and thats going through this exercise was completing the ability to do that gives us another option in terms of capital management matt breese q analyst stephens inc fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 okay vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania that makes sense matt breese q analyst stephens inc yes no that makes perfect sense and i know you provided some broader fee income guidance and you do expect mortgage to normalize but could you talk a little bit about the capital markets line of business and what the pipeline and activity there looks how repeatable is what you saw this quarter vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i think this quarter was a little more normal than the previous quarters i mean they were just outrageously good because of the steep decline in interest rates really that is it hinges on our ability to originate new volume so as we see the pipeline start to pick up theres opportunity for us to sell derivative products to customers our syndications pipeline looked very solid so thats been generating a decent amount of fee income recently and as we continue to elevate our name our brand in the new markets that were in were seeing more and more opportunities to lead transactions so we would expect that business to continue to grow as we move through the cycle and weve as ive said weve had some great success there recently and we expect that to continue and then theres other areas that were part of our threeyear strategic plan that were essentially building out today so eventually we may provide advisory services both municipal finance and corporate finance advisory services were establishing a brokerdealer to benefit from the income for our larger clients that access debt through the capital markets so there are certain things that were doing that will enhance fee income in the future so itll augment the derivative fee income that we garner thats helpful matt breese q analyst stephens inc yes its very helpful i appreciate it thats all i have i appreciate taking my questions thank you vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania all right thanks gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks matt operator thank you and the next question comes from jared shaw with wells fargo timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 hi good morning this is actually timur braziler filling in for jared just a couple followups for me maybe starting with gary the loan to value in the hotel and lodging portfolio i guess how was that derived im assuming its pretty challenging to do appraisals right now given that cash flows are still impacted so looking at the book gary i guess how comfortable are you with that loan to value and maybe expanding that to the current allowance level as we start seeing some incremental losses flow through in the next few quarters is the expectation that the reserves already established will offset those losses or do you think youre going to have to backfill the allowance account for the new losses coming in over the next couple of quarters gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania well weve built reserves based on the performance of each credit in the position of each credit in that portfolio during the quarter so we essentially went through that entire book timur and positioned it appropriately for where it sits today as mentioned earlier we only moved one account to nonaccrual status during the quarter so thats an account that is in a problem state were working through it right now as we sit here today so i cant speculate on every single asset that may or may not default in that book but at this point as i mentioned earlier we feel good about the review and there are some credits in there that are a little more challenged than others but overall it was a positive view of that book of business some of them will default for certain under the environment that were in as far as the ltv its based on the ltvs at the original underwriting so you would expect that to come down over time at weve got a fairly good cushion going in to those things so when you look at potential defaults in that book and that kind of expected reduction in valuation the loss content on the defaulted ones should be minimal but there will be loss content on those assets that are not able to continue timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thats a good color and thank you and then just last one from me looking at the commercial real estate growth in the quarter i guess what industries are you seeing strength in there and as you look ahead is the expectation that balances climb higher or should we expect some sort of retrenchment given how impact of some of the cle verticals remain gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i mean weve seen some strength in the commercial and industrial space multifamily has held up well and warehouse as well so those are kind of the segments were not seeing a lot of new activity in the multifamily space by any means but its primarily that commercial and industrial warehouse where we have seen some activity timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you for the color gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania sure thing fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania timur thanks operator thank you and the next question comes from brian martin with janney montgomery brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey good morning guys vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania hi brian gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey brian brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey just one question back to capital for a minute on that where do things stand in the buyback given the conversation this quarter vince about the pickup on the pro forma capital levels just as you think about that vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania i think just looking for some more clarity about the environment brian and kind of what youre you feel if theres a kind of light at the end of the tunnel here and more comfortable with where things are going that we would start to resume the share buyback so its in place it was fully authorized were kind of ready to go once it feels like the right time to do it and the stock trading below tangible book value is very attractive so its definitely a trigger we would pull once we just kind of have a little bit more certainty about where everything is going brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay perfect and then how about just i know you said nothing on the ppp forgiveness this quarter just your anticipation of how that plays out or based on what youre seeing with your customers there i mean is it first quarter and second quarter as most of it get done in first quarter your thinking now vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i guess our current thinking based on the sba process would be kind of and this is just our guesstimate really in the first quarter kind of another in the second quarter and then you have a tail kind of at june that we just kind of run down from there but we have vince is commenting on the process we built for the origination side weve also built a portal for the forgiveness side and kind of have that kind of readytogo now with the sba has put out how they want things to work so kind of were going to be ready to go and expect to start submitting those in november and early part of november but the practicality of it fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 is you dont know how long its going to take for the sba to turn those decisions back so thats why were kind of assuming first quarter to really start that brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah okay perfect and then maybe just one for gary on that on the retail ire gary i guess the added reserve this quarter just what are the what are the figures confirmed in that portfolio today i guess as you kind of take your deep dive can you talk a lot about the hotel and the restaurant but just that retail ire what should we be thinking about there or where you guys are focused on gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah its that book we built about million of reserves in it and it really brian only moved that reserve position up slightly its a fairly sizable book and it was just a few credits that had some retail related exposure where the tenants were more impacted its a portfolio that we feel very good about were not seeing any concerns in it whatsoever the deferral rate is just a touch above on it at this point so its just a few oneoff tenants really is what it is and when you look at the ltvs there again theyre running right at so its a very wellpositioned book we feel very good about it at this point brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay and just gary just bigger picture i mean i guess the reserve build this quarter wasnt too much i guess do you feel like its largely done at this point based on how it seems like things in credit are doing pretty well i guess is that kind of a big picture read as you sit there today gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania well when you look at the seasonal reserve around the economy starting to show some signs of improvement i mean we wouldnt expect any additional deal from a seasonal economic forecast standpoint as you move forward i mean actually you may see some improvement there if the economy continues to improve and an opportunity though to have some benefit there i mean i think its a little too early to start releasing reserves here as we sit today but based on the reviews that we did we took a heavy look and an aggressive view of the covid impacted environment subject to it getting worse i mean we feel pretty good about where we are and as you look into the next quarter hopefully we can continue to move that downward a little bit brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah okay all right i appreciate thanks guys gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania all right brian thanks vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 okay i have just one clarification there was a question earlier on indirect portfolio as far as the yield which i know is for modeling purposes one thing i forgot to mention is that the life on that portfolio we sold is about months so its very short so just to make sure for those of you that are modeling that you kind of have that data point operator okay thank you and as it was the last question i would like to return the floor to management for any closing comments vincent j delie jr chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you i appreciate the call all the questions on the call i think that there were a lot of very good questions and hopefully weve provided you with significant disclosure relative to your questions and id like to thank the team particularly all of the employees that have stepped up during this time period i mean its been remarkable gary and tom and the credit team has done a fantastic job guiding us through what was a very scary and difficult environment at least early on so i think were coming through this and were feeling better about where we are and were very hopeful that as we move into the next quarter and into the next year we have more clarity from a credit perspective and were in a better position to focus on revenue growth again so thank you everybody appreciate the
