chief financial officer and gary guerrieri our chief credit officer first i will provide a short review of the second quarter financial results then ill cover recent performance trends of our key business model before turning the call over to gary and vince for their remarks lastly ill wrap up the call by discussing the key considerations of last weeks merger announcement with howard bancorp inc fnbs second quarter earnings per share totaled representing an increase on a linked quarter basis operating net income reached a record million and total revenue increased to million our performance resulted in a return on tangible common equity of and growth in tangible book value per share to an increase of or the quarters efficiency ratio of improved due to the benefit of increased revenue and continued expense discipline as we achieved the operating cost saving flow of million our company remains well capitalized with an estimated cet1 ratio of for the second quarter second quarter revenue was supported by record wealth management revenues and strong contributions across a number of segments including insurance mortgage banking capital markets and sba lending many of these areas have continued to benefit from our expansion into higher growth markets on a yeartodate basis wealth management revenues increased over million as total wealth management and insurance revenues increased and respectively looking at the balance sheet on an annualized linked quarter basis fnb demonstrated strong fundamental performance as we saw a hiccup in lending activity that translated into significant spot loan growth of when excluding the impact of ppp loans on a spot basis total deposits were flat with seasonal outflows and a decline in time deposit balance noninterestbearing deposits grew to billion at june and now comprise a third of total deposits this brings our loantodeposit ratio to providing fnb with ample liquidity and a favorable funding mix moving forward diving deeper into the wholesale banks performance this quarter we are encouraged that the commercial loan activity has begun to pick up across the footprint and pipelines are healthy entering the second half of the year we have significant opportunities within the commercial pipelines in the carolinas pittsburgh and midatlantic markets which reached the highest level in the last two years additionally strength in the total nearterm pipeline give us optimism for a strong second half for commercial loan origination consistent with our comments on the april call activity levels around commercial platforms as well as consumers are encouraging given our goal to reach midsingledigit loan growth on a spot basis by the end of the year however ill note that commercial line utilization rates remain well below historical levels we are optimistic that utilization rates could move higher in the second half of this year as remaining ppp loans are processed through fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 the forgiveness period and the us economy begins to accelerate as the supply chain for many industries improves as we discussed on the prior call our mortgage banking business continues to see nearrecord production volumes however gainonsale margins contracted across the industry during the quarter reflecting the current market condition in addition to mortgage banking the overall consumer pipelines have grown significantly since the beginning of the year weve begun to experience lending growth across the consumer product set as economic activity has begun to pick up we were experiencing increased loan demand in commercial and consumer banking and favorable credit trends with that ill turn the call over to gary so he can provide additional detail on asset quality gary gary l guerrieri chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you vincent good morning everyone our results for the second quarter were favorable and we are very pleased with our credit portfolios position moving into the second half of the year delinquency and nonperforming levels decreased meaningfully during the quarter and our net losses remained below positive momentum of the broader economy and continued reopening of businesses have further contributed to the favorable results for the quarter particularly as some borrowers in the more sensitive industries and asset classes begin to show signs of recovery ill cover that in greater detail later in my remarks but first lets walk through our credit results for the second quarter and review some of those highlights the level of delinquency excluding ppp balances ended june at bps a basis point improvement linked quarter which was driven by broad improvements across all portfolios notably commercial and onetofour family the level of npls and oreo also improved to end the quarter at basis points representing a basis point decrease from the prior quarters exppp level our npls decreased meaningfully down nearly million during the quarter which was driven primarily by a million reduction in the commercial portfolio including the resolution of a credit that was previously reserved for net chargeoffs for the quarter were very low at million or basis points annualized while yeartodate net chargeoffs remained at a very solid bps annualized nongaap net chargeoffs excluding ppp balances were bps and bps for the quarter and year respectively we recognized a million net benefit in provision this quarter following broadly improving economic activity and positive credit quality results through june resulting in a stable reserve position at while the exppp reserve stands at npl coverage also remains very favorable at due to reduced npl levels during the quarter our total ending reserve position inclusive of acquired unamortized discounts totals id now like to provide some additional color on our loan portfolio and give an overview of our approach to underwriting and managing risk as lending markets remain highly competitive touching quickly on loan deferrals we ended june at a level of of our core loan portfolio with these levels continuing to decline as new requests have essentially ceased and borrowers returned to contractual payment schedules fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 our banking teams have also remained actively engaged with our commercial customers to stay apprised of how the broader economy and emerging trends are affecting their operations including the impact of supply chain disruptions labor shortages and the general future outlook for their respective industries these factors are all taken into careful consideration during our underwriting and credit approval processes which is consistent with our overall credit philosophy we were successful in closing a number of highquality lending opportunities in the quarter with strong borrowers that fit within our desired credit profile and we will continue to approach transactions in this manner to help us meet our growth targets while maintaining our desired risk profile in closing we had a successful quarter marked by solid credit results and loan losses which has us favorably positioned moving into the second half of the year weve made significant progress working down rated credits as indicated by a reduction in classifieds reflecting the tireless efforts put forth by our workout teams to reduce exposure to more sensitive industries and take risk off the table as economic conditions continue to improve as we look ahead to new lending opportunities our core credit principles that have served us well throughout economic cycles remain front and center in all credit decisions we make including consistent and disciplined underwriting across the footprint attentive and timely management of risk and proactive portfolio management to further position us for the quarters ahead ill now turn the call over to vince calabrese our chief financial officer for his remarks vincent j calabrese chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks gary and good morning today i will discuss our financial results and current expectations as noted on slide first sic second quarter eps increased to up significantly from the prior and yearago quarters looking at highlights for the quarter on an operating basis net income available to common stockholders increased million or to a record million as total revenue increased million or operating expenses were wellcontrolled down million linked quarter we saw a negative provision for credit losses due to the improved credit metrics that gary just discussed the linked quarter growth in operating ppnr of million or reflects the companys strong performance in the quarter even without provision benefit now turning to slide to review the balance sheet periodend loan balances excluding ppp increased million or annualized on a linked quarter basis through organic growth with strong contributions from both the commercial and consumer segments as the economy continues to rebound on an average balance basis total loans decreased million reflecting accelerated ppp forgiveness during the second quarter on the deposit side average deposits increased billion or to over billion a record high with non interest bearing deposits comprising of total deposits on a spot basis deposits were relatively flat given the managed defined and highercost time deposits fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 focusing on slide net interest income increased million to million as the ppp contribution increased million to million which was offset by a million decreased contribution from purchase accounting accretion to million the underlying net interest income trends improved due to a more favorable balance sheet mix and our continued focus on reducing deposit costs in the lower interest rate environment was evidenced by our total cost of interestbearing deposits declining basis points to basis points reported net interest margin decreased basis points to as earning asset yields declined basis points which is partially offset by the basis point reduction in the cost of funds the yield on total loans and leases remained stable at but excluding the higher cash balances purchase accounting accretion and ppp impacts the underlying net interest margin would be representing a basis point increase compared to the first quarter and the second quarter in a row of improving underlying net interest margin lets now look at noninterest income and expense on slide and slide noninterest income totaled million decreasing million from record levels last quarter we achieved record wealth management revenue of million through contributions across the geographic footprint and positive market impact on assets under management sba volume and average size of transactions increased during the quarter driving sba premium revenues to million almost double the prior quarter pipelines in this business remain solid wed expect nearterm sba premium revenues to be strong mortgage banking operations income decreased million as gainonsale margins tightened meaningfully in the second quarter throughout the industry heldforsale pipeline declined from significantly elevated levels and the benefit from mortgage servicing rights impairment valuation recovery was million lower than last quarter noninterest expense decreased million linked quarter on a reported basis but excluding million of branch consolidation costs in the quarter noninterest expense decreased million or on an operating basis salaries and employee benefits decreased million or primarily related to the timing of normal annual longterm stock awards recognized in the first quarter each year outside services expenses increased million reflecting increases from thirdparty technology providers legal costs and other consulting engagements we are very pleased with this quarters results with record operating net income accelerating sequential loan growth strong revenue growth solid credit quality metrics and continued growth in tangible book value per share increasing per share to now turning to our outlook for the third quarter excluding ppp contribution we would expect net interest income to be up slightly in the third quarter compared to the second quarter the level of ppp contribution will be a direct function of the amount of forgiveness processed during the quarter our current thinking is that we will see around million of forgiveness in the third quarter which would translate into a million reduction in net interest income contribution from ppp loans however if the sba approves forgiveness closer to second quarter levels the reduction in ppp contribution would be smaller we expect noninterest income to be in the high million area given the diversified nature of our noninterest income revenue streams we expect noninterest expense to be flattish compared to operating expenses in the fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 second quarter our provision for loan losses remains dependent on the level of loan origination activity and we are encouraged by the favorable credit trends observed during the first half of regarding our full year assumptions our loan growth total revenue and noninterest expense assumptions remain unchanged with current deposit growth reflecting the benefit of additional government stimulus as we continue to see increased liquidity and a loantodeposit ratio below historical levels with that ill turn the call back to vince vincent j delie jr chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks vince id like to provide an update on the pending howard acquisition we were excited to begin the integration process with the howard team and we are confident that our established leadership in the midatlantic market will work well with the talented bankers at howard we share a deep culture of client and community service which should allow for a seamless transition in the coming months for all of our stakeholders we also expect the conversion and integration to run smoothly as both organizations operate on a common core system as discussed previously our decision to selectively enter highergrowth markets through a combination of de novo location loan production offices and strategic acquisitions has fnb well positioned today with the howard merger we will grow to the number six deposit share in the baltimore msa while adding meaningful customer density to the midatlantic region which covers maryland washington dc and northern virginia our longterm strategy is to best position our company in the markets where we have the ability to grow loans lowcost deposits and fee income organically through increasing our market share over the long term and expanding the universe of clients and prospects if you look at our market expansion strategy in the midatlantic our four acquisitions since came at a lower relative acquisition cost with the weighted average price to tangible book of times our growth strategy in the midatlantic region provided access to a population of million and more than businesses with revenue greater than since the end of our compounded annual organic loan growth for fnb in maryland was furthermore as a company overall we have nearly doubled our annual noninterest income since from million to million most of which has to do with our investment in products and services but also bringing those capabilities into our expansion markets and broadening our client relationships therefore we are very excited about our longterm potential for growth as we offer our deep product suite to howards customer base looking specifically at some of the transaction highlights the howard franchise increases fnbs baltimore deposits by billion to billion on a pro forma basis while creating a combined organization of more than billion in total assets additionally the transaction carries lower execution risk given the end market synergies we view the transaction as financially attractive with a eps accretion with fully phasedin cost savings and enhanced pro forma profitability metrics which include a basis point improvement in the efficiency ratio and an internal rate of return greater than consistent with our approach to capital management the transaction is expected to be neutral to cet1 at close and includes minimal tangible book value dilution of as i noted earlier our tbv growth this quarter alone was essentially earning the tbv dilution back in one quarter fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 our ma strategy hasnt changed from what weve said the last couple of quarters first and foremost our focus is on organic growth but if opportunities arise where the targeted end market has potential for significant cost saves and carries low execution risk with minimal tangible book value dilution the potential acquisition becomes worthy of evaluation we are excited about the opportunities in front of us as our organization continues to flourish and evolve as a more diversified financial institution last month we are honored to be named as a top workplace in northeast ohio for the seventh consecutive year and our 30th workplace recognition overall which are based solely on employee feedback in closing we are focused on continuing our commitment to advance our market position by gaining scale and operational efficiency and by cultivating a great culture and meaningful lasting relationships with our clients and communities while simultaneously creating value for our shareholders with that i will turn the call over to the operator for questions operator question and answer section operator yes thank you at this time we will begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions and this mornings first question comes from frank schiraldi with piper sandler frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co good morning vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co just on loan growth just want to make sure i understand the midsingledigit growth expectations or guide for does that assume vince that loan utilization rates remain at the low levels they are now and then there could be upside if that moves higher is that the messaging vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yes frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay and then secondly on the other side of the coin i think i worry about a little bit as i know you guys have always had such a strong credit function theres so much liquidity out there presumably chasing loans that i would imagine companies banks could get more aggressive on pricing terms and pricing and terms and good fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 banks could find themselves on the sidelines to some degree so just wondered if youre seeing evidence of that in the marketplace in terms of tighter pricing tighter terms and just your general thoughts there vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania frank ill try to tackle the initial response and then ill turn it over to gary because he sees elaborately the trends relative to credit and pricing more than i do but i can tell you we have regions if you look at the breakdown of the growth by regions pittsburgh has a huge portfolio they were up about our capital region which is harrisburg scranton lancaster reading they were up just almost south carolina which is charleston principally they were up raleigh was up approximately that was pretty decentsized portfolio and then we saw some growth in builder finance and in our sba portfolio so i think that we have enough granularity and that was the strategy from day one was to not be dependent on a single geography where adverse selection kicks in and market trends move in the wrong direction we end up booking assets that come back to haunt us as you know from your long history with this company we are very conservative many of the moves that we made leading into the current situation we were very proactive and discarding what we considered to be risky asset classes because we thought we were in the late turn of the cycle even before the pandemic so i think were very well positioned from a credit perspective i think were proven we dont have to make any bones about it we performed exceptionally well in fact i would argue that without stimulus many of our peers might have had more substantial credit problems because of concentration in certain industries which we dont have so i think that given everything that weve designed within our company its all working pretty well and i would suspect that those pipelines its going to vary from market to market some markets are irrational and were going to back away but we can lean in in other areas to pick up the slack go ahead gary ill let you talk about the trends what youre seeing there gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah frank in terms of the competitive nature of it it surely is that were going to pick our spots with our clients and well compete from a pricing standpoint as we have weve seen during the quarter some great highquality opportunities with some really strong clients as i mentioned in my remarks were seeing more and more of those opportunities theres some ma activity going on and well continue to play in that space and pick our spots the other thing we are seeing is its a very good time to get rid of some assets that we dont want on the balance sheet for the long term banks are very aggressive in that space right now and its one of the reasons why we were able to upgrade some credits and more importantly get rid of some of those credits that we didnt want during the quarter which helped that classified number come down significantly we do also expect that to continue as we roll into  so hopefully we get some additional benefit there but well be opportunistic to pick our spots take care of our clients as we do each and every day frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 okay great and then one last one if i could just in terms of ma certainly howard does fit the bill of what youve been talking about for the last few quarters vince in terms of the potential strategy or what you look for if in a partner just wondering i guess maybe you never say never but just wondering your thoughts on could you see something more expansionary larger on the ma side or is that kind of largely off the table for you guys just given what youre able to do on the organic side vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania i think were still focusing on organic growth opportunistically there may be opportunities that come up but were going to be keenly focused on tangible book value dilution as a governor so thats kind of rules out certain transactions right unless we could get substantial cost takeout and it fits strategically and is active to our organic growth strategy i would rule it out if it works within our strategy and i said it pretty clearly i thought in the prepared comments were going to look for those metrics that drive returns for the shareholders and fits into our strategy which i think weve executed extraordinarily well i reflect back to i dont think there has been a quarter where weve missed what our forecasting has been so i think our employees have done an exceptional job integrating those companies weve done a phenomenal job rolling noninterest income i mentioned that on the call its more than doubled almost all organic and again its the execution of our strategy against the market expansion and the accumulation of companies that weve brought on through our acquisitions and through organic growth so that continues to bode well for us and i think weve got a lot of work to do on the digital front we continue to improve our interface and we continue to drive activity from a technology perspective and thats very exciting so i think when you look at all of that thats pretty much our ma strategy i think ive reinforced it in the script and hopefully thats clear enough for everybody frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co yes thats great thank you thanks for all the color thats all i have vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you yeah gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania appreciate it thanks frank operator thank you and the next question comes from michael perito with kbw michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 good morning michael vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning michael michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc couple of questions from me just on the unchanged revenue guide i think approximately billion for the full year it seems like you guys are tracking a little ahead of that to start to the first six months here and im just curious outside of whats likely some conservatism around ppp forgiveness i imagine in terms of the timing of when that recognizes is there anything else in the back half of the year that we should be mindful of from a revenue perspective like for example the recent wealth production has been strong is there some likes for normalization there or anything else that could potentially kind of slow the trajectory youre on from a revenue standpoint in the back half of the year vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania well i think were being conservative because were in uncharted territory here i mean i want to be optimistic im an optimistic person you guys have accused me of that many times i try to stay positive but i also know that theres quite a few unknowns out there the changes that have gone on with the pandemic it really turns some things upside down so i think can we achieve greater loan growth than increased in outstanding balances in the loan portfolio absolutely but the supply chain needs to be correct as there are a number of issues particularly in the ci segment with companies that cant meet full production quotas because they cant get supplies therere commodity price increases that havent been reflected and revolver balances because they cant get the product or theyre unwilling to take the risk on price volatility in the current market so theres quite a few unknowns out there inflation what will inflation do when you look at the mortgage business gainonsale margins came in fairly substantially we signaled that on the last call somebody had asked and we had indicated that we saw that they were coming in and theyve been varying so there is some volatility in the pricing there too because of the changes in the 10year interest rate in particular so theres quite a bit out there that makes it difficult to forecast having said all of that i think the activity has picked up the pipelines are up substantially its the best pipeline weve had in consumer small business and middle market banking in a number of years and im hopeful that we can execute and turn that around when you look at noninterest income i think one of the benefits of having such a diverse base of feebased businesses is when one is up when one is down the other one is up so sba is really up fairly significantly wealth had a big leap because of some organic growth that we experienced and improvement in that asset values because of market condition that all offsets the mortgage declines fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 so i think we and i can tell you from a capital markets perspective we probably would have been a little more conservative looking into the future but i think with the 10year at about right now theres now an opportunity for people to continue to fix the rate to derivatives fee income looks like its still hanging in there pretty solidly weve got some great syndications opportunities in our debt capital markets platform that we launched weve already seen three or four deals that weve participated in so thats all exciting but again its very difficult to forecast in this environment michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah no that makes sense appreciate the color maybe a question on the kind of the liquidity position and the margin from here i mean you guys continue to grow deposits which i imagine is a good indicator of kind of overall customer growth in this quarter particularly but with a lot of the stimulus playing out over the last two quarters but just curious how you guys are thinking about the cash position pace of deployment in the bond book andor conversely sitting heavier in cash and hoping that the loan growth kind of materializes and maybe theres some normalization in deposits if the economy continues to recover just any thoughts there vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would say that on the investment portfolio side i mean our plan from here is basically to reinvest the cash flows coming off the portfolio were not looking to increase the size of it i mean during the second quarter we opportunistically reinvested of the cash flow so we grew the portfolio a little bit there were some opportunities in april and late june our plan from here for the rest of the year would just be to reinvest about million to million a month kind of if thats working the reinvestment rates in the second quarter they were rates went down today they were down to and could even go sub1 so well pause when it doesnt make sense to do that so the investment strategy is pretty much intact and then the level of cash on the balance sheet that we have the main focus there is going to be to deploy that in loan origination fund the loan growth in the second half of the year and as vince said theres a lot of opportunities there throughout the markets and then there is opportunity to use some of the cash to once we closed the transaction theres some borrowings in some deposit classes that will make sense to kind of use some of our cash there too so thats kind of the high level plan as far as the cash position michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it helpful and then just one last question from me just regarding howard appreciate the additional color looking at howards recent results it seemed like over the last quarter or two particularly they had started to really show some good organic growth despite everything going on and after some initial slowdown after their transaction they had with 1st mariner i was just curious i mean i imagine thats just kind of a critical piece of this for you guys as you mentioned kind of be additive to your baltimore growth im just curious if you have any color you can provide on kind of the retention of that lending team and how you kind of expect them to fit into your already growing operation in the greater baltimore region vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thats a great question and im happy to answer it i think when we first set out to do due diligence on howard we didnt know what we would find and as we dug deeper into the information we became extremely confident with the quality of the people and the quality of the portfolio and i think this is one of the lowest credit marks weve fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 had and believe me gary and his team do a fairly extensive job tom fisher gary the whole team evaluating risk within those targets were very seasoned in doing acquisitions and many of us have been here for a number of years ive personally been here for i think years or years indiscernible remember but theres a quite a bit of due diligence that goes on we were very impressed with the people with the culture with mary anns leadership i know the company has struggled a little bit but when you look at the opportunity for us just in the dda accounts we had customers in the baltimore market with our data analytics teams with our digital strategy on the consumer side that provides substantial benefit if you look at the opportunities from a mortgage lending perspective in the market its been a big contributor for our success the midatlantic region in total they are in mortgage banking that provides us with a tremendous amount of opportunity in the consumer segment relative to mortgage banking if you look at commercial banking their legal lending limit was relatively small while they have a really we think a pretty solid customer base they dont offer derivatives they dont offer international banking they dont offer as many treasury management services as we offer so theres a substantial opportunity which by the way this has not all been modeled we think over time just like we did with the rest of the company with noninterest income growth we have an opportunity with that portfolio and gary i dont know if you want to talk about the credit due diligence gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania sure vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania and how we evaluated the opportunity gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah the due diligence work that the team does and as vince mentioned its a deep team the group has done many of these transactions we totally reunderwrote of the commercial loan book at howard and it checked out very very nicely vince mentioned the credit mark at we also reviewed of the retail book with the underwriting there evidence of lowerrisk underwriting so felt very comfortable really across the books the philosophy around the commercial underwriting was very similar to ours so again a lot of good work done there felt very comfortable with the credit mark and the work that the team has done at howard so we feel its a very good match from a cultural standpoint vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania and we also from a leadership perspective we have strong leadership in baltimore baltimore has been a doubledigit performer for us from an organic perspective weve grown per year since there so we have a very strong team they have very good people id say our focus is probably a little bit further up market their focus is middle market and small business it fits in very well for us so theres plenty of opportunities for their bankers to join our team and benefit fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 plus we are keeping the credit officer so he will be one of the senior credit officers in the marketplace because of garys confidence the management team will be there tomorrow so we will have a meeting with the bankers tomorrow and were very excited about that and i think that well be able to convey some of the things weve said today to those individuals and i think theyll be excited about the opportunities for them to crosssell additional products and services and to serve their clients i dont remember if youve asked me anything else but i will tell you that were very excited about the opportunity to double our deposit share in baltimore there are a number of large players there at number six deposit share with billion i think we nearly doubled number and then moves up fairly dramatically from there so having that additional scale in baltimore and the midatlantic region is critically important so look what it did for us in pittsburgh it substantially accelerated our ability to go after middle market opportunities and grow organically in pittsburgh and i think the same will happen there michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it helpful yeah the only other element was just kind of the actual formal retention of lenders but it sounds like thats still being sorted out vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania we are still working through that believe me weve allocated substantial retention pull we have a process that we use to evaluate talent and flight risk weve done this a number of times michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc right vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania i would say despite what everybody believes weve done a pretty good job of retaining who we wanted to retain throughout our history of acquisition so i cant say any more than that i think indiscernible michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah no thats perfect very helpful everyone thank you for the time and taking my questions vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks mike fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks mike vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yep take care operator thank you and the next question comes from jared shaw with wells fargo timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning this is timur braziler vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning jared sic timur timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc filling in for jared how are you guys doing gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania good vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania good timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc maybe the first question on mortgage production and then looking at whether or not youre putting those mortgages on the portfolio versus selling them given the current trends should the expectation be that more of the mortgages end up on balance sheet and i guess what would that do for mortgage banking outlook going forward and what would need to happen to really get mortgage banking revenues higher vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would say i guess a few things so just a comment on the activity in the quarter as we mentioned in our remarks i mean we had a significant decline in the gainonsale margins of over basis points during the quarter mortgage rates declined basis points in the second quarter after a steep run up in the first so thats a big driver to the change from the first to the second quarter and then the amount of the saleable pipeline dropped about so thats helpful feedback and then our msr valuation reserve recovery we had million in the fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 first quarter of positive recovery then we had million in the second quarter so those are kind of the three kind of key variables there from a sole production standpoint we actually sold more quarter over quarter second quarter versus first quarter and were really selling the to folks the loans that all loans that are saleable the jumbo loans we tend to keep on balance sheet indiscernible programs that are more geared towards that so the kind of hold versus sell is really by the nature of the loan the overall production was billion in the second quarter just up from million and the full production was comparable so i mean as we go forward from here i mean as we sit here today purchase activity is about of the retail volume in the first quarter so another kind of key indicator things seem to have stabilized somewhat as far as gainonsale margins and through the third quarter were looking at around the same level but theres some upside there depending on what happens with rates which we all know is impossible to predict but the margins having stabilized is definitely a positive as we go forward and we make that decision like i said its based on the nature of the loan whether its going in portfolio or selling it timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thats helpful thank you maybe just switching over it seems like charleston had another good quarter here in the second quarter and i know last quarter there was a good amount of detail provided on your expansionary efforts there how does that market compare from an organic growth standpoint to what had been going on in baltimore are you confident that you can gain that market organically are there opportunities to supplement that growth through smaller ma or just as the smaller size of that market relative to the baltimore and kind of dc msa make it easier to attract talent and grow there organically vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i think again a great question when we look at charleston the opportunity in charleston was its about a half little less than half the size of baltimore pittsburgh in terms of msa so we tried to size it we did an analysis to see what it would take to de novo into that market adequately cover the marketplace and were doing that with a combination of branch expansion and atm and itm deployment within the marketplace some of it cobranded atm deployment so i think we came to the conclusion that we could expand into the charleston market and grow it if we had the right people and we were positioned properly within the marketplace from a customer access perspective and then leverage our digital tools and our analytical tools to drive additional growth and that seems to be working very well i mean when you look at the retail locations that we rolled out two of the locations have been open for over a year in the top of our branches from a production perspective if you look at the ci team the team that we recruited very solid individuals who i actually enjoy interacting with the great bankers with len hutchinson and his team in charleston have done a phenomenal job they brought over a number of key clients and then the ppp process really helped accelerate that too because it gave us an opportunity to bring on thousands of customers in the southeast because some of the larger banks couldnt get the ppp loans processed so all of that together has worked exceptionally well for us so i think charleston is a de novo opportunity and there are others that weve pursued greenville south carolina asheville and weve done similar strategies and theyre starting to take off too so i think theres room for both we have to evaluate how we want to deploy our fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 resources and do it in a way that provides the highest returns for the shareholders and that in charlestons particular instance i think it makes more sense for us to go in de novo timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay i understand and then just one last one if i can for gary the allowance ratio still seems relatively elevated and the pace of reserve release is a little bit slower than what weve seen at others i guess how much did qualitative factors contribute to the slowing pace of reserve release in the second quarter and whats the outlook for future reserve releases again its are you all actively trying to moderate that versus what the model may be spitting out and at what level do you think you can get back to closer to a dayone type allowance gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania when you look at where we sit today i mean there still exists risk in the economy we talked about the supply chain issues inflation and other items around that you also have some pandemic starting to pop up again so were going to continue to be a bit cautious with that when you go back to cecl dayone we started at from an acl standpoint today we see that ex ppp so i would tell you that there surely is some room to continue to move that downwards over time as we work through the economy and the pandemic and get back to some normalization so all told qualitatively were at the higher end of our scale right now that generally ranges from to were at the higher end as we sit here today so there is some room there and when i look at the economy normalizing over time i think were in a good spot as we sit here today with some future benefit to come timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you for the questions operator thank you and the next question comes from dave bishop with seaport research partners david j bishop q analyst seaport global securities llc yeah good morning gentlemen vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey there vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 david j bishop q analyst seaport global securities llc hey maybe we can stay on that topic gary i dont know if you can quantify this but assuming normalization in the loan growth outlook there once we get through some of the ppp churn or so would you think youd be back to reserving on a quarterly basis at that of loans just curious if theres any color you can get in terms of how youre thinking about reserving on a more normalized basis gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania well there is a lot that comes into play these days mix is an important part of it when you look at the lifeofloan situation under cecl but once things normalize and portfolio activity normalizes yeah i would feel comfortable that the economy is going to be back in a spot where you are moving very close to or at normalization from a provisioning standpoint so as i just mentioned i think there is still some uncertainty out there were going to manage it appropriately and well work it through the system as the economy continues to improve stabilize and the growth starts to normalize so itll be a quarterbyquarter analysis as we look at it each and every quarter vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania the only thing i would add too is that the growth we had spot growth million weve provided for that so that was probably million or so so with that negative million benefit really was kind of million except for that loan growth so we always talk about we need to provide for the loan growth so that was a good problem to have in the quarter but the underlying kind of release a little bit bigger from a kind of pure provision standpoint gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah and a lot of that was driven it was really driven by the improvement in the credit portfolio that we talked about with reductions in classifieds and all of the credit metrics all moving in a very positive direction that really drove that reduction david j bishop q analyst seaport global securities llc got it and then in terms of the loan yields look like they remain relatively stable here just curious if you can provide some commentary in terms of the onboarding of new loans originations that the yields this quarter what youre seeing and is there a significant difference across your various markets and regions vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania i think its amazingly similar at this point i think its pretty competitive across the board so the feedback weve gotten from the field visitors theres some pressure on credit spreads the price over cost of funds i think that given the environment we are in where everybody is flushed with liquidity obviously thats a everyone is trying to grow their loan book this is very competitive i think on a quarteroverquarter basis the yields have been pretty similar i dont think this is a new phenomenon i dont know if gary you want to add to that i mean i think its been sustained for several quarters gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 no i would agree with that when you look quarteroverquarter its pretty much fairly stable and sitting where its been here its the occasional transaction that gets really pressured and as i mentioned earlier well pick our spots with our clients and be effective there vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania the higherquality credit obviously is getting priced very similarly in the market i think as long as you can justify the returns on capital invested crosssell opportunities ancillary products and services capital markets opportunities it can work but the credit spreads are definitely in david j bishop q analyst seaport global securities llc got it appreciate the color gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania sure thanks operator thank you and the next question comes from manuel navas with da davidson company vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania hello operator well mr navas your line is lost were moving on the next question comes from samuel varga with stephens inc samuel varga q analyst stephens inc good morning ph im on for breese vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania hi there gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning samuel varga q analyst stephens inc i wanted to ask a little bit about the direct installments and the other loan categories and just wanted to get a perspective on i guess what drove the increases there was that due to homes and home equity and if so particularly on the other loan side i just wanted to get a feel for whether thats due to larger volumes or just the size of the loans due to the increased car prices fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah it was really driven by the home equity book the home equity book weve been very active in that our home equity installment product has been a very good product for us that we have seen good solid growth and good solid activity in the automobile book growing slightly theres issues in the supply chain there as well with new inventory so in terms of that book its growing at a much smaller pace but its really being driven in that home equity installment product at this point vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania and i think as you at the beginning of the pandemic people were afraid to do anything all of a sudden trillions of dollars of stimulus flowed into the economy people began individuals consumers began to regain confidence they either bought a new house and paid more than they would have before the pandemic or they decided hey im going to renovate my home now and thats what were starting to see were seeing an escalation in our direct installment portfolio in particular and the pipelines have grown principally because of where we are in the cycle relative to the pandemic and i think the overall effect of stimulus has led to people taking a little more risk in terms of improving their property and then theyre seeing property value appreciation which gives that added confidence right to get that done so i think all of that is kind of flowing in here im not sure that were the most aggressive lender from an ltv perspective i dont think we are i think its more a function of the economy and demand for that product moving up in terms of whats happening gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania in terms of the growth that you are seeing in the auto space thats kind of seasonally driven the dealers are having trouble with new vehicles from that standpoint thats a smaller part of our business but its impacting activity there samuel varga q analyst stephens inc understood thanks for the color there and then just returning to the mortgage side just for a quick question there was about a linked quarter growth there and so can we assume that that was due to holding the production on the books vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah thats just the nature of the loans that we originated during the quarter so yeah indiscernible just from origination activity samuel varga q analyst stephens inc great and then one final one for me with regards to the howard acquisition could you give us some details on the accretion that you expect to recognize and the timeframe over which you expect to recognize that fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i can touch on that so when you net the credit mark accretion with a loan mark accretion and some of the smaller items i mean it really only totals to about bps of the accretion so on a kind of more cash accretion basis youre looking at total accretion in terms of over what timeframe we assume a five year life of the loan portfolio and thats pretty much accreted straight line so on a net basis its relatively small and less than like million indiscernible samuel varga q analyst stephens inc understood vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania timing wise vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah yeah samuel varga q analyst stephens inc got it thank you for providing the color i appreciate it thats all for me operator thank you and the next question comes from brian martin with janney montgomery brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey good morning guys vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey brian gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania hi brian vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania hi brian fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey just one on the ppp just the timing of the forgiveness or just the recognition of the remaining million do you guys have any kind of big picture thoughts on how that plays out or how are you seeing that unfolds the next couple of quarters and into next year vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania well the forgiveness that i mentioned what we had built into our estimates is billion the million is just for the full year and this is full contribution yeah most will be this year well have some tail that will go into next year and full year yeah probably about or brian it would carry over into next year but we would expect i mean the pace that the sba was forgiving if they really ramped up in the second quarter we would think with round now starting to get forgiven that would start to accelerate at some point we just dont know exactly when so were a little conservative in our million that were assuming for the third quarter as more opportunity for that number would be higher but the vast majority of whats left with the cover come through this year brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay perfect and then just going to the margin for a minute can you just give any thoughts on the margin accretion that comes from howard and then just on the core margin this quarter it sounded still obviously this is the second quarter of kind of incremental increase just how youre thinking about that core margin going forward i guess it sounds like its at a bottom its just continuing to trend higher based on some of the commentary on loan growth and maybe utilization getting better but just kind of the howard add and then just the core margin if you can give any color vince vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah let me ill touch on the core margin and maybe ph ask vince to comment on howard impact when im finished with that but just a couple of comments here so right net interest income went up million now while the ppp contribution was up million indiscernible was down million so they kind of got a push there so the growth that we saw was driven by the spot loan growth the million that we talked about as well as continued reductions in the cost of interestearning deposits so as we go ahead from here i mean on the interestbearing deposit costs side we brought it down another ph to for the quarter the spot is basis points at the end of the quarter we have continued benefit from cd maturities that continue to roll down i mean theres million to million a month for the next three months that are on our books at to basis points indiscernible basis points or so so that will continue to provide some benefit theres still some opportunity kind of on the commercial side too and i guess to put the cds in perspective the total cost of that portfolio at june was ph we look for that to come down another basis points or so by the end of the year and thats kind of baked into our guidance as we look ahead to the third quarter excluding ppp which we commented on this some variability there we expect net interest income to be up slightly the stronger the loan growth is the stronger you get there of course and the core nim is going to be flattish from here i mean were trading ppp for kind of the normal loans as i fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 would call them so that will kind of roll through the portfolio but kind of flattish on the margin and up on net interest income given those factors that the loan growth plus the continued opportunity to bring down the cost of deposit vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah and on the impact to the overall margin with the howard combination as you know howards margin is higher than ours in the lowtomid so when you kind of flap them together it is going to be modestly accretive to our margin i wouldnt say a whole lot and part of thats also due to some of the balance sheet items that we plan to execute on that vince alluded to earlier on so its a very modest contribution to a higher margin brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc perfect okay and then just the hover of the baltimore loan portfolio today and i guess how does that stand maybe if you commented on that maybe i missed them sorry vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania when you say how does it stand are you asking about the size of the portfolio brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah its just how is that trending today that the baltimore portfolio gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania its trending upwards the exposure there is ph million in total and balances are right around billion brian brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc billion okay vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania and its been moving up nicely at a rate brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah thats what it sounded like okay and then just the last one or two for me was just on the just vincent you gave a lot of color and i appreciate it on the ma just to kind of understand whats happening there i mean just a dialog on ma today i guess if you can give some color on that and then just the just curious if you lay out what youd be looking at from an ma perspective how large a transaction could you potentially consider if it met the criteria you mentioned earlier just trying to understand where the opportunities are how big an opportunity you may consider if it was appropriate fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i dont think again im going to refer back to the comments that i made brian i think that were going to focus on minimal tangible book value dilution strong irrs and were going to evaluate whats best for the shareholders and when you look at this transaction this is the best way for us to deploy capital at this point in time obviously if we start rolling loans nicely that usually ends up being the highest return on capital invested so thats how we look at it this particular obviously given the activity everybody knows theres quite a bit of ma activity going on so it doesnt take much to stumble across a conversation right we all know that were going to be very disciplined in how we move forward and thats again i think my prepared comments kind of summed it all up brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay perfect and then just last one just on the buyback i guess just curious how youre thinking about that today or just how you see that unfolding in indiscernible vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania acquisition as i mentioned again in my comments the tangible book value dilution on a whole company basis was de minimis right we earned it already its not going to change how we look at deployment of capital moving forward which includes buybacks the dividend the indiscernible so were going to continue to deploy our disciplined capital management strategy that we laid out for you over the last few quarters and thats still going to be part of our decision making process vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania well be opportunistic on share repurchases so its definitely in the vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thats not off the table vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania right brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah okay perfect vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc just wanted to clear that up so thanks guys for taking the questions vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania okay thank you appreciate it good questions gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks brian vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks brian vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you operator thank you and the next question comes from michael young with truist securities michael young q analyst truist securities inc hey thanks for taking the question wanted to ask just a followup on actually net chargeoffs gary theres obviously a lot of pieces that are moving within cecl and loan growth that all affect provision levels but net chargeoffs at or basis points depending on how you look at it are historically low for you all was there anything that was kind of like onetimey in there in terms of recovery and should we expect kind of low levels and then trend higher back to that basis points to basis points kind of over time or just any outlook there would be helpful gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania actually michael it went the other way we had net chargeoffs as you know of million in the quarter and that was really driven by one acquired account that weve been working through over the last few years from the yadkin acquisition that was a million writedown during the quarter so absent that which and that was previously reserved for quite a while back absent that we would have had a net recovery quarter this quarter so the book really across all of the portfolios is performing really nicely right now naturally we talk about the chargeoff levels in that normal range of ours and eventually i would expect that things will normalize over time right now the positions that weve made in moving some higherrisk asset classes off of the books over the last number of years has really benefited us we also are sitting here with an outlook for more upgrades as i mentioned earlier which should provide some benefit going into  so as we sit here today and ive been communicating this regularly the portfolio and the position of us we feel really good about it at the moment fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania and i will tell you ill remind everybody we are occ and fed regulated so we have a very professional strong oversight on our portfolio weve gone through what several reviews since the pandemic started and have been in constant touch with the occ so were feeling pretty good about the credit situation here gary and his team have done a terrific job michael young q analyst truist securities inc okay great thanks for the color my last one is just on ppp forgiveness can you maybe just talk about qualitatively whats going on with customers as that happens are you guys retaining additional deposits or expanding relationships just kind of qualitative factors that we should be thinking of as this continues throughout the year vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i dont have any hard fast facts for you at my fingertips but there were approximately ppp loans in the first two rounds i dont know what the third round tells because we kept that mostly for our customers but probably several hundred more i would say in prospect but the or so were purely prospects they were largely centered around our southeast and midatlantic regions because there were several large banks that couldnt provide ppp loans in a timely fashion or bought people out so we have been capitalizing on converting those clients every ppp borrower that weve had opened a depository account because we have a fully automated process that was part of our authentication process as well so many of those deposit balances have grown which is why our demand deposits in particular have gone up fairly substantially so theres been an element of retention thats going on and the team is very focused on staying in touch with those companies waiting for the opportunity to bid on their credit facilities as they renew thats where we are michael young q analyst truist securities inc okay vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania overall michael young q analyst truist securities inc great thanks vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania great for our clients and for us fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 operator thank you and this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to return the call to vince delie for any closing comments vincent j delie jr chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania id like to thank everybody for calling in and
