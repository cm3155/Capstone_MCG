financial officer for his remarks vincent j calabrese chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks gary good morning everyone now well focus on the fourth quarter financial results and offer guidance for reported fourth quarter net income available to common shareholders totaled million or fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2023 per share after adjusting for million of mergerrelated expenses and million of branch consolidation costs net income reached record levels of million or per share fullyear operating earnings per share also represented one of the companys highest levels coming in at the growth in the balance sheet brought assets to billion with earning assets of nearly billion at the end of the year this was largely driven by the billion linkedquarter increase in spot loans and leases which included organic growth of million or annualized and the million of ub bancorp acquired loans as of the december acquisition date spot ci and commercial real estate each grew linkedquarter consumer loans increased reflecting portfolio growth and adjustable rate mortgages and the continued success of the physicians first mortgage program fullyear total loan growth was a robust billion or on a yearoveryear spot basis roughly half of this growth was related to the previously discussed howard and ub bancorp acquisitions with the remaining half due to strong organic growth capping off three sequential quarters of doubledigit organic growth across the footprint average deposits totaled billion for the fourth quarter increasing million or including ub bancorp acquired deposits over last three weeks of the year when excluding ub bancorp deposits average noninterest bearing deposits declined only linkedquarter to billion and we maintained a favorable deposit mix at yearend with noninterestbearing deposits demonstrating the strength and granularity of fnbs deposit base record quarterly revenue of million was driven by record net interest income totaling million a linkedquarter increase of million or the net interest margin increased basis points to as the earning asset yield increased basis points while the cost of funds increased basis points the largest driver was the increase in yields on loans and leases which increased basis points in fact the december loan origination yield was over the highest since and approximately basis points higher than the spot portfolio rate at quarter end with of the loan portfolio repricing we expect the portfolio rates to continue to increase given the december federal reserve rate hike and the expected 25basispoint increases in february and march the fourth quarter also had record positive operating leverage of which we expect to rank in the upper quartile of our peers on the other side of the balance sheet deposit costs continue to be a significant focus for our team total cumulative deposit betas ended the year at below the forecasted by maintaining the previously mentioned favorable noninterestbearing deposit mix and actively managing interestbearing deposit costs we were able to keep the average interestbearing deposit cost below for the fourth quarter again demonstrating the strength of our customer relationships we have been able to effectively manage deposit costs strategic pricing campaigns supported by our data analytics platform while competitive pressures on deposit pricing continue to rise we are forecasting a cumulative total deposit beta to be in the low at the end of the first quarter of turning to noninterest income and expense noninterest income totaled million a decrease of million or compared to the prior quarter mortgage banking operations income decreased million with a decline in mortgages sold in the secondary market and lower gain on sale margins insurance commissions and fees decreased million reflecting seasonality in the fourth quarter fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2023 capital markets income totaled million with this strong level supported by an increase in syndications and solid contributions from swap fees and international banking on a fullyear basis noninterest income totaled million a decrease from primarily reflecting the significantly lower mortgage banking operations income which was partially offset by several other feebased businesses again demonstrating the importance of our diversified business strategy on an operating basis noninterest expense totaled million a increase from the third quarter and an increase of from the yearago quarter which is primarily driven by the acquired howard and union expense basis in occupancy and equipment and outside services other noninterest expense increased linkedquarter primarily from charitable contributions during the quarter that qualified for pennsylvania bank shares tax credits salaries and employee benefits decreased in the third quarter due to lower medical costs and seasonally lower production of performancerelated incentives excluding significant items totaling million in and million in full year operating noninterest expense increased million or fourth quarters operating preprovision net revenue totaled a record million representing an increase from the yearago quarter on a full year basis operating preprovision net revenue was million an increase of in our capital ratios ended the year at levels that are expected to be at or above pure median tangible book value per common share was at december an increase of per share from september largely from the higher level of earnings and the decreased impact of aoci by per share cet1 ended the year at a solid and the tce ratio totaled lets now look at the financial objectives starting with the balance sheet we expect loans to increase mid single digits on a yearoveryear spot basis total deposits are projected to end at a similar level as the december spot balances as customer growth continues alongside active management of deposit rates in an environment with rising deposit betas full year net interest income is expected to be between billion and billion with the first quarter of between million and million our guidance currently assumes basis point rate increases in both february and march with no additional rate actions projected for the remainder of the year full year noninterest income is expected to be between million to million with the first quarter in the mid million range fullyear guidance for noninterest expense on an operating basis is million and million which assumes an additional million in fdic deposit insurance costs reflecting higher assessment rates that may remain in effect to the deposit insurance fund reserve ratio which the fdics long term goal of this expense guidance range implies growth of to on fullyear operating expense figures at the midpoint of our guidance the efficiency ratio would be below for full year when excluding the fdic increase and the union acquired expense base the expense range would be to on a yearoveryear basis the first quarter noninterest expense is expected to be between million to million as the compensation expense is higher in the first quarter largely due to normal seasonal longterm stock compensation and higher fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2023 payroll taxes at the start of a new year fullyear provision guidance is million to million and is dependent on net loan growth and cecl modelrelated builds from a softer macroeconomic environment lastly the effective tax rate should be between and for the full year which does not assume any investment tax credit activity that may occur with that i will turn the call back to vince vincent j delie jr chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks vince as we start the new year we remain focused on executing our strategy and serving our stakeholders we will do this by staying true to our valuesbased culture and delivering on the financial guidance vince provided with a focus on generating positive operating leverage and efficiently deploying capital in the most effective way to optimize riskadjusted returns for our shareholders before we close today i want to recognize our dedicated team who made our performance possible every employee contributes to the success of the company and i strongly believe that we will continue to win in fnb because of our outstanding employees and the excellent culture we have developed together with that ill turn the call over to the operator for questions operator question and answer section operator ladies and gentlemen at this time well begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions and our first question today comes from frank schiraldi from piper sandler please go ahead with your question frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co good morning just curious indiscernible you guys talked in the release a little bit about where you saw the strongest growth geographically and just curious if you can give a little more color there specifically on the what percentage of the commercial growth youre seeing coming out of the carolina footprint vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania i dont know that we have the specifics in our fingertips but i can tell you just from what indiscernible we get the carolinas had an exceptional year they contributed throughout the year in raleigh charlotte the piedmont triad all of those areas were big contributors to loan growth they all exceeded their planned objectives for the year and had a tremendous year in crossselling so in addition to originating loans they are also able to crosssell capital markets products trust and investment products and insurance throughout that footprint fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2023 so they were a significant driver pittsburgh has always been a solid market for us given our market share here the groups in pittsburgh ph will be key for us this year and i also want to include our expansion market in charleston the team down there has done an exceptional job over the last two years indiscernible the last two years so those areas have been huge contributors in the past the midatlantic region had been a fairly substantial contributor but we were able to through various takeouts reduce the size of the cre portfolio in that market so they had a little bit more of a headwind coming into the year and i will tell you that as we move into next year the pipelines have softened a little bit kind of globally but we had two consecutive quarters of pretty solid growth so were down about yearoveryear ph through the pipeline which is typically a seasonal low point and were being a little more careful as we move into next year theres quite a bit of economic uncertainty and well play it on the conservative side so very excited about where we sit there frank in terms of originations because it was fairly geographically spread out we got some assistance from the midwest and the northeast with and some of the slower growth markets because they have a heavier industrial base and there seemed to be a little more activity there to offset some of the declines in indiscernible opportunities in the midatlantic region so it all kind of balanced out and i think as weve said all along that has been our strategy to have a very balanced ph approach to grow frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co thats helpful vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania ph frank sorry i dont have actual ph data on the portfolios frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co thats great vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania at my fingertips here frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co thanks for all the color and then just wanted to follow up on the guide specifically on fee income it seems like i dont know even if i can sort of normalize the other line item this quarter maybe and get things to mid number youre still sort of at already at sort of the midpoint of that run rate guide for next year and so just kind of curious if you can provide any puts and takes in terms of where you might see some growth in fees and where we could see some further weakness in fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2023 vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania i could comment frank just i guess high level noninterest income was solid again at million for the quarter down slightly from the third quarter mortgage banking income coming down million which is kind of normal seasonality there one thing i did want to point out too is that its important that the growth in the balance sheet of adjustable rate mortgages has been higher with the portfolio and more loans that we might otherwise have been selling in the past so the fee revenue is a little bit lower on the mortgage banking side now capital markets for the quarter were very solid at million we had higher contribution compared to the third quarter partially offsetting that reduced contribution from mortgage and second consecutive quarter with strong syndication fees as you look ahead some of that revenue sources are lumpy right the syndication fees are always consistently at the same level they kind of come in lumpy the swap fees also can be a little bit lumpy so us guiding to mid again which is what we guided to for the fourth quarter is really just kind of a function of that as well as we made some changes to consumer deposit fees we had announced in november so thats also kind of rolling through the number so its kind of a conservative look i would say based on kind of what we know today but the lumpiness you cant predict with certainty as far as some of the kind of capital markets components so thats why we guide at that kind of mid level ph thanks frank vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania indiscernible a stat on the carolinas over the last three years the carolina markets both north and south carolina produced roughly of our net loan growth frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay great vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania ph just another statistic that can help you size the ph importance of that frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co yeah no i appreciate that then if i could just lastly just youre getting closer and closer to that cet1 ratio and just wondering if any sort of strategic changes we can expect when you do reach that level and pass through it and i guess specifically wondering about additional capital return that this could trigger greater buyback activity as we go as we move through 2023thanks vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would just say we expect to build the in the near term here given the ph amount of earnings that weve been generating really creating that capital flexibility weve never had in the past so fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2023 regarding buybacks i mean our first and best use of capital as weve said all along strategy is the same is to deploy it into loan growth so depending on how strong the loan growth is or how much it slows down well have more opportunity to do buyback so its clearly on the table for as you know we remain committed to managing capital in a way that just fully optimize shareholder value fully aligned with shareholder interest so we will be looking at that well be opportunistic as we go through the year i think in total we have about million or so of capacity remaining within our former programs so clearly as we expect to build past that level the share buybacks were definitely something well be pursuing and evaluating on a daily basis frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co great okay thanks for all the color guys operator and our next question comes from jared shaw from wells fargo securities please go ahead with your question jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey guys good morning how are you vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah maybe starting with vince your comments on utilizing analytics to help drive the deposit base can you give us some examples of how youre doing that i mean your deposit performance has been really strong your beta among the best in the group so far i guess how are you getting that and is that going to be a sustainable level or a sustainable avenue of growth as we go forward vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah this is vince delie actually vince he mentioned that in his comments and i will tell you weve made a significant investment in our ability to analyze large quantities of data weve talked about that before we even got we have an entire team that manages governments and the systems weve invested early and heavily in that area over the last five or six years we use that team to basically give us a better understanding of the types of clients that we have and to really drill into client behavior expectation and it enables us to be able to provide them with better solutions and the answer on the deposit stability and growth i think were an outstanding deposit franchise i think if you look at the mix the mix is very strong relative to the peers the stability of the demand deposit base is very strong the granularity is strong so theres quite a bit that goes into managing a deposit portfolio that size theres not just one silver bullet so we focus we use analytics to focus on treasury management opportunities within our fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2023 customer base we use the analytics to view customers that are singlesource or singleproduct customers that may have a loan product but dont have a fuller depository relationship with us we use the analytics tool to tier the clients based upon need and that helps us direct our resources more effectively to drive growth we also use the analytics tool with our digital offering so that we can present products and services to clients as they engage the estore online and i mentioned in my comments we had views on the website and on the mobile app because our estore is embedded into our mobile application so its right there for the customers to engage with that all of that helps us manage the betas and the deposit outflows and deposit growth and the mix of the deposit so its a pretty complex set of strategies that we deploy and the tactics that underlie the strategy in each segment really are geared towards driving better performance in that deposit portfolio hopefully that answers your question thats pretty flawed but jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah yeah that was vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania indiscernible goes on jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc that was great color maybe looking at margin you project or you expect ph a couple more basispoint hikes whats your expectation for dda diminishment in that scenario and are you taking any steps to protect margin if we start shifting to more of an expectation for lower rates in the future vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would start with just the noninterestbearing deposits again were a big focus in the company so our ability as you can see here in my prepared remarks i mean ddas were down or so the last for the quarter that takes a lot of effort all the pools that vince talked about analytically as well as our team on the front line and our relationships with customers that are very strong weve created a lot of goodwill going to ppp during that process with existing customers and new customers that weve been broadening relationships with so that those relationships and our customers willingness to talk to us and if theyre looking to move money instead of just moving money is very valuable and our team on the front line has been very active throughout the fourth quarter talking to customers we have a large corporate initiative thats been on the lending side as well as the deposit side and just been bearing fruit during the quarter so our goal is to sustain the ddas and to grow them here we have a slide in there that shows the percent of ph core deposits from up to our team is incented to work hard to grow those noninterest bearing deposits vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2023 we have a lot of tools in place but why dont you mention also our active assetliability strategy focused on preserving margin spread vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would say we as you would expect i mean our treasury team studies it daily i mean weve been looking at hedging opportunities really for the last year and we did some small amounts from hedging probably six months or so ago but decided not to put more on because of where levels were and what was expected to happen with rates you dont have to go back that far when everybody was locked in that rates are just going to fall off a cliff one quarter or two quarters into the year and then bring a indiscernible protection and that became very expensive so we put some on our naturally our asset sensitivity has been kind of approaching neutral if you look at the assetsensitive interest rate risk position youre down to like or so for plus100 minus100 so organically its been kind of coming down as weve been deploying cash its just kind of the natural movement of the balance sheet so well continue to monitor jared but at this point the price points havent made sense to us to load up on hedges for the balance sheet but well continue to look at it and well be smart about it when it makes sense and if it does make sense to us well put ph something out weve done about billion or so of receive fixed swaps over the ph recent period so we have that component there but the natural asset sensitivity coming down and as you know our net interest income is at a much higher base so its kind of coming off of that so having that lower interest rate risk or more neutral interest rate risk position is a positive and indiscernible to move forward so we continue to monitor as we have and evaluate any hedging opportunities that make sense but the main deposits are always valuable and in this environment even more valuable so our teams success in growing those ph noninterestbearing deposits which is key for us that will always be a focus jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks ph just followup for me just on the capital management side whats the appetite for ma here and maybe vince whats your view of sort of the current state of bank mergers overall vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania i think i wouldnt want to be an investment banker in the short run here i think its been a pretty challenging environment i investment banking fees like in general were down given whats happened with aoci in investment level it becomes very challenging to do a deal thats accretive that doesnt have substantial indiscernible elements to it and weve stated repeatedly that were not interested in diluting tangible book value we have as vince said we have capital flexibility that weve never had before which could mean a number of things i mean we could become more aggressive in buying shares back at loan growth as well as indiscernible if you look at the dividend payout ratio on an operating basis were down to unheard of i mean when we took the reins here vince and i we were like to payout ratio so we have incredible flexibility moving forward we want to make sure it benefits our shareholders so our focus is just driving shareholder fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2023 returns and making sure that were making smart decisions with capital so that we can move the stock price up and repatriate appropriate levels of capital ph at some point thats the strategy moving forward jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania jared just to go back on the interest rate risk on slide we did have a chart there that shows the interest risk sensitivity over time and you can see kind of how its moved down we have a plus200 plus100 ph sharp gain you can see how it organically has come down ph closer to deal flow by the end of the year point that out too operator and our next question comes from casey haire from jefferies please go ahead with your question casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah thanks good morning everyone vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey casey casey haire q analyst jefferies llc i have a question on the funding strategy so the guide outlines about billion of loan growth with deposits flat i just want to understand whats the outlook for funding that loan growth be it bond book or borrowings vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah we still have some excess cash casey to put to work so well deploy that as we go through the year i think if you look at the loantodeposit ratio whats in our guidance and kind of in our plan we get down to maybe or up to by the end of the year which is still a very comfortable level for us so the combination of deploying the cash and we might have some small level of borrowings as we get towards the end of the year but overall loantodeposit ratio very comfortable at those levels casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay very good and just i guess as a followup to that is what is a comfortable ph main cash position for you guys as well as what is too high a loantodeposit ratio vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2023 well i mean in the past i remember when we got up to about we started to get uncomfortable and we took some actions at that point some promotional cd programs and those types of things to kind of bring it down so i think thats the level but our prior history that was when we decided to start doing them so i think if you got up to 95ish then we would look at other options or strategies we should deploy at that point vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania we have many tools at our disposal casey to drive deposit growth the question is how much margin you want to give up indiscernible casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay very good and vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania and to casey just to clarify casey too i dont have a figure in front of me so theres billion if you look at our balance sheet at the end of the year of noninterestbearing deposits so that cash being deployed to support the loan growth would be the first place you would go casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yes understood okay and then apologies if i missed it any update the cum beta is coming in very nice surprise positively versus what you were expecting this year any updated thoughts on where cum beta ends up vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah in my prepared remarks casey i mentioned kind of low at the end of the third quarter and if we look at kind of overall i would say well a few comments on betas right i think our team has done an admirable job in the field strategically managing interestbearing deposits for us while were building noninterestbearing its a lot of effort as you would expect its daily effort talking to customers managing the relationships being smart about raising rates for customers that have kind of full relationships so its been a very active process it will continue to be an active process for us we ended the year as you saw on the slide at getting down into the low by the end of the third quarter and then if you look at kind of the midpoint of our guidance by the end of the year kind of cumulative total beta would be in the high is what were kind of projecting as we sit here today versus about in the last ph hiking cycle casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay got you apologies i missed that so high through the cycle is what youre thinking vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania at the end of the year yeah ph its pretty kind of through fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2023 casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay all right just last one for me maybe one for gary so the provision guide of million to million you guys do mention a softer macroeconomic environment were all kind of struggling with cecl modeling just wondering if any color in you can provide on what how softer that macro is be it unemployment rates gdp et cetera gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah its pretty much across the board casey and during the quarter we also saw some softer economic forecasting in our cecl models which impacted the provision to the tune of about million so weve got that built in through so that is a pretty good portion of where weve guided to across the year the other naturally is the other naturally is loan growth as far as the indiscernible there and loan growth will move those numbers a little bit within that range as weve talked in the past casey haire q analyst jefferies llc thank you operator and our next question comes from daniel tamayo from raymond james please go ahead with your question daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc thank you good morning everyone vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania

you say that million reserve build is what was built into your assumptions for the provision gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania no the im sorry the million was cecl macroeconomic forecast changes in  fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2023 daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc okay okay i apologize all right terrific do you have a thought on kind of how much reserve build is in the guidance relative to what would be just loan growth or chargeoff activity gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah cecl impact is about a third loan growth is about half of it daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc okay all right thank you and then maybe we could just talk a little bit more about the margin i know we talked a lot about deposit betas but just interested in your thoughts on actually the pace of the margin we can kind of back into what the rest of the what the would look like based on your guidance but just interested in terms of if you do continue to get expansion in the first quarter and kind of how much how accelerated the contraction youre expecting after that point would be vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i can comment on that danny the outlook just to restate again includes an additional basis points of hikes in february and march with no additional fed actions for the rest of the year our guidance would imply a slight increase in margin from the level that we were at in the fourth quarter peaking into the second quarter based on whats in our plan but were talking single digits of basis point movements there so theres still some upside to that level and then similarly on the other side comes down a little bit from that ph cecl but were talking in the single basis point type level so that was ph baked into that daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc okay great vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania indiscernible daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc great terrific and then i just wanted to again clarify an earlier comment i think you said the midpoint of your expense guidance would assume that you are would be under efficiency ratio in i just want to make sure that thats what i heard and if there was kind of a i had an original question like how likely you think it is that you do stay under but i guess assuming your expenses come in about where you expect you would expect that to be under is an accurate statement vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah using the midpoint of our guidance kind of across all the different categories thats youre very right thats an accurate statement fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2023 daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc okay and is that kind of becoming a longer term goal for the bank to stay under efficiency ratio or and if we get into a lower rate environment you think that might drift back over vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania i would say our goal would be to continue to reinvest in the company and with the changes in the margin based upon macroeconomic factors it could swing back and forth over under vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah low i would say would be a reasonable longer term kind of low to mid vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania but i will tell you that there will be capital investment required as we move forward particularly in technology for us to stay competitive for us to maintain margins in the future and to keep doing what were doing with the betas and its not a ph free pass forever so we have to keep watching what we do and were going to have to manage the margin as you know were in a very good period with our organization weve been part for this time were benefiting but obviously the world is going to change so were ph building on expense inflow and we continue to reinvest in the company sorry i didnt ph know vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania no no no thats great i would just add to that i did mention the kind of cost savings target for which is million as you know were a ph disciplined manager of expenses we continue to invest as vince said in a variety of initiatives on the digital side and de novos and some of our kind of digital infrastructure and then one thing i would add in the past ive talked about kind of project improvement process improvement i should say weve always had a focus on that renegotiating with vendors facilities space optimization but the process improvement side of it weve recently reorganized a little bit internally adding some additional resources to drive this corporatewide focus on process improvement i think theres a lot of opportunities deploying rpatype technology to really drive further efficiency as we go forward and were still in the early stages of that but that also will contribute yeah i think allowing us to have sustainably in the low as you move forward given all those efforts daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc terrific thanks for all the color thats all for me vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2023 thank you danny operator our next question comes from michael perito from kbw please go ahead with your question michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning thanks for taking my questions yeah obviously you guys covered most of it just a couple quick ones to wrap this up here just vince in terms of the kind of geographic footprint you mentioned a little bit about some pipeline and some stuff from like the carolinas et cetera but just as we look at kind of the spread of the bank today any opportunities or areas of focus for you guys in that we should be mindful of maybe something like philadelphia where theres been a lot of midcaps taken out over the last couple years just anything kind of like that that you got thats on your radar that you would convey to us at this point vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i mean i will tell you this we have studied philadelphia from a commercial lending perspective we do have an office there our plan is to continue to expand it we think theres some opportunity there in the middle market large corporate space i also think philadelphia when we ran our model when we looked at msas because of the number of companies domiciled there and the competitive climate it scored out pretty high the dynamic keeps changing there are fewer competitors right so were seeing it as an opportunistic area to expand and there are several other markets that we launched into that well continue to bolt onto weve had tremendous success in charleston our plan is to continue to grow there we are looking at de novo expansion in richmond weve studied opening a loan production office commercialonly in atlanta and those are pretty much the areas that were focusing on but nothing earthshattering or theres no indiscernible retail de novo expansion but i think there are opportunities for us to extract additional highquality growth in our existing footprint where we may not have the density and then the other thing that weve done strategically was to substantially increase our atm rollout what we found is that thats helped us immensely with the retention of customers growing indiscernible expanding small business opportunity so weve done that through both branding opportunities and direct placement of atms and itms so our atm network grew more than across our footprint so we have atm locations so of those were rolled out in north and south carolina and then another in maryland virginia baltimore washington dc northern virginia washington dc so were trying to supplement our physical delivery channel in the form of branches with other channels to distribute cash and then were marketing our estore which enables individuals and small businesses to open accounts online anyway thats the strategy and i think from a geographic perspective theres plenty of opportunity within our existing footprint for us to continue to grow michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2023 yeah i mean that makes sense so from the outside looking in it would seem like especially around the corridor like virginia like you mentioned philadelphia like theyre a lot of the competitors there they were much more loaned up right probably a lot less willingness to lend deposit betas are a lot higher the balance sheets are a lot smaller it would seem like you guys have a pretty attractive value proposition for some lending talent in those markets coming from the west and south as opposed to coming from the new york area where theres just more balance sheet constraints vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah and i think our treasury management offering at least as it scores out through greenwich and other surveys is pretty wellrespected so that enables us to go in and garner deposits as well we go in we become the principal banks we get the operating accounts we crosssell treasury management services and i think weve proven moving into the southeast that our products stand out pretty well if you look at the noninterest income growth of the company a lot of that was driven from our expansion into the southeast and there was quite a bit of skepticism about our ability to compete i think weve put that to rest and if you look at the growth in various categories its been fairly substantial and its been very robust so we have the product capability as well to go into some of the markets that we dont have density in within our existing sevenstate footprint michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks for that vince and then just last for me just on the effective tax rate guide it says assumes no investment tax credit activity can you just remind us quickly what the activity looked like last year and just also if you do move forward with any transactions there what you guys typically look at from an opportunity standpoint vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania ph yes so vince c answer go ahead vince vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would just say i mean its a line of business for us we dont have some transactions each year i mean in i dont think we had we had one in we had maybe a couple in so i mean theres an active business process there and we may have some this year we just dont want to put it in the guidance if we do then its a positive additive to the guidance there so michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc its just that like housing income tax credit stuff though or is it like more like what type of vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania renewable energy yeah renewable energy tax credit ph partner is michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2023 renewable energy okay vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania typically solar they have a long indiscernible period so theres a long it takes a lot of time to get to the finish line so theres some supply chain issues with the solar panels so thats elongated some of those projects michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc perfect thank you guys vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania all right thanks vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you operator and our next question comes from brian martin from janney montgomery please go ahead with your question brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey good morning guys congrats on a nice quarter vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey brian brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc ph thanks for taking the questions just one clarification i think it was vince vince youve mentioned the pipelines just can you i guess was it im not sure if you were speaking more to the commercial the consumer just give us an update on what those pipelines i know theyre a little bit softer but just connecting the dots there just whether it was commercial or consumer just kind of how theyre trending here vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania this is vince delie and i was speaking specifically to commercial indiscernible not consumer so brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2023 vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania and what i said we had two very strong quarters in terms of production that tends to you have to reset were moving into a slower seasonal period so our pipelines are down and even given all of that when you look at it on a comparable basis taking seasonality out of it were still down to vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania and theyre rebuilding vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania and theyre rebuilding the pipelines vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thats just something that indiscernible illustrates where we are economically i think theres a lot of uncertainty i think our borrowers are on the sidelines for a little bit here to see what happens right and its going to be a little while until we start to see that build back brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay then the consumer vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania ph thats probably brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah into second quarter and then on the consumer side how is that trending today vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah consumer pipeline theres seasonality there as well so its kind of tough to say i think the pipelines in general have been pretty consistent where theyve been seasonally maybe down a little bit mortgage theres more production coming on line in terms of opportunities for us to take on adjustable rate mortgages on our balance sheet so were seeing growth in that category fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2023 direct consumer were seeing a little bit of slowness in the indiscernible space now but that tends to build back up again as we move through the normal housing sales season home improvement season starts to pick up here at the end of march so its a little tough to tell brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc small business is up vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania small business is up pretty much across the board i mean we have some good momentum in the number of markets that weve entered we have a fairly sizable portfolio indiscernible with the total bank its not its over billion but relative indiscernible commercial portfolio is much identical were seeing some really good positive momentum in the carolinas in the midatlantic group and the ph middle east so brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you no thanks for the color and maybe just one or two others just on the inside the guide on the fee income side just kind of your thoughts on mortgage obviously being kind of a low point for the year and ph kind of just trying to as you think about next year i guess can you give any thoughts just on high level on how youre viewing the mortgage activity given kind of what we saw throughout the year vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i think im going to turn this over to vince in a minute but i think ph on the phase of brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc no go ahead vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania basically the mortgage business weve always on a track globally what the expectations are from a number of statistical sources that tell us where growth is expected to be we tend do a little better not a little better we do a lot better than what the typical forecasts are so i attribute that to the geographic dispersion of our originators weve had great success in certain segments as well physicians the physicians program that we had that portfolio has now grown substantially it was over billion so theres little pockets that we go after but theres also certain markets that tend to have better housing markets generally than our legacy markets like the carolinas and the midatlantic region where we have originators dispersed i think well probably outperform the market overall again this year i would expect that i think that the servicing portfolio that we have has been a good hedge for us from an earnings perspective vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2023 within the quarter yeah vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania so thats helped us but go ahead vince youve got a couple of other ph factors vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i was just going to add that look at production overall from the fourth quarter million seasonally down from third quarter but its now so it fell off a cliff and then to vinces point i mean the highlevel industry forecast right now is for production originations to be down baked into our expectations and our guidance its more like a down kind of so we would expect to outperform the industry like vince said and we have done that in the past and well continue to do that brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay so a little bit lower ph honestly you target yearoveryear is kind of what youre looking at there right vince vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah full year to full year brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay perfect and then vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania and just one more thing i mean we have with the lowering of the 10year interest rate we have seen a pickup in lockup volume in both mortgage and in the consumable just saying that brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah no that makes sense vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania ph brains do have a brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay yes and just to remind me i guess on the deposits theres been a lot of talk about the beta what did you guys exit the quarter on the costtodeposits i guess i know you talked about the betas where they trend to but for like the month of december where were the i think you said loan yields were i thought theyre for the quarter the origination yields but the cost of deposits as far as exiting in december where were you guys there fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2023 vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah total deposit costs ended december at basis points and interestbearing deposits ended the year at about brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay perfect then last one for me was just on the deposits you guys talked about the guide being relatively flat just the mix i mean i know you talked about the work it takes to keep the deposits where they are just where you are now on the dda as you kind of look throughout the year i mean do you expect that number to come down a bit is that kind of in your forecast or i guess do you think the efforts you guys have can you can kind of maintain this level youve reset to vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania were going to work hard to maintain and grow that source of funding for us honestly i mean theres been some mix shift into cds as you would expect particularly in the municipal and commercial side i mean theres been some shifting into cd the key is that its still kind of staying in the house so its moving around a little bit and the noninterestbearing deposits like i said earlier its a big focus in the company with existing clients but also bringing in new clients vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah but you really we have to see how things play out throughout the year i mean theres going to be pressure on noninterestbearing deposits with ph this intermediation within the existing book as we move into a period of extended high rates brian so were going to have to work really hard brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah oh yeah vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania but i think weve outperformed at least what weve seen reported recently and were going to keep doing what were doing to maintain those balances to the best of our ability because that really drives our profitability through the next year brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc and youre in a much higher base now with all the efforts you guys have had here over the last year or two with the money taken indiscernible fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2023 vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania right considerable granularity within that noninterestbearing deposit base so we theres some hope there brian brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc right i got you okay thanks guys nice quarter indiscernible operator so our next question comes from manuel navas from da davidson please go ahead with your question manuel navas q analyst da davidson companies hey good morning most of my questions have been answered but could you just give me a reset on the physicians first portfolio you said its about just over billion ph caught up in yearoveryear growth what are like new loans

and we use that the estore to promote the product digitally and weve done very very well i mean i can tell you the cagr on this portfolio is fairly significant since we started in ph so its grown nicely we started with originators first and then we supplemented their effort with the digital offering and set up a campaign if you just look at households with physicians were up in eastern north carolina and midatlantic region alone so weve had some good success in those markets i the full year production was over billion so its been the portfolio stands at billion at yearend so the program has worked very well for us and those are highvalue households in that we feel confident that with our digital capabilities and our analytics well be able to continue to penetrate that household with additional products and services so its a good program for us the credit quality is stellar in that portfolio so fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2023 gary l
