position remains strong at inclusive of the discounts the nonowner cre portfolio credit metrics continue to remain at satisfactory levels with delinquency and npls up slightly at and basis points respectively the earlystage delinquency increase was primarily related to several performing credits that had matured and were in documentation a number of which were renewed in the normal course of

operating net income totaled million or per share when excluding the million loss on the indirect auto loan fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 sale and million software impairment million of performing loweryielding indirect auto loans were sold as part of our ongoing balance sheet management strategies loan sale positively impacted the loantodeposit ratio by approximately basis points and the cet1 capital ratio by approximately basis points excluding the loan sale total loans and leases increased million or linked quarter for a periodend balance of billion consumer loan growth of million excluding the loan sale was led by residential mortgage originations as volumes remained elevated given the pullback in mortgage rates during the third quarter commercial loans and leases grew million linked quarter in line with our expectations given the significant level of commercial loan closings in the second quarter and reflective of lower revolver balance total deposits ended september at billion a robust increase of billion or linked quarter benefiting from our successful deposit initiatives which demonstrate the value of our granular deposit base across a very attractive geographic footprint third quarter deposit growth was led by a billion increase in interestbearing demand deposits and million increase in time deposits the mix of noninterestbearing deposits to total deposits totaled at quarter end compared to last quarter reflecting the strong interestbearing deposit growth and noninterestbearing deposit balances remaining fairly stable around billion last quarter i discussed our goal to reduce our loantodeposit ratio organically through slower loan growth and deposit seasonality alongside several loan and deposit initiatives our team has implemented success of our ongoing balance sheet management and deposit gathering initiatives led to a loantodeposit ratio of at september nearly a percentage point improvement from at june we expect the loantodeposit ratio to be relatively stable in the fourth quarter as deposit growth continues to be a strategic focus net interest income totaled million an increase of million or from the prior quarter primarily due to earning asset yield increasing basis points to and higher loan balances as well as a favorable mix shift in interest bearing liabilities as total borrowings decreased billion or linked quarter this was partially offset by the cost of interestbearing deposits increasing basis points to continued growth in higher yielding deposit product balances third quarters resulting net interest margin was stable with the second quarter margin since the fed began raising interest rates in march of our total cumulative spot deposit beta equaled on august outperforming our peers through the rate hiking cycle we continue to manage our balance sheet towards a more neutral position as interest rates are lowered since the feds decision to reduce the federal funds rate by basis points in september we have strategically lower deposit pricing on several deposit products including our current cd and money market promotional offerings at quarter end we have nearly billion of nonmaturity deposits that are currently priced at or above and a 77billion cd portfolio with a ninemonth duration and billion maturing in the fourth quarter of at a weighted average rate of additionally we have billion of shortterm or floating rate borrowings with an average rate of and around billion of swaps that mature beginning in january of with rates between and basis points turning to noninterest income and expense noninterest income reached an alltime high of million a increase from the prior quarter capital markets income increased million with broadbased contributions from syndications net capital markets customer swap activity and international banking mortgage banking operations income decreased million from the strong levels in the prior quarter driven by net msr impairment of million in the third quarter of due to accelerating prepayment speed assumptions given recent declines in mortgage rates offsetting the increase in saleable production volumes total income increased million reflecting higher life insurance claims operating noninterest expense totaled million an 84million increase from the prior quarter after adjusting for the significant items the largest driver for operating expense was a 51million increase in salaries and employee benefits due to fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 productionrelated variable compensation and lower salary deferrals even reduced on balance sheet mortgage production as well as strategic hiring associated with our focus to grow market share and continued investments in our risk management infrastructure marketing expense increased million tied to the timing of opportunistic marketing campaigns for successful deposit initiatives we continue to manage our expense base in a disciplined manner as we prepare our budget we are working on a number of costsaving initiatives to bring revenue and expense growth into better balance with some of the incremental expense growth tied to revenue growth the efficiency ratio remains at a peer leading level of for the third quarter up slightly from last quarter fnbs capital levels reached all time highs with a tangible common equity ratio at and cet1 ratio at providing flexibility to deploy capital and create shareholder value on a yearoveryear basis tangible book value per common share increased or to demonstrating our commitment to internal capital generation lets now look at the guidance for the fourth quarter of loans are expected to grow midsingle digits on a full year basis inclusive of the loan sale total projected deposit balances are expected to grow midsingle digits on a yearover year basis up from the previous expectation of lowsingle digits our projected fourth quarter net interest income is expected to be between million and million assuming a basis point rate cut in november and another basis point rate cut in december given the continued strength of our noninterest income generation the fourth quarter expectation is between million and million we anticipate fourth quarter noninterest expense to be lower than the third quarter level and were guiding to a range of million to million fourth quarter provision is expected to be between million and million dependent on net loan growth and chargeoff activity lastly the full year effective tax rate should be between and which does not assume any investment tax credit activity that may occur as we have previously mentioned renewable energy financing transactions are part of our leasing company business model with deals in various stages and sizes in the pipeline with uncertainty on when the recognition of the investment tax credit will occur with that i will turn the call back to vince

shareholders for their support thank you and we will now open the call up for questions question and answer section operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions at this time we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster the first question comes from frank schiraldi with piper sandler please go ahead frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co thanks good morning you know obviously always a good time to be bringing in core deposits but could you just talk about the average rate youre seeing on these inflows and vince you mentioned moving towards a neutral a more neutral interest rate position wouldnt all this growth on the deposit side work against that a bit at least in the near term vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would say a couple of things you know as we said last quarter we had significant growth in short term borrowings to fund this very strong loan growth that we had in the second quarter so the goal was to bring in meaningful deposits and we did i mean we brought in billion of new money in total it was billion billion of new money around at rate and nature of those deposits are very shortterm combination of money market and very shortterm cds fivemonth cds so we have a lot of flexibility as we move forward to reduce the rates on the liabilities we brought in i think it positions us well from a loantodeposit ratio we were in the our goal was to bring it down and we brought it down meaningfully to and if you look at kind of the balance sheet as a whole as we sit here at the end of the quarter we have billion of liabilities that are repriceable today subject to market forces of course about billion and we have another billion in cds that mature in the next six months billion of that in the next three months at a rate and then we have billion in cash flows from the investment portfolio that kind of rolls off around to and they were investing between and so theres a lot of levers obviously there that help us reprice with the fed moving basis points in september kind of bigger than maybe what was expected that has an impact on our loan portfolio over a threemonth period so well be kind of playing some catchup there but we have the levers here that can kind of offset that and our team is very wellpositioned and weve already started to bring interest rates down we brought rates down basis points on our cd offer and a variety of different deposit categories fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 weve started to bring rates down and kind of ready to continue to bring rates down so i said a lot there but we have feel that we have the levers positioned well moving forward so that we can kind of adjust as rates move down frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co right okay and then you were i think fnb was a bank that was pretty conservative in your expectations of deposit beta on the way down at least i mean in the first few rate cuts so just wondering now that weve seen that basis points you mentioned youve already cut you have cut some deposit rates any updated thoughts on what a sort of early deposit beta could look like for these first few cuts through the end of the year vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would say our guidance has obviously the basis point plus two more basis point cuts kind of baked into that what our guidance implies is like a beta by the end of this year id like to think we can do better than that lets say were all everybody is geared up to be able to adjust prices a lot of our competitors have been lowering rates so that theres an ability to do that so kind of whats baked in is and our goal would be to do better than that by the end of the year frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay and then just lastly on the indirect auto sale just kind of thoughts on additional opportunities on the balance sheet here was any of this kind of moving the credit box a little bit or and at this point are you looking to just exit this business given the yields vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah were not looking to exit the business we we saw an opportunity for us to move some lowyielding assets off the balance sheet was not a credit play it was more about managing the overall balance sheet and particularly in particular our loantodeposit ratio we looked at it basically with our deposit with our ability to generate deposits and coupled with the sale of those loans we were able to bring it down fairly substantially and there were some questions in the last earnings call about our ability to do that and our ability to grow deposits in this competitive environment i think we proved that were capable of doing those two things i would say that in the normal course of business in that indirect auto portfolio there will be loan sales from time to time weve always used to this kind of a way to manage the balance sheet and manage our loantodeposit ratio its you know weve done it a number of times but we retain the servicing so were still maintaining the clients we do use the information on those clients to try to crosssell other services to them so that works pretty well for us but its not it was not a credit play vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania its a very shortterm asset i mean twoyear life to it so from an income statement standpoint given the borrowings we paid off theres really no impact on earnings on a go forward basis and it it add added capital cet1 ratio we picked up basis points and just that alone added or reduced the loantodeposit ratio by basis points so its attractive indiscernible fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania its an attractive transaction and you know it helps with capital and essentially puts us in a much better position to support our clients i think loan demand will pick up just based on the earnings calls that ive listened to and read about it seems like credit is more benign than folks would have thought and the economic environment is a little better i think theres a lot of wait and see right now once we get past the election i do think irrespective of who wins therell be demand in the ci book in particular so we want to be positioned to take advantage of that and i think frank the other thing is on display here over the course of the past year and during this last quarter great financial institutions are able to fund themselves and theyre able to generate deposit balances and weve talked about our business model weve talked about leveraging data analytics and how were positioned in the markets and the prominence that we have in the markets our share in the markets there have been a lot of theres been a lot of talk among some of the larger bank ceos about the inability for midsized and regional banks to gain share weve proven that wrong so our business model works weve grown share if you look at pittsburgh i mentioned it we passed up the legacy mellon bank franchise here with deposit share so just in the last turn and those are real customer deposits so were doing very well in regard to acquiring names were doing well at becoming the primary client which is why our demand deposit balances have been sustained at around billion others have seen migration at a much faster pace all the things weve said that are embedded in our business model have proved out in this quarter so i just want to emphasize that and i know weve said it over and over again i think the proof is in the results frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co all right great i appreciate all the color thank you vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you frank vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks frank operator the next question comes from russell gunther with stephens please go ahead russell e t gunther q analyst stephens inc hey good morning guys i was hoping to vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning russell russell e t gunther q analyst stephens inc fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 start on good morning guys on expenses if you could just revisit results for a minute what the drivers were that took you guys to the high end of the prior guide and then provide some color around the bracket for is that simply tethered to fees or what could keep you towards the higher end of that range vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania sure expenses on an operating basis for the quarters came in at million the guidance range we provided in july was million to million the key drivers to that were a couple things million increase in marketing which we decided to do to grow the billion in deposit so that was something that we obviously was a strategic decision to spend some more money on marketing bring in the deposits and it worked very well and then million increase in comp benefits that was driven by a few things higher productionrelated incentives the success weve been having on the noninterest income side theres commissions related to that deposit raising and the fee income we mentioned in the release opportunistically hiring some producers in some key markets for us and investing in risk management staff just to support our continued growth and then just for fun we had an extra work day in the third quarter thats another million so those were kind of the drivers to get us a little bit above the range but if you look at the efficiency ratio we continue to post topquartile results i mean last quarter we were which we were the third best among our 21bank peer group this quarter is and i think well compare well again and then as you go ahead to the fourth quarter so were using a range of million to million up million from the prior guidance but and its a few things continued variable compensation supported the strong noninterest income seasonally slower loan production in effect the fas91 cost deferrals would be lower fdic insurance levels kind of staying at a higher level and then the impact of the hiring but you step back overall the absolute level in fourth quarter we expect it to be down from the third quarter which is key russell e t gunther q analyst stephens inc yeah okay thats a great color vince i appreciate it and then maybe just looking forward or taking that conversation forward you guys remarked about bringing revenue and expense growth into balance so as we look to is positive operating leverage something you guys expect to be able to deliver or do we really need to see a fed easing cycle and deposit cost catch up to drive the efficiency more meaningfully lower and deliver positive operating leverage for vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania no i would say obviously getting to a more positive slope yield curve later next year will make a difference so i think having it for some portion of versus is definitely achievable but i think having that yield curve will be kind of the key driver of getting us there vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah having an appropriate slope in the curve drives our if you look at our balance sheet and how were positioned we perform extraordinarily well in that environment so that is key to our success obviously in that were no different than other banks but if you look thats the ultimate scenario for us in terms of profitability so hopefully we see some adjustments on the short end of the curve ph against the slope of the curve and the appropriate position for us to benefit fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah thatll drive meaningfully higher net interest income and net interest margin as you move forward and get to that point russell e t gunther q analyst stephens inc got it okay understood and then just last one for me you guys reiterated a midsingledigit growth guide for the year as you guys look forward is there any optimism for being able to accelerate that pace or are we should we be thinking about headwinds like paydowns or potential additional portfolio exits that would keep you guys at a midsingledigit ph clip vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania i dont think were in a position right now we havent given guidance for next year but i would look back historically i think weve done a very good job over a long period of time ive been here for almost years in this seat years overall i think weve grown loans and deposits just about every year ive been here maybe the pandemic was a time when loans didnt grow one quarter but weve put up pretty consistent organic loan growth its in the mid to high singledigit irrespective of the size of the balance sheet over time and as weve grown the balance sheet we shifted our strategy to move into markets that would provide us with opportunities right so we could sustain our growth trajectory irrespective of the size of the balance sheet so i think thats played out over time so im i cant say im optimistic because theres so much uncertainty about next year but i do believe that were in the best position of anyone to generate that loan growth once the market comes back demand picks up in a way that is a growth scenario put it that way russell e t gunther q analyst stephens inc yeah no understood guys thank you very much for taking my question vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yup thank you vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks russell operator the next question comes from timur braziler with wells fargo please go ahead timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning circling back on vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 good morning timur timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc the deposit acquisition strategy just looking at the new money cost this quarter at i mean thats still dilutive to the overall rate im just wondering as we look into and i had just the composition of the deposit growth and the basis point reduction in cds is that off of that level or is new money acquisition still north of here vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i dont think were going to get into specific strategies around how we price so that our competitors dont listen in but i will tell you that youve got to look at it in total while that is the new money rate coming in thats basically on the money market vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thats money market and fivemonth cds so sure vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania so yeah cds and the money market that are driving that there is a component of demand deposit theres a runoff now or shift in mix but we are bringing in primary clients so we do have operating accounts as well that have the rebalances so i would expect us to be able to benefit as we move along and then i also would note based upon your comment that its not accretive it actually we replace shortterm borrowings that were at a much higher rate vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania ph much higher vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania they were so it actually was beneficial so the way i look at it scott and i go back and forth depending on the interest rate environment scotts our treasurer i basically say hey id rather have clients new clients than rely on wholesale funding or some other source of funding thats institutional in nature so this trade was actually a very good trade for our shareholders vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah bringing loantodeposit ratio down as much as it did gives us the flexibility to be able to actively reprice rest of the portfolio so theres vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 and im going to say it again because in the context of the competitive environment were in we are not outsized from a pricing standpoint relative to our competitors so our business model is working and we are driving share in the market in a way that is accretive to our margin and our profitability so and over time having new clients we have the flexibility to price according to changes in the market so it ultimately leads to higher profitability on a perclient basis as well anyway thats the strategy behind what we accomplished vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would just add one last thing too is we have a meaningful pipeline on the commercial side of additional deposit accounts that were going after and pursuing and weve had great success in the past quarter and theres still a very meaningful amount that were going after to bring in new relationships timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you thats great color there and then just maybe again circling back to the auto sale or indirect auto loan sales just any kind of underlying characteristics of the loans sold i guess how did you choose which portions of that portfolio were divested this quarter vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania ill let gary answer that question because that actually reports up through gary gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah timur it is just a acrosstheboard sample of current transactions in the portfolio that portfolio sale did not include any account that was past due so it was highfico highquality paper with an average life of two years timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great and then just lastly for me theres been some growing speculation of midatlantic ma your name kind of into the mix just would love to get an update as to what your thoughts are around capital deployment going forward and where ma might fit into that mix vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania okay we havent changed our position weve indicated in the past that we are not looking to deliver tangible book value in a material way i dont think that i dont want to comment on specific transactions but were still focused on doing deals inmarket smaller in size if that was even available to us were being opportunistic in terms of whats out there so inmarket acquisitions with cost saves are on the list the deals would have to be immediately accretive to earnings with limited tangible book value dilution as ive said and then the return has to be well above our cost of capital so no i dont think weve deviated at all and there are a lot of rumblings out there but were going to stay true to our strategy i think its weve done well over the last few years focusing on tangible book value accretion and returns and thats going to be our focus as we move forward timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 great thanks for all the color vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah thank you gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks timur vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks timur operator the next question comes from daniel tamayo with raymond james please go ahead daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc thank you good morning guys vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning dan daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc maybe just starting on the guidance for nii for net interest income just some clarification trying to get a sense for what the margin compression could look like to fit into your guidance is there on the balance sheet side is there something that was in the third quarter in terms of the pace of growth that would impact the average balances in fourth quarter is that something where you you could see that number come down just trying to think about rightsizing how to get to the margin number vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania i think it goes back to what i said earlier danny about the implied beta thats in there right so the fed moved basis points in september and we only had a partial month impact of that so you have the full quarters impact of that and then theres two more so i think theres some conservatism in our nii guide but were using a beta by the end of the year we can do better than that and theres upside to that we dont have any other portfolio exits or anything like that teed up as we sit here today so well just be kind of normal activity for fourth quarter like vince said earlier theres some seasonality to some slower activity and then you have the uncertainty with the election and everything so no theres still some level our midsingle digit guidance on the loan side is still the same guidance that weve been giving so theres nothing unusual its just us managing the rates down we get between now and the end of the year fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc okay understood so the average earning assets likely increase in the fourth quarter and its a margin issue in the fourth quarter before we start to see that stabilize at some point next year is that fair vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yes and i would just say that i would characterize the margin as flattish i mean if its down its down a few basis points not a lot so just a starting comment daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc okay all right thats helpful thanks and then maybe one for gary on the kind of the credit environment specifically just net chargeoff environment obviously you got volatility a little bit higher in the third quarter but just interested in your current thoughts around how you think about what might be a good run rate for net charge offs for the bank as you think about the next the near term gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania you know daniel i think that were very aggressive from a risk management standpoint and staying ahead of our clients with information flow and understanding their position and the risks in the portfolio weve continued to perform exceptionally well from a risk management and a chargeoff perspective and all the credit metrics have been at or near record low levels for quite some time now this quarter we were bps on a yeartodate basis basis points which is really really strong result in this environment which continues to be a bit uncertain and as we all know the cre environment is truly continuing to see some stress here so i would expect continued performance as we have put up over the last number of years and is it going to edge up a touch i mean it may normalize but i feel very good about where we sit and as we look ahead continuing to outperform from the industrys perspective vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania gary and his team have done a fantastic job of making sure that the risk ratings are current so he mentioned gathering the information i think that where we stand today is where were going to stand tomorrow basically with the exception of any major shifts in the global economic environment so were not going to be sitting here with surprises lets put it that way we do a pretty thorough job of underwriting and assessing risk ratings on a frequent basis stresstesting and evaluating risk so what you see is what you get and i think thats a thats been true for a very long time for us and gary has done a fantastic job so keeping us there daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc all right terrific well thanks for all that color vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania all right fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 operator the next vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you operator the next question comes from kelly motta with kbw please go ahead kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning thank you so much for the question i hate to beat a dead horse but i just want to button up a few more things on the margin on the prepared commentary about the beta by the end of the year just a point of clarification wondering if thats interestbearing or total deposit beta one and then two i know you havent done the budget for next year but just from a high level wondering how you anticipate deposit betas on the way down more broadly as you look ahead past this next quarter vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah that kelly is total deposit beta by the end of the year and weve talked about historically kind of a mid level on the down kind of we have some statistics we look at from the past cycle so thats kind of whats in our head so i dont know by the end of next year could be around 30ish i would say kind of as a level total again total deposit beta by the end of next year is kind of whats in our heads at this point kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thats very helpful and then on the loan side of things just wondering what youre seeing in your markets and in terms of how spreads might be holding up for commercial loans and if youre seeing any differences between how thats performing in the carolina markets versus into your more legacy midatlantic markets vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania surprisingly its fairly consistent across the board and you would expect it to be different regionally as your question implies but it has been fairly consistent i think with capital exiting the cre space theres a little more pricing flexibility in that bucket you know if you find a highquality cre opportunity youre able to get a little more margin out of it today thats a function of banks pulling back and financial nonbanks pulling back as well so i would say theres not a lot of demand from a ci perspective kind of across the board right now everythings on hold i would expect that to change as we move into next year i dont have a crystal ball but my gut and years of experience tells me that theres quite a bit being held back so i would suspect that moving into next year well be able to see a higher level of demand particularly for ci i expect that to happen and then on the consumer side i consumer home equity and direct installments been pretty benign i would expect that to pick up a little bit as well and our mortgage company has done a remarkable job of gaining share pretty much across the board so we would continue to i hope continue to succeed there i dont know if that answers your question but it its pretty fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania much same the margins are the same based upon the risk profile pretty much across the board kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thats interesting thank you thats very helpful and then on the expense again i know its too early to start talking about next year but one thing you have talked about is the double carry of the rent expense with the build out of the new headquarters just wondering the timing of that if thats still kind of on track to i think it was about million come out of next year as you move over to the new space vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i dont know that its actually million but it the buildings on track were scheduled to move in on november i think is the date i think we picked the worst possible thanksgiving i dont know what it is but its thats when well all be moving over there you know well have nearly employees moving into one location were in seven buildings here on the north side of pittsburgh were scattered all over the place if i think well eke out efficiency just by being together in productivity our people are in the office pretty much so i think that will help us immensely that rent that we talk about thats basically because we had a year of free rent right so that gets built baked into the total length of the lease gets carried out over the lease according to gaap accounting and we still have rent expense in this building so thats why thats occurring if youve forgotten so i would expect that to come back portion of that million its not the total amount but a portion of it will be coming back next year now there might be demand for additional space its going to be hard to see i cant lay that out applestoapples but theoretically yes we should be receiving a benefit from a gaap accounting perspective the other rent is noncash kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it okay thats helpful i appreciate all the color ill step back vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah thank you thank you kelly vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks kelly fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 operator the next question comes from manuel navas with da davidson company please go ahead excuse me mr navas your line is open is your phone muted accidently okay well go to the next questioner then the next questioner is brian martin with janney montgomery please go ahead brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey good morning guys vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey brian vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey brian brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey its just one question just on the going back to the deposits for a minute vince and the success of this quarter the dda did come down a bit and i know you guys have talked about kind of being the primary bank for your customers and then also the new commercial vince you talked about that you see opportunities on i mean does that i guess is your expectation that that stabilization in that level is still kind of a way to think about the dda as you kind of look at the next couple quarters here at that level or do you see it drifting lower from where its at today vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania look the mix moved down obviously were in a period where you see some outflows in the demand deposit category plus we brought on a lot of new money so its going to shift but weve been running at around billion pretty consistently so you saw as rates went up we were able to maintain that i believe as rates come down we should be able to maintain it and grow it over time so i cant speak to the overall if you look at the total deposits and you look at demand deposits as a percentage of the total sure its going to be smaller but that billion in noninterestbearing deposits has really been beneficial to us and if you look at our cost of funds overall and compare it to peers we can match up pretty well so thats the main reason so i would say we have opportunities to grow the noninterestbearing category because as customers grow and we brought new clients on and were able to stand up all the treasury management services in these balances to pay for services where theyre dispersing funds out of operating accounts that we have well have a pickup in demand deposits over time but theres still its a very difficult environment to maintain demand deposits because anybody that has excess balances is looking to get a higher yield right indiscernible versus where we were during the pandemic when everything was close to zero right theres nowhere to go so but i think weve done well and i would expect us to continue to do well in that category vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 yeah plus we brought in a lot of indiscernible gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania well i was going to say brian we also saw about a reduction in revolver balances which also is going to impact dda balances moving from the dda to pay down some debt as customers being cautious during these times with everything thats going on in the election on top of us did make some decisions to pay down some revolver balances so theres a slight impact there as well vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania good point gary vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah and i was just going to add weve added a lot of new names brian too on the retail side with new households plus new commercial clients that once we have them its an opportunity to broaden those relationships and thats been a focus over time really to be the full bank for our customers brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah got you okay all makes sense and then just in terms of vince i think you seem optimistic at least on the loan growth next year i guess just nothing immediate from the first rate cut that we saw which is like you said a bit more than maybe people thought any pickup in just dialogue with your customers kind of getting the sense that theres that optimism for next year on the loan growth side and i know you guys will give more color next quarter but it seems like a handful of people other banks have said that first rate cut really dispersed some new interest from their customers and didnt sound like you were getting that sense yet maybe the election and getting past a few things here vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania im not as close to the customers as i used to be but interacting with the bankers and talking with some of the clients im not seeing that yet to be honest i think its still kind of lets wait and see and theyre expecting additional costs so there may be dialogue but theyre thinking hey im going to get a much better opportunity down the road here because everybody is signaling that there will be additional rate cuts right so im not seeing everyone leaping forward and saying im going to take advantage of this 50basis point reduction i think theyre kind of sitting back and saying hey lets see how the election plays out but a lot of things can happen post election corporate taxes are on the table all kinds of things that impact our clients are on the table so theyre going to sit back and say hey i want to wait and see whats happening and thats kind of what im hearing and seeing and again i dont have as much insight as maybe i dont know gary if you want to add anything gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania vince i would agree with everything that you said thats kind of the way it feels right at the moment i would expect based on this period where we are here preelection that once we get into and the middle part of the year when things start getting quite active that well see some stronger demand fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania and ive been out the last few months brian i mean ive been in winstonsalem ive been all over the place winstonsalem ive been in ohio around pennsylvania so im hearing the same thing im not hearing anything different brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania but again i dont have the picture i mean i might be getting biased information i dont know brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah and maybe just one on the margin it sounds like and maybe just vince can remind us what the immediate i think you went through some of the stuff that reprices but the immediate on the loan side what reprices and then it just sounds as though secondarily the i guess if you maybe the expectation is to see a little bit of pressure here on the margin modest in the fourth quarter and then if you are neutral i guess the expectation is you can kind of keep the margin relatively stable and then as you get into next year and if you get the yield curve steepening you get some pick up later in the year is that just in general how to think about that vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i think you said it perfectly fine indiscernible but to your initial question slide does a good job laying out the moving parts just to remind everybody thats you see in the chart there of the billion that reprices on the loan side over a threemonth period and as i mentioned earlier if you look at the levers that we have we have billion of liabilities that are repriceable today we have another billion in cds that will mature in the next six months million in the next three months at a rate and then billion in cash flows in the investment portfolio that its coming off at and being reinvested today at least between and so that kind of gives you the key moving parts that are there brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay yeah and then i think you mentioned vince or somebody mentioned on the call some hiring that you guys had done on the maybe on the fee income side maybe just if you can just point us to what youre doing there and then just one just modeling question it sounds like the fee income this quarter the bolis maybe i dont want call it nonrecurring or and then the there was also a negative you said on impairment on the mortgage that vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania that kind of neutralizes fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah it was an msr impairment of million vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania so they offset each other if you look at brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah its a offset okay vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania the fee income brian brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah okay vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania no its not brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay and then just the hiring that youve done i guess there is an area youre focused on was it capital markets vince that you talked about as far as i think there was some comment about hiring and im just trying to understand where there might be more vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah weve added you know weve added folks yeah we replaced people in certain markets weve uptiered with the replacements you know we had thats one area thats driving a little bit of the increase in the salary expense so weve been able to bring some really talented people and then weve been building out our risk management framework and we stood up an operating efficiency group for our operations area because we felt that with the changes that are going on with ai and our investment in our data hub were going to be able to drive efficiency in operations so we hired we made some changes there was a press release that was put out but we brought in some very talented people some process engineers to help us drive efficiency and improve customer satisfaction and deal with risk in the back office so while thats not a frontend hire that should benefit us over the long haul vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania ph to scale fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania and thats really whats embedded in the increase in the run rate of expenses salary expenses its not as large as the total amount that were reporting because theres all kinds of pieces in there some of its directly related to production right higher production in those fee income areas were paying out commission but i think were putting ourselves in a pretty good position moving into next year both with funding right so if there is a pickup in demand keeping that funding short short duration in our strategy so we can reprice down take advantage of the changes in interest rates that occur and then investing in areas that produce revenue and create efficiencies so those are the factors that drove all of our decisions brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay that should be it for me and i guess just remind me from a sensitivity standpoint are you guys youre pretty neutral is that what i heard i guess nothings changed then on the sensitivity of where you guys are at today vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania no i would say i mean were still asset sensitive but were clearly moving towards neutral i mean all the different levers ive talked about brian brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania so if you looked at our 10q it still shows asset sensitivity but i would say were more neutral than what the rate calculations show and towards that yeah brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah okay perfect thanks for taking the question guys vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania all right thank you vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks brian operator and we have a question from manuel navas from da davidson please go ahead fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 manuel navas q analyst d a davidson co hey can you guys hear me now operator yes we can please go ahead indiscernible manuel navas q analyst d a davidson co so a lot of my questions have been answered but can you just dive a little bit more into where youre seeing the market share gains in deposits what geographies are driving it best and kind of where you expect continued momentum vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah we saw some fairly indiscernible carolinas was doubledigit you know i think thats one area weve had great success pittsburgh we continue to have success i think because we have such a huge market share here it feeds on itself i mean we now have the scale to be able to compete effectively here and bring new clients on and ph better relationships and thats still happening so that were benefiting there in the central part of pennsylvania weve done extraordinarily well so we brought in indiscernible there and then as you move into the midatlantic region weve had some success in the markets that were expanding into and then also charleston south carolina and the south carolina market that were moving to ph should get good results for us those are its pretty much i guess its pretty much everywhere i think weve done well in a bunch of markets but i would say the carolinas and the central part of pennsylvania is probably leading the charge right and then pittsburgh vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah we had growth in of the msas that we operate in and from a either increase share or maintain it was of the msas that were in so i think yeah very good result and then in the carolinas we had increases in six of the markets that were in there so it was very indiscernible vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania i was just referring to the increase quarteronquarter i wasnt referring to vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania the market share data yeah vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 the market share data but its pretty consistent its pretty similar story manuel navas q analyst d a davidson co to shift for a second if we do get significant rate cuts by middle of next year whats kind of the fee upside we see youre gaining new relationships in the carolinas could that convert quickly to improved mortgage business can you just kind of talk about that fee upside with lower rates vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah the mortgage business really hinges on for us it hinges on demand because were a big purchase money lender so hopefully theres more housing supply out there more people decide to sell but i think thatll be good i think the swap income that we get from commercial customers somebody else asked the question i think it was brian what are you seeing out there one thing that i can tell you is that the customers that are looking to go to a fixed rate swap theyre watching whats going on and theyre not moving yet because theyre hearing repeatedly in the media that theres additional cuts coming so that when you dialogue with them they say well im not going to do anything yet but i think that business has an opportunity to grow i think our syndications business over time will have opportunities because therell be more ma particularly in the middle market and the lower end of the middle market which plays favorably for us weve also were also expanding several areas were getting into the advisory business were building out our public finance capability so there are things that will need to be generation in that we dont even have today so i think and they wont be it wont be gigantic but it will have an impact anyway those are the things were thinking about as we look forward vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania and then debt capital markets is at record here vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah debt capital markets obviously has been good and that should continue right because and the numbers gary mentioned online utilization weve looked at the larger clients and really have very few capital markets events driving reduction in revolver balance which is why you said gary said hey thats going to zap your demand deposits right our clients are using their cash balances to pay down debt moving into this next quarter so thats what weve seen and theres probably a little bit of reset going on within the customer base and their balance sheets theyre preparing themselves too for whats coming anyway thats so those areas manuel navas q analyst d a davidson co thank you i okay thank you i appreciate all the color vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah thanks manuel fnb corp
