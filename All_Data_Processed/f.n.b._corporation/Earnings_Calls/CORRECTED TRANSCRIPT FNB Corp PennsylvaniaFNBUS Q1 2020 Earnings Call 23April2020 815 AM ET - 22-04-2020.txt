president and ceo vincent j delie jr chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning and welcome to our earnings call on todays call id like to address three key topics first ill begin by providing an update on how we are navigating our business through the covid19 pandemic while supporting our employees customers communities and shareholders secondly id like to briefly comment on a few points about our first quarter financial performance and finally id like to revisit several key strategic initiatives and programs our companys existing pandemic preparedness plan and ongoing pandemic exercises enabled fnb to stay at the front of this escalating crisis dating back to our management team went through a pandemic simulation and collaborated with our business continuity team to develop a formal pandemic response plan during this process sustainability was thoroughly evaluated and ultimately formed the foundation of the comprehensive plan currently in place additionally our ongoing commitment to invest in our digital channels and technology play the critical role in our ability to provide convenient banking options for our customers who are not able to leave their homes our investments in technology also enabled us to build and establish an automated process to handle nearly business applications for the sba paycheck protection program in just one weeks time our efforts resulted in approving and processing of those applications in the first round of funding representing billion in loans we anticipate processing the remaining applications during the second round of funding as i mentioned when phase one of fnbs technology initiative called clickstobricks began we had previously introduced online appointment setting and were able to quickly make specialized covid19 content and offerings available in our solutions centers we tapped into the strength of our established communication channels for both customers and employees keeping both audiences informed of any updates our employees response to this crisis has been exceptional their professional compassionate positive and resilient attitudes have been a bright light in helping each other our customers and our communities while navigating these unprecedented times protecting the health safety and financial wellbeing of our employees remains critical as we find ways to address any impacts to their health or the health of their families for example fnb provided our team with up to days paid leave and also expanded our existing paid caregiver leave program additionally to assist with any possible financial hardships resulting from the coronavirus fnb provided a special assistance payment to essential employees working on the frontline and in our operations areas to ensure that our customers continue to receive vital financial services we also leveraged our it infrastructure by making accommodations to give employees the ability to work remotely where appropriate to date we have approximately colleagues working remotely which represents about half of our workforce and largely nonretail position this capability also speaks to our investment in technology and it infrastructure as we focus on our communities the fnb foundation committed to provide million in relief in response to covid19 benefiting food banks and providing essential medical supplies many of our employees began fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 reaching out to our clients and our communities to provide support at our pittsburgh headquarters fnbs

retail branches we have focused on drive up services and closed our lobbies reverting to appointmentonly practices which are supported by the appointment setting capability within our clickstobricks platform as you can imagine the monumental commitment of our leadership team and employees to operate in this challenging environment required a sustained 24x7 effort id like to commend our employees for the actions theyve taken to execute and abide by our safety measures while continuing operations with these key priorities and actions in place let me pivot and comment briefly on our first quarter performance given all thats happened in a noisy quarter our underlying core performance remains solid our philosophy is to maintain our approach to risk management through varying economic cycles and serve as the primary capital provider to our clients while fnb like many banks will be subject to a difficult economic environment this philosophy and the actions we have taken to strengthen our balance sheet and reduce risk should position fnb well as we move through the current crisis looking at the quarters results gaap eps of included of bottom line impact from significant items primarily related to covid19 and the adoption and implementation of cecl and the corresponding reserve build under these macroeconomic conditions top line results were solid as revenue increased to more than million driven by strong loan and deposit growth and positive results across our feebased businesses average commercial loans grew million or as we saw activity pick up in latemarch particularly in ci with growth of ill note there was limited impact to average balances from the anticipated liquidity draws compared to the first quarter of average deposits increased with growth in noninterestbearing deposits of leading to an improved funding mix the net interest margin expanded to supported by strong loan growth a 7basispoint improvement in total cost of funds and higher accretion levels compared to the prior quarter the fundamental trends in noninterest income were strong with capital markets revenues of million setting another record in the first quarter insurance and mortgage banking income also had strong underlying performance due to the significant shift in the interest rate environment our noninterest income includes million of impairment on mortgage servicing rights excluding changes in msr valuation mortgage banking income totaled million up more than from the first quarter of with significant pipelines moving forward on a core basis expenses remain stable compared to the fourth quarter and disciplined expense management will continue to be a top priority as we move beyond this crisis vince and gary will provide more detail on the implementation of cecl and additional details on the financials in their remarks with that ill turn the call over to gary gary l guerrieri chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you vince and good morning everyone we closed out the first quarter of with our credit portfolio remaining in a satisfactory position in the midst of the current global challenges that have come as a result of covid19 the first quarter also marked the adoption of the cecl accounting standard which as i communicated last quarter brings additional changes to the reporting of credit quality metrics i will also review the steps we are fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 taking to monitor the book and manage the emerging risks while continuing to meet the credit needs of our borrowers and the communities in which we operate lets now review our first quarter results the level of delinquency at march totaled up basis points over the prior quarter and included a temporary uptick in early stage a majority of which has already been brought current npls and oreo totaled basis points a 9basispoint increase linked quarter this increase does not reflect credit deterioration but rather changes in nonaccrual reporting moving from the former pci pool accounting to the new cecl standard net chargeoffs remained low at million for the quarter or basis points annualized provision expense for the quarter totaled million of which million relates to the reserve build for adverse macroeconomic conditions tied to covid19 the ending reserve stands at up basis points compared to our dayone cecl reserve of providing npl coverage of at quarter end its worth noting that inclusive of unamortized loan discounts our period ending reserve represents of our dfast severely adverse scenario chargeoffs our teams have been working tirelessly over the last several weeks meeting with borrowers reviewing credits tracking performance metrics and administering governmentbacked lending programs as part of our response to the covid19 crisis we entered the crisis with our credit portfolio in a position of strength due in large part to our core credit philosophies that i have discussed with you before including consistent underwriting proactive management of risk attentive and aggressive workout and a balanced asset mix spanning our entire footprint we have taken many actions over the last several years to maintain a lower risk profile to position our book to withstand various economic cycles and adverse conditions similar to those we are currently experiencing over the last four years we have sold approximately million in loans to proactively derisk the balance sheet a large portion of which were higherrisk acquired loans that we were able to move off the books at a financial benefit to the company weve also historically limited our exposure to highly sensitive industries like travel and leisure food and accommodation and energy with exposure to these three industries remaining very low totaling only of our loan portfolio as it relates to relief programs we were able to quickly mobilize our credit teams to review and approve payment deferral plans for qualified borrowers which to date totals approximately of our loan portfolio as an sba preferred lender we have also been working diligently to support our small business borrowers in securing ppp financing that is fully backed by the sba the volume and key performance metrics for these relief programs are monitored daily through a specialized set of reports developed in response to covid19 using our holistic credit systems we have been tracking daily utilization rates deferral activity ppp loan volume and borrower impact assessments which are broken down further to allow us to monitor our credit portfolio by line of business loan product geography and industry in addition to expanded analytics we have also leveraged our existing allowance and dfast frameworks to conduct scenario analysis and stress testing including select loan portfolios all of the actions taken will help us manage through the challenging conditions faced by the industry today above all i would like to take a moment to recognize our team of bankers and credit support staffs for all of their hard work and dedication to help meet the credit needs of our customers and communities during this challenging time well continue to draw on the leadership and experience of our credit and banking teams to manage through this challenging environment as we have in past cycles fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 i will now turn the call over to vince calabrese our chief financial officer for his remarks vincent j calabrese chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks gary and good morning everyone today ill cover our results for the first quarter and provide an update on the current environment as noted on slide sic slide first quarter gaap eps totaled which includes of significant items the tce ratio ended march at reflecting basis points of cecl adoption impact and another basis points for the million of aftertax items these significant items are listed in the reconciliation tables with the biggest piece being the covid19 related reserve build of million during the first quarter we used a pandemicdriven recessionary scenario in evaluating the macroeconomic projections lets start with a review of the balance sheet on slide linkedquarter average loan growth totaled million or annualized attributable to commercial growth of and consumer growth of the average commercial growth includes less than percentage point annualized for covid19 related increases in commercial line utilization that occurred in the month of march continuing on the balance sheet slide on a linkedquarter basis average deposits were relatively flat as normal seasonal outflows impacted average balances on a yearover year basis average deposits were up billion or from an overall liquidity standpoint we are comfortable with our current position including the benefit of opportunistically accessing the debt capital markets to raise million in holding company liquidity at very attractive spreads on february we also executed a portion of our previously announced share repurchase program buying back million shares prior to march representing of our total shares outstanding turning to the income statement on slide net interest income totaled million up million or from last quarter the net interest margin expanded basis points to driven by solid average loan growth lower cost of funds and higher discount accretion levels now that we are in a cecl environment during the first quarter the higher discount accretion offset the pressure on variable rate loan yields given the significant decline in the short end of the curve on the funding side the total cost of funds decreased basis points to from reflecting lower borrowing costs as well as a shift in funding mix and a 10basispoint reduction in the cost of interestbearing deposits slide and provide details for noninterest income and expense there continues to be strong performance in capital markets mortgage banking insurance and trust as well as for operating noninterest income as a whole as vince noted earlier we are consistently receiving positive contributions from our feebased businesses which diversifies our revenue base and helps to mitigate the impact of a volatile interest rate environment looking at the first quarter noninterest income totaled million a decrease from last quarter due mainly to the impact from the million msr impairment given the move down in interest rates excluding the impairment noninterest income increased million or with capital markets posting a record million increasing from the fourth quarter driven by strong origination volume turning to slide noninterest expense on a run rate basis remains stable compared to fourth quarter levels this excludes million of expenses associated with covid19 million of branch consolidation costs and million of expense related to changes in retirement provisions for new grants under our longterm incentive program that do not affect the total cost of the grants but do affect the expense recognition timing bank shares and franchise taxes increased million reflecting the recognition of a million state tax credit in the prior quarter and higher yearend bank capital levels while other increases and decreases essentially offset each fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 other the efficiency ratio equaled compared to as the other unusual or outsized items increased the current quarters efficiency ratio by over percentage points regarding guidance the outlook we shared in january is no longer relevant given the impacts of the covid19 pandemic on the overall economy and the uncertainty around the length of time it takes to recover however in the spirit of transparency into our shortterm forecasts we are providing our current directional outlook for the second quarter of on slide based on what we know today which is subject to change given the very fluid situation were all managing through we expect second quarter net interest income to decline midsingledigits from first quarter levels as the net interest margin reflects the full quarters impact of the current interest rate levels we expect average loan balances to be up mid to highsingledigits reflecting higher march spot balances and billion of ppp loans from the initial phase of the program that are expected to fund during the quarter the second phase of the program would be additive to these figures as we strive to accommodate all of our customers that want to participate we expect expenses to be flat from the core level of million in this quarter we expect our core fee trends to continue from solid levels in the first quarter where service charges expected to decline due to covid impacts on certain products and services we expect the effective tax rate to be around with that i will turn the call back to vince vincent j delie jr chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks vince id like to touch on several initiatives that stand out as we move forward in january we launched our new interactive website designed with enhanced functionality that creates a onestop shopping and interactive digital experience online appointment setting a streamlined account opening process and deploying interactive teller machines throughout our footprint are just a few of the functionalities that our clickstobricks digital strategy affords us combined with our network of nearly itms and atms and our robust awardwinning mobile application we are well positioned to continue to provide service to our customers through multiple channels and meet their needs during this time of social distancing and economic challenges weve invested heavily in our mobile and online platform which is critical during a time of limited operations in the physical channels mobile deposits are up more than in the last two weeks of march compared to the yearago period and precovid19 first quarter levels fnb will continue to build out our digital capabilities as previously planned to protect our customers and communities from economic disruption fnb was one of the first banks to develop a structured deferral program and announced several measures to support customers who may be enduring financial hardships and were directly impacted by covid19 furthermore we instituted an outreach program and activated an outbound calling initiative to contact thousands of customers across all business units during the crisis ensuring their needs were being met we also continue to participate in the previously mentioned paycheck protection program and evaluate other covid19 related federal government relief programs to determine their suitability for our customers and communities regarding our outlook liquidity and overall capital position we consistently run stress test for a variety of economic situations including severely adverse scenarios that have economic conditions like current conditions under these scenarios our regulatory capital ratios remain above the threshold and we are able to maintain appropriate liquidity levels demonstrating our ability to continue to support all of our constituencies under fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 stressful financial conditions as we gain more clarity on this evolving health pandemic and the resulting challenging economic environment we will continue to update you on key business drivers and expectations in closing id like to express how proud im of our teams efforts during this very difficult time to identify new and creative ways to connect with those in need this is an unprecedented time for our nation and our industry our mission has always been to improve the quality of life in the communities we serve now more than ever we must work together to support those impacted by this public health crisis as such i want to again say thank you to our employees and all those serving on the frontline in our communities who are making a difference as we navigate through this together question and answer section operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from jared shaw with wells fargo securities please go ahead jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc good morning guys vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning jared vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc first on the margin you walk us through some of the moving parts as you look out into second quarter i would think that with the strong growth in ppp that would offset some of the pressure in second quarter i guess maybe on the ppp are you accounting for those fees or do you anticipate account for those fees through nii and then what is the blended fee rate on the billion that you have there vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania sure i can make a few comments jared so just kind of walking through the outlook for the net interest income going forward as weve talked about it in the past the changes in onemonth libor and prime have a significant impact to our net interest income and margin if you look at where our average libor was for the last couple quarters and projection for this quarter was in the fourth quarter in the first quarter and projected to be around on average for the second quarter we have billion in liborbased loans and another billion as primebased so the projected move down obviously impacts those loan portfolios now offsetting the impact we continue to reduce the rates on our interestbearing deposit costs as weve talked about were projecting another 33basispoint reduction in the second quarter from first quarter levels and then fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 we will have benefits as you mention from the ppp program as we fund this quarter the billion youll have our average fee rate were estimating is around is how that would kind of calculate out when you go through the tiering the spread is basis points so kind of an allin margin is around for those loans the way were going to account for it is you put them on the loan system kind of loan by loan so its accreted in over a twoyear period and then once the loans are forgiven and paid off you would bring in the remainder of the fees into interest income at that point in time jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania and then lastly the last piece i would comment on to is just the accretion that we had this quarter indiscernible through in kind of a cecl environment versus the prececl environment so it was about million this quarter its up about million from the fourth quarter so that contributed to the first quarter i dont expect it to be quite at that level in the second quarter but i dont know because its a function of prepayments and with under the cecl accounting theres a lot more variables that get factored into that with prepayments being a big contributor so i still expect it to be a meaningful contributor in the second quarter just not quite at that as high as that million if you look at the last third and fourth quarter of last year we were running to basis points from accretion its probably a reasonable run rate subject to change based on what happens with prepayments during the quarter vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey jared a couple of other points on the ppp program of the applications that we brought in we have kind of originated an average loan size of about so were on the lower end of the spectrum in terms of size with more small businesses coming through that pipeline we still have that are still out there that totals about million that we processed and are ready to be processed in round two once the funds are available and we would expect some additional fundings on top of that just in the spirit of transparency weve also funded about of the billion already so theyre closed and on the books jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay on the loan growth this quarter did i hear you right did you say that there is only of the growth was from increased line utilization or was that line utilization went up vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania no it was on average right so the line utilization occurred later in march that we would have had so on average its of the growth that i mentioned the average balance growth gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 yeah hey jared i can add to vinces comments there our usage was running around a little over prior to the covid impact it peaked at just under as businesses build some cash positions were already back down to so its really getting close back to a normalized level at this point vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania but we really dont have a significant amount of large corporate exposure that essentially was funded up either to put liquidity on their balance sheet or to back up commercial paper offerings we dont have a tremendous amount of that in our portfolio so the liquidity draws were much lower than what others would have reported jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great thanks and then just finally for me the sorry on the deferrals you said that of total loans are in deferral are you seeing any concentration in either category of loan or geography gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah right now were at about we expect with the pipeline to be at about or just a touch over based on the pipeline that we have in terms of those deferrals were seeing those in the industries that you would expect restaurant travel tourism those books are very small from our perspective as weve strategically really not had a focus on lending into that space as weve talked in the past so its really concentrated kind of there vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania and if you look at the dispersion of deferrals its all its pretty similar across the loan types in terms of percentage or the size of the portfolio right gary i mean its ranging around to is pretty much where it is gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania right vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania so its pretty consistent that were not seeing a spike in one particular area jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay right thanks for the color gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thats helpful fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah thanks jared operator our next question comes from frank schiraldi with piper sandler please go ahead frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies good morning vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning frank vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning frank gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania hi frank frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies just curious on if you can give any more detail gary around stress testing and if we sort of think about the baseline outlook how loss expectations stack up to the last cycle to at the legacy bank i guess excluding indiscernible back then gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yes frank what i would say to you is that we have been very proactive and strategically have derisked the balance sheet over the last number of years like i mentioned earlier and were coming off some very solid chargeoff levels over the last months naturally the world has changed we expect that consistency in the underwriting that we talked about with you all the time on the frontend to play a meaningful role as we go forward here in terms of chargeoffs all banks are going to experience credit deterioration as is typical in any downturn and this one is rather severe at this point in our last stress test we remained well capitalized and expect to be able to fully execute our business plan from a chargeoff standpoint under those adverse scenarios and to the extent that the forecasted economic conditions under the cecl methodology are worse then covid19 conditions are at this point that we used at march day so were using some very current covid information around our modeling we would expect any potential reserve build to occur from normal levels based on movements from this point in time so from a loss perspective were not going to forecast losses as we go forward but we do expect the portfolio to perform as well as possible through the cycle that were dealing with right now based on the consistency that weve talked about in the underwriting fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah and if you got to page in the deck frank there is a comparison on fnbs performance our net charge offs over average loans back historically gary maybe you could comment on that i mean it does exclude regency and the florida portfolio that we divested gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah so back in the and great recession that we all experienced a numbers of years ago on page you see fnbs performance through that cycle this is basically the core bank at that point in time it did exclude it does exclude florida and regency as those portfolios are now no longer a part of the companys balance sheet that consistent underwriting that we had in place back then remains today and we do expect that that will allow us to perform better than the industry as a whole as this cycle moves through itself frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies okay and then just back to the margin and nii guide for vince im sorry does that include any accretion in nii expectations or i dont know have you left yourself enough wide enough range there just curious vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania no it would include my comment earlier about kind of to basis points if you look at the third and fourth quarter kind of run rates which were prececl i would expect that to be kind of more normal run rate next quarter right again its a function of prepayments though prepayments end up being high again we would have more frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies right vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania so i think its kind of a reasonable number i would say frank and i truly wont know until the kind of quarter plays itself out but theres definitely that kind of to basis points in there for the second quarter thats baked into our number and then also i should clarify too that we mentioned the billion in the ppp activity thats on the books for two months of the quarter so you dont have twoone you have twothirds of that just from a modeling standpoint and thats included in the number too into the target frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies okay but i guess what wouldnt be included is if they are only on the books for two months well i guess its late in the quarter so you dont have anything from the being accelerated because some of the stuff is going to be forgiven nothing like that is in fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania no its just frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies okay vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania what it would include is normal accretion frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies right vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania within that twoyear timeframe its going to probably that forgiveness process probably going to get you to june frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies yeah vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania theres going to be indiscernible vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania i would expect it would get you beyond june frank frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies sure vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania so you probably look into the third quarter event theyre starting with the forgiveness items to go through vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yes i dont have any acceleration to that fee in my number frank fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies okay vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania its just kind of normal accretion twoyear period frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies and then just finally what is your expectation for libor in this guidance is it just sort of steadystate from here vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania so i mentioned in my earlier comments that basis points is kind of what were projecting i mean were in the i think were in the high right now so for the quarter on average basis points we started the quarter a little bit higher so thats whats baked into our numbers frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies got you i missed that sorry thank you vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thats okay sure operator our next question comes from michael young with suntrust please go ahead michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc hey good morning wanting to start vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey mike gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey mike michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc thanks good morning wanting to start maybe gary with just the additional covid19 reserve that you put up this quarter can you just talk about sort of the assumptions that went into that the macroeconomic assumptions and any weightings that you used or management overlays to arrive at that number fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania sure i can give you an overview of that were using the pandemic recession scenario where we see significant deterioration in the economy upfront with slight improvement later in the year and then a continued economic weakness throughout were not taking into account in our analysis any of the government stimulus programs around our modeling so there is no benefit from any of that we review and incorporate really about a dozen variables just like we always have in the dfast modeling scenarios that we continue to run and those variables include a few examples ill give you such as the dow housing consumer confidence levels gdp and unemployment are a number of the examples there but thats really whats driving our models and the analysis that weve done around the portfolio michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc and i would assume that was timestamped kind of end of march so conditions maybe have worsened a little bit since then if we stay on kind of a similar trajectory that would require more reserve build potentially next quarter just to stay on where we stand gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania we continue to run these scenarios weve run them as recent as the last couple days based on the update again our model was run as of the march timeframe and as of our most recent run with the updated data its really not a material difference albeit slightly but nothing material based on just simulated models that were running michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay and gary i think youve done a great job on the slide here breaking out kind of all the covid sensitive industries et cetera are there any areas that we should be particularly watchful of or that you think may have more nearterm risk than others whether itd be less liquidity less cash or more severely impacted collateral gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would say that from an industry standpoint naturally restaurants are severely impacted hotels are severely impacted energy is in a tough spot right now also being impacted these are some of the categories specifically hotels and the energy we do have a small restaurant book and some very good clients there we started lending into the hotel space years ago it was a strategic decision and its proven to be a very good one weve got some assets as weve talked in the past from the acquisitions we have derisked that portfolio and not been active in lending into that at all as for energy i mean you can see by the slide deck i mean were not an energy lender we got a few customers that are very sound as well as a few publicly traded entities there that continue to perform well but those are the industries that i would be initially concerned about as were in the early stages here and with all the uncertainty that everyone is still facing that have the potential to become a more problematic at a faster pace again strategically weve positioned ourselves and made decisions over time to maintain very very small portfolios there and i think thats going to pay dividends for us as we move through this cycle fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania and i think in the past we disclosed our energy related exposures back a few years ago right gary when there was a downturn i think it was about three maybe four years ago gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania weve cut that exposure in half so i mean i think its pretty evident that weve not been active in these areas i think you should comment on the retail exposure as well because as you look at operations in the current environment i mean its difficult for many retailers if you look at the granularity of our book as well on the retail side there are some segments within retail that are going to continue to perform right grocery theres a number of them in here gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah and i think thats an important point as well vince because that naturally there are concerns there a key point here the grocery gas station automotive that makes up twothirds of our retail ci book so thats a heavy dose of it a number of those industries have remained open as essential industries so we feel fairly good about the position of our retail book coming into this as well as working its way through a soft spot here from an economic standpoint michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay thanks operator our next question comes from casey haire with jefferies please go ahead casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah thanks good morning guys vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning casey haire q analyst jefferies llc i guess first question on the second quarter guide as it relates to the balance sheet is the should we just assume that earning assets track loan growth here because securities book was flattish and deposits were down just trying to get a sense as to what kind of balance sheet we can expect on the second quarter fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah it will probably be a little lighter than that because the investment portfolio we actually shrank during the quarter just given reinvestment i think we reduced it almost million to million during the first quarter so my guess is the cash flow on that is billion over months so i would expect that to kind of run down a little bit from there again a function of prepayments i mean were doing some investing just not fully reinvesting the cash flow so the earnings assets would be a little bit lower than that vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania i think you want to remember the balances the depositary balances for us are seasonal casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania indiscernible so it will build over time casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah understood and just on the loan growth i mean because billion is i mean thats of the earning asset base in the first quarter here and i know you had some line draws towards the end of the quarter so youre bleeding in positively on a core loan growth basis into the second quarter but what is the expectation for and it sounds like that utilization has come down so i guess my point is what is the core loan book whats the expectation for core fnb loans outside of ppp in the second quarter vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i think its a little tough to tell at this stage in the game i mean i think weve got a good solid customer base were not seeing a lot of movement i dont think anybody is really eager to move at this point so i would expect us to i would expect the balances that we have today to be pretty solid i think that the pipeline is still pretty good but like i said were kind of in a standstill because you cant really visit prospects i know that we are winning business in the marketplace for a number of reasons i think our execution on ppp was extraordinarily good relative to what ive seen we had a capture rate on our customers alone of and we had about new customers when we opened it up to new customers initially so the execution has been good and the comments have been pretty favorable so i would expect after this all starts to settle down later in the year that there will be acceleration in activity i dont know what else to i dont know if you want to add anything gary or gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i mean casey weve seen some good steady business throughout the last month monthandahalf from our client base i mean theyre still investing specifically around some certain investments that they had planned fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 a few of them have temporarily held those off but weve seen some pretty decent lending activity right through the last monthandahalf or so at this point vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania and its obviously you have to be careful because were in the midst of a crisis and we understand the impact that could have on financial performance of the borrower so were being cautious but casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania were i think were positioned pretty well as we move through this crisis on the other side casey haire q analyst jefferies llc understood and the tce ratio at at the quarter i know that ppp could put some pressure on that and it carries a zero risk weighting but you guys are a little bit more levered than most on that ratio what is your appetite how low are you willing to get that ratio let that ratio go vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania well were supposed to be growing that so that was our strategy prior to the crisis i think were again i think our capital position relative to the risk in the portfolio is good i think that weve mentioned weve stressed our capital position in a variety of scenarios including the pandemic scenario that gary mentioned so i feel pretty good about that i would expect as we move into the future to see an acceleration in the benefit of the fee income really helping us in the third quarter in terms of capital build because i think that youll see an acceleration hopefully in forgiveness on these loans as people comply with the requirements that will be laid out i mean theyre not out there yet but will be laid out so i think all of that keeps us in a pretty good place from a tce perspective and tangible book value per share perspective vince i dont know if you want to add anything or have i missed anything vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would just add a couple things i mean absent the ppp impacts we would expect that ratio to be slowly building on a quarterly basis to your point that was it was building so i think its important to remember that thats kind of whats underneath the temporary impact of the billion brings us down just under were comfortable with that for all the reasons that vince mentioned and the strength of the balance sheet and then whatever happens in phase two as far as the funding that would incrementally bring you down from there but billion brings you from basically to so its about basis points or so for a billion worth of those loans and again theyre temporary and as you know they dont affect the regulatory ratios at all but they do affect the tce ratio so were comfortable with that temporary level and then kind of rebuilding from there once those loans go back off the books fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay thanks just last one for me gary apologies if i missed this on your script but the forbearance and the modifications can you give us a sense has that at has that reached a peak and similarly like the line draws that they peaked and then they came back down just trying to get a sense for the pace of forbearance gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah just to clarify casey were at about right now and with the pipeline were anticipating that its going to get to just a touch over it has slowed dramatically at this point we do expect a continued trickle there but it has slowed dramatically from a commercial borrower perspective were still working through some of the mortgage portfolios at this point but that has also slowed as we sit today casey haire q analyst jefferies llc great thank you gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks casey vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks casey vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks casey operator our next question comes from russell gunther of da davidson please go ahead russell et gunther q analyst da davidson co hey good morning guys just a couple of followons gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning russell russell et gunther q analyst da davidson co good morning gary so for you i appreciate all the granularity just wanted to circle back on the covid19 sensitive exposures you called out restaurant hotels energy anything you could share from an underwriting perspective as to where ltvs and debt service coverage stands and then the followup would be you fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 mentioned internal stress tests that youre performing just curious as to what type of loss rates you would be assuming within those three atrisk buckets as well gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah in terms of the industries from an ltv standpoint generally speaking youre going to see low70 range around ltvs around those spaces and thats going to run fairly consistent across to our portfolio what was the second piece of the question russell russell et gunther q analyst da davidson co just any detail you could share gary in terms of the internal stress testing that you mentioned in your comments and assumed loss rates within some of the more atrisk portfolios gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania okay vince is going to cover that vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would just say russell i mean that we wanted to put that out there so just to restate what was in garys note so if you include the unamortized loan discounts our period end reserve at march is of the severely adverse chargeoffs over nine quarters from the last stress test that we did just to put it in perspective that its a significant reserve against those chargeoffs and we havent really disclosed all the different pieces or the different loss rates but what i can tell you is we hit it very hard in that severely adverse scenario and have every time weve done it russell et gunther q analyst da davidson co i appreciate it guys thank you for taking my questions gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania certainly russell thanks vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you operator our next question comes from collyn gilbert with kbw please go ahead collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning everyone fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania hi collyn vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania hi collyn gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey collyn collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc just to stick to the credit discussion for a second so if we kind of assume gary you mentioned kind of of youre seeing in terms of deferrals right now i guess thats like billion do you know how much of those deferrals would be included in that i guess roughly billion of sort of covidsensitive loans that you classify in slide gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah in terms of the deferred loans in the retail ire book its a total of million the food and accommodation is about million and let me find the lodging here the lodging is about million and the retail right at about million collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then the rest is just im guessing just smaller granular numbers gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thats correct collyn collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay okay all right thats helpful and then just wanted to clarify vince on the nim just to make sure i got these numbers right so the actual accretion dollar amount that you guys saw this quarter was what if we compare that to like the million you guys saw in the fourth quarter vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah it was million million collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 okay okay so then on the core nim basis is that i guess that would imply maybe then the core nim fell about bps in the first quarter is that right the core nim would settle out at like vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah if you excluded that i mean its kind of all in there right as we go forward into cecl environment so the million im trying to think of a hang on a second yeah i guess thats about vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thats about right vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania about to what is it about to basis points would be million is basis points of margin so yeah its around collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania around basis points or so collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay got it okay and then just lastly on kind of the loan growth discussion im trying to reconcile gary kind of your comment about the pipeline and you still have some customer activities still flowing through but yet obviously theres a lot of activity that also come to kind of a screeching halt but then just thinking about kind of i guess capital markets it sounds like i mean you obviously had a great quarter in capital markets this quarter and it sounds like the expectation there based on your guidance is that that those levels should hold into this quarter so im just trying to understand i guess youre seeing theres a visible pipeline there that would cause you to say that or just trying to reconcile maybe the thought that activity would start to slow pretty meaningfully there so just trying to understand why you still have go ahead gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i think you have to look at fee income in total collyn because the mortgage bank is their pipeline is huge so and they took the big impairment i dont anticipate im not sure whats going to happen with interest rates vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania right fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania i dont want to forecast but i would expect that their fee income in the next quarter would be significantly higher and then you have the sba business outside of the ppp program that had a pretty solid pipeline going into this situation and then theres a lot of activity the first two months of march were pretty darn good from an origination perspective for us across the geographies so i would expect that capital markets activity would continue into next quarter i cant predict at what level but i would expect it to continue because there are a number of companies that would like to fix their debt and there are several deals that we were working through from the syndications perspective so again theres a lot of uncertainty were trying to do the best we can with the forecasting but we were looking pretty good going into this collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania well see what happens as it all shakes out collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah thats great okay thats all i had thanks guys vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you very much vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks very much gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks operator our next question comes from brody preston with stephens inc please go ahead brody preston q analyst stephens inc good morning everyone how are you vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning brody fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania good how are you brody preston q analyst stephens inc yeah good i just wanted to circle back on the ppp income recognition so i just want to better understand why would i guess we pushed out to because just from an accrual accounting perspective you did most of the activity here early in the second quarter and then theres the eightweek period which gets us to sort of the beginning weeks of june and so i would think that you have a sense for at least for round one whats been utilized by june and so what will be forgiven and just so why would you accrue for that in as opposed to gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania well theres a process they still have to put out the guidelines on the forgiveness as to how that process is going to work brody so youre really not going to know with certainty that every single loans will get that forgiveness theyre all guaranteed so from a risk standpoint youre covered there but from a kind of loan accounting standpoint you cant really bring in the unamortized or unaccreted fee until the loan is forgiven and paid off so since you dont know with certainty that all of those are going to be forgiven when they go through that still to be defined sba process thats why and it will accrete some of it in but the full amount really doesnt come in until the loan is truly paid off and then you would bring it in vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania and id say given the size of our client coming through i mean the last batch that we funded was under so i think that theres going to be indiscernible we have more small businesses that weve brought through here our average is way lower than many out there so the timing of when that they prepare the information to get forgiveness indiscernible on the process that we dont have yet is a big question mark so i think for us its going to be maybe a little slower because the customers arent as sophisticated right so it might take them a little longer vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania well plus there is an eightweek period thats baked into that brody right gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah exactly vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 so you first have to wait till after eight weeks and then you have to follow whatever the process is that the sba lays out as far as how its going to work so that gets you through june gets you into third quarter gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah brody preston q analyst stephens inc right okay gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah theyre matching the fee up with the loan on a per loan basis and then kind of baking it into the yield i guess so it will show up vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah no you got it brody preston q analyst stephens inc right okay thats helpful and then just wanted to go back gary you said youve of loans on deferral right now expect to get up to about just given whats in the pipeline so thats about billion you are i guess in the slide deck you are starting with 90day deferrals for these customers but fasb and the regulators have sort of given leeway to get up to days deferral periods do you expect to go there for the bulk of these loans or are you seeing i guess like if you could give some color on the type of borrower thats taking advantage of the deferrals are youre seeing a mix between borrowers that actually need it and maybe some borrowers that are pretty strong and maybe just want some extra liquidity gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania we are seeing that and what i can tell you brody is a significant piece of the a significant percentage of the commercial borrowers which weve offered interestonly payments to essentially deferring the principalonly or a full deferral we are very heavy on the interestonly side of that equation so the borrowers are choosing north of of the time to pay the interest and just defer the principal so i think that speaks to the quality of the borrower and the portfolio thats looking for deferrals here i think they are looking for to preserve cash and deferrals are available so theyre taking advantage of that appropriately as far as the 180day is concerned we will support borrowers that need it for an additional days so we will be working with those borrowers as we go forward i would expect the restaurant industry would be an industry that would need an additional days as potentially that hotel industry as well so primarily i think theyre going to be heavily focused there brody preston q analyst stephens inc fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 okay thats great color and the reason im asking is just im trying to gauge whether or not you would expect to see a significant increase in your accrued interest receivable line item which just based on the fact that of your commercial borrowers are continuing indiscernible im assuming that you dont expect to see your accrued interest receivable to more significantly higher vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania i guess it will be capitalized into the loan too gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania right no we dont brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay yeah i just because i guess im wondering like would some of these borrowers like where youre accruing interest or maybe youre not necessarily receiving it that will get capitalized into the loan balance maybe on the backend but im assuming that that would flow into your accrued interest receivable in the interim correct vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania but not if youre capitalizing it if youre capitalizing it it becomes part of the loan balance brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania essentially funding the payment vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania right yeah gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah youre funding it and then packing it on to the end of the loan vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thats right gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 accruing interest on a higher balance over a period of time vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thats right gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thats whats happening vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania albeit small it is higher gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah smaller but vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania right gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania it is a small piece but its higher yeah brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay and you had you mentioned the the current reserve would be of the dfast in the severe loss scenario so that severe loss sort of is to about million perhaps just doing the math is that a oneyear loss scenario or is that spread out over multiple years in that stress test gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thats over nine quarters the way you do the stress tests so thats cumulative losses over a nine quarter period brody preston q analyst stephens inc so it sounds like just based on that and just given what the ppnr run rate is that you wouldnt even need to dip into the reserve because ppnr would more than cover the losses is that fair to say gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania im not sure im following you brody can you restate that fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 brody preston q analyst stephens inc yeah like your ppnr levels are more than adequate at that level over that time so to cover those losses if you provision for it every quarter where you wouldnt necessarily need to dip into the reserve gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania oh i see what youre saying yeah well it depends on how vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania how it plays gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania how the economy plays out vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania indiscernible gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah brody preston q analyst stephens inc right and then vince you mentioned an interesting stat mobile deposits being up in the last two weeks and i know that the situation is fluid but thats a pretty big number and so i just wanted to better understand has anything happened in the last month or so that changed how youre thinking about indiscernible like are there any geographies where customer behavior has surprised you in terms of mobile adoption during this timeframe or you hadnt previously considered branch cutting and now maybe youre thinking about it vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania well weve cut a lot of branches in fact we cut leading up to this we probably would have left them open had we not already gone down the path what im finding whats interesting is that were still seeing about of the normal volume in the branches from a transaction perspective so what thats telling me is that while people are willing to use remote capture and thats remote capture end to end so that could be small businesses instead of going to the branch using their device in their office its mobile people using their mobile device like i mentioned and we increased the limits to permit more checks to flow through there i would expect and what fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 weve witnessed is a number of customers that may have been older that werent using our online and mobile products are now signing up for it so were walking them through it in the branches so i would expect adoption of those products to be accelerated weve significantly reduced the number of branches i think were getting to the point where the ph dispersion of those branches is good and if we continue to cut at this rate without making some sort of capital investment in the delivery channel it will begin to erode our ability to grow so were looking at that and what i mean by that is were going to have to be strategic about closures we may have to build a new facility and take two out in an area where we can accommodate that consolidation but it requires capex spend thats where we are i think in the evolution of branch closures brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay and then a couple real quick ones indiscernible vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania the other thing i will mention is we also saw a significant uptick in itm transactions obviously so weve about itms the interactive teller machine where you can actually speak to a human being cash a check down to a penny theyve been the utilization on those has increased in the last several weeks again the more comfortable consumers become using these devices and the equipment i think that bodes well for the future in terms of utilization which could lead to more efficiency in the branches from an hr perspective so theres other ways to look at it but its a good question and i appreciate the question thank you brody preston q analyst stephens inc yeah and then one last one for me just with capital im just assuming the buybacks are on hold im sorry if you said that and i missed it vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania the buyback is on hold i think vince mentioned in his prepared comments we acquired about million worth of shares prior to everything imploding and then we put it on hold to preserve capital brody preston q analyst stephens inc all right great thank you very much everyone vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah okay thanks brody gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks brody fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you operator our next question comes from brian martin with janney montgomery please go ahead brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey good morning guys gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey good morning brian vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning brian vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey brian brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey most of my stuff has been covered but maybe i just back to the ppp for just a minute gary or i guess maybe vince and so if you talk about the rate and you talk about the billion just so i understand the what youre talking about as far as when the benefit is realized or how you guys were thinking about it just given theres not a lot of disclosure on it or how youre going to do that if you take and youre talking million and you kind of as you recognize that the next couple quarters or at least kind of what you guys are thinking about can you give any sense for just how that million just on the fee part not the spread part as youre thinking about it today would flow through from a high level perspective how much of the benefit in second and third quarter or in third and fourth quarter gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah it would come in over the two years brian absent stuff once its forgiven then you would bring in whatever is left its accounted for loan by loan so basically the figure you quoted the 60ish which is what the math would work out to be it just gets spread over the twoyear period which is the life of the loans the stated life of the loans i guess i should say and then what we were saying earlier is that the way that process we expect it to work the loans are not going to be forgiven until you get into the third quarter when they will get paid off and then we would bring whatever is left on each loan thats forgiven you would bring that into income during the third quarter brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 okay gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania so i quote it like a kind of allin yields that we would have is what was kind of baked in for the second quarter brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay thats helpful and then just on the i guess as it relates to the balance sheet and capital i mean gary you talked about the loans you sold the assets you sold over the last couple years is there anything i guess you would consider i guess is that something you guys are thinking about now any other asset sales here going forward or is that not really something youre thinking about today gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah were constantly looking at the balance sheet brian and we dont have anything positioned at all that we have any interest in selling at this point that being said were always looking at the mortgage portfolio so if there would be anything it would just be a normal cut type of mortgage pool that would be sold but nothing other than that vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania and it would be a challenge i mean we sold those portfolios during a more robust time brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc right vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania so i think and we were able to get out of those exposures in most cases at a premium and i go back i reflect back on the calls i know we were under tremendous pressure to grow revenue but gary made this strategic decision to exit certain classes asset classes hospitality was a large component of those loans that were sold and they were past credits in many instances so i think weve taken a big bite out of the apple in terms of risk management and if you look back getting out of regency moving away from certain mortgage products that we decided to sell looking at the credit portfolios the acquired portfolios that had a heavy concentration in hospitality and other areas that we didnt have an appetite for we packaged and sold and we sold them at a time when you could get a gain on the sale because there was more certainty at that time brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 credit spreads were narrower gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah the other thing i would add around that brian is our workout team weve really strengthened it over the course of the last two twoandahalf years and they have been doing some tremendous work moving assets off the books that we want off the books and were seeing that continue today so were benefiting from that as well and thats something that is a core focus of the company and well continue to be brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay no thats helpful and that looks like a great move so just a last one for me just on the fee income part just two questions did i hear you right that i know the service charges went down this quarter but you would expect them to go down further and just if you gave any color on just given the market conditions how youre thinking about the wealth and the trust business today if thats also comes under pressure you already saw some of that or are you seeing any of that vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania ill do the last part and then ill go back to the forecast vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania go ahead vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania okay all right yeah i guess what i would say the guidance that we have there is just expecting kind of core noninterest come to be stable from where we were except for the weaker service charges i mean we do expect weve seen some increased waivers not a big number i mean less than million that weve seen in say the first four weeks of this so theres some impact there and then theres just less activity so the comment was that expecting to see weaker service charges on the deposits transaction so that will kind of run against whats happening in the other businesses were still looking for strong contributions when you look at the noninterest income slide that we have in the deck i mean you could see the movement up yearoveryear and versus the fourth quarter in trust insurance securities commissions capital markets was all very strong i mean the percentage growth versus both fourth quarter and first quarter a year ago is up very nicely and weve invested in those businesses weve continued to build out the teams there so i think those contributions have been very important to mitigate the interest rate impacts and then mortgage we would expect to without an msr impact this quarter we would expect that number to kind of come back to a normal normal good solid level in the second quarter vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania but from an earnings perspective if youre speaking about net asset values declining because of the overall market decline i would not expect that to be meaningful or material fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you yeah okay vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania right vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania right so on an earnings perspective id say its not going to be material brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc indiscernible vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay thats all i had guys i appreciate all the color and the details in the release today vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp
