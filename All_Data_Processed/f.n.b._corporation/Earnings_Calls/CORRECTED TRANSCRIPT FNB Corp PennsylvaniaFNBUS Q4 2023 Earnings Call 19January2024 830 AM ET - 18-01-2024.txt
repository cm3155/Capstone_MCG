with our asset quality metrics remaining at solid levels total delinquency finished the year at basis points seasonally up basis points from the end of september and down basis point from the prior yearend period npls and orea decreased basis points from the prior quarter and bps from the yearago period to end at a very good level at bps criticized loans were down basis points compared to both the prior quarter and year end but net chargeoffs for the quarter and fullyear at basis points and basis points respectively ill conclude my remarks with an update on our credit risk management strategies and cre portfolio total provision expense for the quarter stood at million providing for loan growth and chargeoffs additionally provision expense had a positive benefit from a reduction in criticized loans and npls our ending funded reserve increased million in the quarter and stands at million or a solid of loans reflecting our strong position relative to our peers when including acquired unamortized loan discount our reserve stands at and our npl coverage position remains strong at inclusive of the unamortized loan discounts we remain committed to consistent underwriting and credit risk management to maintain a balanced wellpositioned portfolio throughout the economic cycles each quarter we performed specific indepth reviews of our portfolios in addition to ongoing full portfolio stress tests our stress testing results for this quarter have shown lower forecasted net chargeoffs and stable provision compared to the prior quarters results again confirming that our diversified loan portfolio enables us to withstand various economic downturn scenarios regarding the nonowner occupied cre portfolio in we were successful in addressing maturities and the impact of the rising rate environment on the portfolio in we will continue with the same strategy monitoring the rate environment and proactively addressing upcoming maturities at yearend delinquency and npls for the fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2024 nonowner occupied cre portfolio continued to remain very low at basis points and basis points respectively which

and the individual markets in our footprint and well continue to manage risk aggressively while maintaining a consistent credit profile across all of our portfolios i will now turn the call over to vince calabrese our chief financial officer for his remarks vincent j calabrese jr chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks gary and good morning now i will focus on the fourth quarters financial results provide additional detail on the recent actions taken to further optimize our balance sheet and offer guidance for fourth quarter operating net income available to common shareholders totaled million or per share excluding million of significant items impacting earnings on a fullyear basis operating earnings totaled a record per share and tangible book value totaled increase from december part of our ongoing proactive balance sheet management strategy we took several actions to enhance future profitability and capital positioning late in the fourth quarter we sold approximately million of available for sale investment securities transferred million of indirect auto loans to heldforsale and announced the redemption of million of the series e preferred stock that was issued years ago the cumulative impact of these balance sheet actions generates incremental earnings and has the tangible book value earn back period of less than one year versus an earn back of five years for stock buyback while retaining capital flexibility in the sale of investment securities resulted in a realized loss of million in the fourth quarter as we sold securities yielding on average and reinvested the proceeds into securities that yields approximately basis points higher with similar duration and convexity profiles we recorded a million negative fair value mark in other noninterest expense and the indirect auto loans classified as heldforsale at december reflecting changes in interest rates from the time of origination the sale of these loans is expected to close during the first quarter with the proceeds being used to repay borrowings that have a similar yield to the sold loans our yearend loantodeposit ratio benefited by approximately basis points excluding the million of heldforsale indirect auto loans underlying periodend loan growth was since yearend fourth quarter loan production reflected highquality loans across our diverse footprint with quarterly commercial loan growth of million and consumer loan growth of million investment portfolio remained essentially flat linked quarter at billion inclusive of the securities portfolio restructuring there remains a fairly even split between afs and htm with in available for sale at the end of the year the duration of our securities portfolio at december is years similar to last quarter total deposits ended the year at billion a slight increase of million linked quarter as of december noninterestbearing deposits comprised of total deposits compared to at september given our granular stable deposit base we believe we will continue to outperform the industry with a favorable mix of fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2024 noninterestbearing deposits to total deposits and lower deposit costs which meaningfully outperform the peers as our team remains actively focused on managing deposit mix with our spot deposit costs ending the year at our cumulative deposit beta totaled in line with our expectations discussed last quarter fourth quarters net interest margin was a decline of only basis points which is better than our expectations discussed last quarter the yield on earning assets increased basis points to due to higher yields on both loans and investment securities total cost of funds increased basis points to as the cost of interestbearing deposits increased basis points to net interest income totaled million a slight decrease of million from the prior quarter turning to noninterest income and expense operating noninterest income totaled million and adjusting for the million realized loss on the investment securities restructuring mortgage banking operations income increased million linked quarter due to improved gain on sale margins aided by the decline in mortgage rates in the fourth quarter other noninterest income declined million and small business investment company fund income decreased reflecting normal fluctuations based on the performance of the underlying portfolio companies additionally we broke out our service charges fee income line on the income statement into service charges and a new line item for interchange and card transaction fees which was previously captured in the service charge line this will create better transparency into our various revenue streams in noninterest income operating noninterest expense of million was relatively stable compared to the prior quarter when adjusting for the fair value mark on the heldforsale indirect auto loans of million and a million fdic special assessment related to replenishment of the deposit insurance fund for the bank failures the linked quarter increase in outside services of million reflects higher thirdparty costs bank shares and franchise taxes declined million reflecting charitable contributions that qualify for pennsylvania bank shares tax credits and marketing expenses decreased million due to the timing of digital marketing campaigns in the third quarter the fourth quarter efficiency ratio of continues to be in the top quartile of our peers efficiency ratio of on a fullyear basis demonstrates our commitment to effectively managing costs while growing our diverse revenue streams we ended the year with our capital ratios some of the strongest levels in recent history our cet1 ratio of which includes the impact of the previously discussed balance sheet management items and the fdic special assessment remains above our stated operating target tangible common equity totaled and when excluding the 54basispoint impact of aoci would equal tangible book value per common share was at december an increase of per share from september aoci reduced the tangible book value per common share by as of yearend compared to last quarter primarily due to the impact of interest rates on the fair value of available for sale securities because the investment securities that were sold in december were in available for sale the realized loss did not incrementally impact tce or tangible book value since the market value is already reflected in aoci lets now look at the guidance for both the first quarter and the fullyear starting with the balance sheet on a fullyear spot basis we expect loans to grow midsingle digits as we continue to increase our market share across our diverse geographic footprint total projected deposit balances are expected to grow lowsingle digits on a yearoveryear spot basis full year net interest income is expected to be between billion and fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2024 billion with the first quarter of between million and million our guidance assumes basis point rate cuts aligning with the fed stoploss which we are projecting to occur in may july and november noninterest income is expected to continue to benefit from our diversified feebased income strategy the full year results between million and million and the first quarter between million and million full year guidance for noninterest expense is expected to be between million and million which includes the impact of approximately million of rent expense during the build out phase of our new headquarters while we still occupy our current office space adjusting for this impact the midpoint of our expense guidance results in a increase from operating expense levels the first quarter noninterest expense is expected to be between million and million as the compensation expense is higher in the first quarter largely due to normal seasonal longterm stock compensation and higher payroll taxes at the start of the new year full year provision guidance is million to million and is dependent on net loan growth and chargeoff activity lastly the fullyear effective tax rate should be between and which does not assume any investment tax credit activity that may occur with that i will turn the call back to vince vincent j delie jr chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania during fnb completed a number of initiatives that align with our strategic priorities including introducing the estore common application for consumer loan and deposit products expanding our physical delivery channel and investing in systems and processes that enable us to streamline operation we continue to expand our data analytics capability and the use of ai to improve performance these strategic initiatives have directly contributed to our peer relative outperformance in amidst the banking industry disruption with the company generating record operating eps of and strong organic loan growth of billion deposit balances remain flat with noninterestbearing deposits comprising of total deposits and a top quartile cost of funds weve completed over million in costs savings over the last five years excluding acquisition synergies leading to positive operating leverage and efficiency and an efficiency ratio in the top quartile relative to peers at operating return on average tangible common equity totaled and tangible book value grew to a record our asset quality continues to be a strength as we ended the year at or near historically low levels this years exceptional performance was made possible by our employees their commitment to fnbs mission and values drive success for all of our stakeholders in our teams efforts were evident as fnb received more than prestigious awards multiple independent organizations recognized fnbs financial performance outstanding culture and innovative technology with estore earning international we believe that these honors and our outperformance are a direct result of our engaging and rewarding workplace environment i am proud of what weve built together thank you fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2024 question and answer section operator ladies and gentlemen well now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions and our first question today comes from daniel tamayo from raymond james please go ahead with your question daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning guys maybe we start on the impact of the balance sheet restructuring on the margin i appreciate the guidance for but just as we think about the impact on in the first quarter curious if you can walk through how youre thinking about the impact of the restructuring looking at it as a basis point or basis point impact relative to kind of just continued deposit pressure and then how that the path of the margin as it moves throughout the year in your assumptions vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would say a couple of things first of all if we look at the fourth quarter and then i guess will go forward net interest income only declined million linkedquarter which was the same as the prior quarter the nim compression for the quarter was only basis points last quarter was basis points in fact november and december were at basis points so the level kind of stabilized there at least for those two months the restructuring is fully baked into our guidance that we provided i think as far as the past with the margin here i would still say what we said last quarter that probably bottomed somewhere in the first half of the year and then kind of some slight improvement from there as far you get into the second half of the year but theres a lot to happen right with the fed cuts i mean we have three fed cuts in ours and theres three four or five the three felt most reasonable to us thats whats baked into our guidance you know with the benefit of the restructuring and as we have over time well continue to actively go after the brand deposits its been a focus here i think our percentage of total deposits has performed very well relative to peers the changes in that bucket have also kind of stacked up very well so the nii guide kind of has everything baked into it danny daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc no i understand and i appreciate that i guess another way of asking maybe do you think the deposit pressure in the first quarter offset the i mean it sounds like youre saying we still maybe get more compression in the first quarter on an overall basis do you think that offsets more than offsets the balance sheet restructuring and that that just continues in the first half or in the first quarter vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania well were not going to guide to were not going to specifically comment on margin for the quarter right you know the net interest income has all of that baked in and the mix shift that has happened during the quarter weve continued to see customers going after higher rate products and thats just natural people whore sitting here feeling like okay that is at the top average rate since july when are they going to start to cut so its definitely been some of that mix shift still occurring in the first quarter our demand deposits thats usually our weakest quarter seasonally because of municipal deposits that kind of bottom and then build up so all of that fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2024 does put some pressure on the margin and then the restructuring helps offset some of those impacts in the first quarter probably one way that i could comment on that daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc got it okay i guess just lastly to just dig in on the balance sheet sensitivity side just curious how we should be thinking about you mentioned bottoming in the middle of the year i think in the past weve talked about maybe being liability sensitive in the medium term but maybe asset sensitive in the near term with rate cuts thats still how we should be thinking about it perhaps some negative impact early on and then maybe after a few quarters thats when you start to benefit more from rate cuts vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah so thats definitely the right way to think about it you know that the sensitivity whether we get additional cuts beyond the three as you know theres a lot of moving parts to this question and theres actions we may take depending on the economic environment so but as you described the timeframe is key right in the short run you have a negative impact particularly from the cuts sort of additional cuts and then i think the deposit lags will catch up over time i mean historically if you look at our beta today right were around in the last upgrade cycle its kind of maxed out at it seems reasonable to assume that but that would change kind of more in the medium term longer term with cash back up probably of the medium term with deposit rate lags that we catch up and have that benefit and as you know weve taken a lot of actions i mean the cd book has been growing in the shorter term month and 13month type area our total average maturity of the cd portfolio right now is months so theres opportunity there to reprice that as we go forward thank god for the timing of when the fed would move but yeah i think thats were still slightly asset sensitive and really philosophically managing to neutral and then we think that if you look at our margin past for the year its kind of more neutral with the expected three cuts that we have baked in daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc okay great thank you for all the color appreciate it vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania sure operator our next question comes from frank schiraldi from piper sandler please go ahead with your question frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co good morning just wondered if you could talk a little bit vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2024 frank frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co about the dynamics of loan growth versus deposit growth yearonyear obviously your guide has you getting closer to loan to deposit over time just trying to think through what might be the main governor on loan growth here and how youre bringing deposit dollars in the door in what continues to be a pretty competitive environment vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i think let me start out and then i can turn it over to vince calabrese first of all i think some of the things that we talked about in the prepared comments relative to acquiring new clients is a way for us to drive deposit balances i mean adding the ability to simultaneously open a deposit account with a loan application without additional keystrokes thats huge for us so i think thatll help once the field starts utilizing these tools and customers start engaging online and realize that they can do that itll increase our probability of capturing more of the client relationship particularly the deposit side so when the loan request comes in well be able to act a little more quickly on opening the deposit account so thats one thing that we plan for and we think will help us as we move forward if you look at engagement with the estore we looked at we rolled that out about midyear so if you look at the six months in versus the six months in in the same period and you compare the number of applications that we were able to obtain online theyve doubled so we doubled the number of consumer loan applications thats without the deposit account opening capability by the way and of those clients of those applications were with nonfnb customers so thats one piece of it the enhancements to the digital strategy the second opportunity for us is really in small business and middle market banking on the tm side weve invested pretty heavily in our treasury management capabilities we have some product capabilities coming online we mentioned that were going to bundle products in the small business space in probably towards the latter half of the year well be rolling that out that will also us grow deposit balances and if you look at what weve done historically weve historically grown deposit balances around the to range organically so i think weve kept pace with the organic loan growth that weve achieved which is similar right over a long period of time and i think some of the things that weve done strategically and entering into new markets that have more opportunities because of population growth and business formation were going to be able to continue to achieve our objective which is to fund our loan growth with the deposit balances that we see from new customers i dont know vince do you want to add anything numerically vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah no all i would add frank is that we dont get all the way to a within our guidance you know were in that kind of area as you kind of forecast it out but as weve done in the past historically when we got to going back a bunch of years we took action we took action this quarter selling the indirect auto loans creates more shelf space for us i mean it was a in the loan to deposit ratio so we will manage that level we wont go all the way to were in the mid which is whats baked into the guidance as i mentioned well start to manage we get to well look at whats the environment how fast are loans growing and well take action as we always have just to kind of manage that fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2024 vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania you know for us its not a function its not a question as to whether or not we can fund our balance sheet with deposit growth we can do that and we have the capability of doing it it would just be a margin forever right so were trying to balance it all out frank frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co got it vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania and we are very confident that we can grow for the price of we want to compete with everybody else to up their prices up for our cds and our money market rates we could bring a lot of money in vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania we brought in billion in new money vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i mean we vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania in the back half of the year vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania its a function of trying to manage it all so that we maintain relative profitability our goal is to outperform so were not trying to give everything away or balloon our balance sheet we are we understand what our funding constraints could potentially be and the tradeoff is margin so we have to be getting it on the other side with the loan originations to justify it thats how we look at it frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co sure oh no understood understood thats great color thanks and then i guess just a followup there vince you mentioned the making some room with the smaller sale of the loans obviously youre always thinking about balance sheet optimization but that being said i just wonder if this is if you see more opportunities here in the near term to do just that maybe jettison some smaller pieces that for whatever reason the total returns are not there is that a way in the near term to continue to hold the loan to deposit ratio where it is or is or do you see this as more of like a one and done in the near term vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2024 yeah no id say we spent a lot of time during the fourth quarter sizing what we wanted to do as far as the amount of security and the amount of the loans that we sell so we dont have any plans to do any additional sales as were sitting here today i think indiscernible we have the ability to fund and grow the deposits weve done it forever so at this point i wouldnt say one and done forever right because were always studying the balance sheet and if theres opportunities well look at it but theres no plans right now that like i said we spent a lot of time sizing it and came up with what we executed on vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania if the rate environment enables us to unload lowyielding assets and you know we get a gain and we can roll that into something else sure weve done that historically weve sold over a billion over the years so well look selectively frank and we constantly look at the balance sheet our objective is to produce the highest returns possible and well look at opportunities to get out particularly with indirect auto the limited relationship right i mean well look at that and well trade out of it or we pair that right weve used pricing mechanisms to move some of the portfolio around right and well see its all a function of what the interest rate environment is what demand looks like in higher yielding categories what the risk profile of the balance sheet looks like we take all of that into consideration and make decisions based on that but our plan is to manage in the range from a loan to deposit perspective that we have historically were not looking to move outside of that vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would just say too frank were not we dont feel constrained as far as loan growth that we would want to go after i mean the midtohigh single digits that weve done we can do that weve done things like vince was describing and then like in the mortgage business weve adjusted our pricing a little bit there to make a more salable product so were kind of reducing the amount of growth thats going on to the balance sheet which is kind of part of how we manage the balance sheet so theres a lot of different levers there frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co great okay and thanks for the color vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania all right thank you operator our next question comes from timur braziler from wells fargo please go ahead with your question timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning and maybe starting fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2024 vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania hi timur timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc vince to lead you had made a comment positive operating leverage in you look to be in the top quartile in operating leverage going forward does that put positive operating leverage on the table for or is the revenue backdrop challenging enough or thats more likely not going to happen next year vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i think as we move through this interest rate cycle it becomes more challenging obviously right because youre seeing decline in revenue and your expense base is pretty much fixed so you take that expense out its hard to fix income i think the second half of the year i certainly would expect us to go produce positive operating leverage so as we move through that inflection point that vince spoke about earlier like the margin compression with the rate cuts we should be able to move through that and into the second half of the year to experience positive operating leverage if you look at fnb on a fullyear basis in we outperformed others right because we produced fullyear operating leverage there was negative operating leverage all over the place at least based on what i saw so i think i would expect us to do everything we can to be in a similar position in hope that helps timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thats helpful yeah thats helpful thank you and then one for gary just looking at the office maturities in it looks like of that book is maturing im just wondering how much of that maturation is for loans kind of vintage and earlier and then as you look at your cre portfolio again looking at the vintages and earlier how different are those loans from a credit quality standpoint just given how different the world is today versus prepandemic gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah generally speaking no were going to underwrite those things from the origination date in the low to high range so when you look at those maturities in addition to that ltv level which has been very helpful through this cycle so far theyre also underwritten very short so with maturities inside of five years or slightly less in some cases so a number of those or a number of those transactions have been renewed over the last year or two many of those borrowers rightsized those transactions it has been our intent to keep those maturities very short and well continue to do that during these times that all said were still as focused as we are on that office space as is everyone we feel quite good about the portfolio at this point weve only had a couple of credits over the last number of years when since this space has taken a tough go of it from all of the pandemic issues that weve seen and weve only had a couple of credits that weve had to deal with from a loss standpoint fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2024 so we feel good about the position of it there is a roll rate in the coming year and we expect to move through that with our sponsors which have shown the ability to rightsize post additional interest reserves to pay down debt and bring it back to a basis points type of debt service coverage so well continue to do the same thing in that we did in then vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah so ill add on to what gary said i think from a prudent underwriting perspective most of the transactions that we would have underwritten in would have had longterm leases that go out longer than the maturity date gary mentioned having a shorter maturity date what that means is that while cap rates may change and the valuation may change with a lower ltv and a longer lease term that the debt service coverage remains intact so its a lot easier to deal with a devaluation because of a rise in cap rate if you have substantial liquidity and a longterm tenant locked up so i think that in almost every case thats what we would look at when we would underwrite these transactions which gives us a great degree of confidence i also can tell you that most of the portfolio the vast majority of the portfolio sits outside of the urban office scenario so i think that we have quite a bit of protection in that suburban office and higher growth areas is not as subject to vacancy like you see in the large cities gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania the other vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania that we can add sort of the size of the granularity gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania of the portfolio is less than million in terms of loan size you move that up to million to million its another million and so youre pushing of the portfolio is less than almost is less than million and if you move that up one more level to million and youre at of the book of business and in total the top credits averaged right at just a touch above million i think its right at million so the portfolio is very granular i think weve been very prudent in taking granular hold positions across that space and its really shown in the performance through whats been a difficult time vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania its geographically diverse too as the other program spread across seven states but concentrated on one city and one specific area so that we obviously its something we watch as you know theres definitely weakness in urban office so its a good question does that help timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2024 vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania are we good timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc thats helpful yes i appreciate the color thank you operator our next question comes from casey haire from jefferies please go ahead with your question casey haire q analyst jefferies llc great thanks good morning guys vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning casey haire q analyst jefferies llc i wanted to followup on the nii guide so vince see if it sounds like deposit beta is going to peak at around cum deposit beta peaks around just wondering when does that take place relative to your first fed cut and then what does your guide assume for deposit beta on the way down for vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would say we would drift a little higher we ended the year at i think it says in the slide well drift a little bit higher here another point or points its what were thinking and then when that happens for the second quarter kind of consistent with the margin kind of bottoming in the first half of the year and then what we were thinking i mentioned the ill say its been now twice on the upside i think we as we look to the point when the fed pivots and starts to reduce rates using a similar over the medium term right makes sense to us but within depending on the timing of the fed cuts right i mean we get some portion of that probably get more than half of it but you wouldnt get all in calendar so as we have been were actively managing our deposit book on the pricing and in our weekly pricing committee meetings were already start to talk about when do we lower rates some of our competitors have so were going to monitor very closely discuss it constantly and well take the right action at the right time but somewhere in that second half or so that might get this year casey haire q analyst jefferies llc got you thank you and then vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2024 thats indiscernible just logical casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah no understood understood and then just switching to credit gary if im here if im interpreting your remarks correctly it sounds like you expect net chargeoffs to go to decline this year im just wondering what kind of loss rate your provision guide contemplates gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i mean in terms of the provision guide the to naturally that supports loan growth as well as chargeoffs the specific chargeoff level that weve got baked into our plans i mean thats some thats a number we dont disclose but i would concur with your thoughts i mean we do expect performance to be stable to slightly improve as indiscernible vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania but i think casey if you go to page in our presentation you can see net chargeoffs to average loans you know the third quarter of has we have that onetime event that occurs so i mean were casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah fair enough thats that was a yeah great vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thats what youre seeing in your chargeoffs gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah if you look over the last three years casey the last three years would have been basis points and would have been basis points excluding that one item so youve got really solid steady performance there over a very pretty sizable extended and somewhat tumultuous period and like i said we like the position of the portfolio we feel quite good about it going into naturally were all concerned a bit about where is this economy going and what will that all mean and that has to play out as we all know but were seeing good steady performance and stable outcomes across the portfolios casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay great and just last one for me vince delie you mentioned your tce is at the highest level i think in your history and the cet1 above how are you guys thinking about whats the share buyback appetite with your capital ratios at current levels vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2024 and we still have we have authorization to repurchase shares from the board we plan on evaluating that as we move along if we see opportunities to buy shares back were certainly going to do it if the earn back is reasonable right i mean we just were going to manage tangible book value levels as well so i think were going to continue to look at it and evaluate it and opportunistically execute transactions if they make sense the deployment of capital as we move forward really were looking at the potential for changes in the economy and loan growth as well because we want to we want to deploy that capital in the most meaningful way but if we see slowness were not just going to sit here and continue to build capital indiscernible we have to do to make sure the returns are indiscernible i dont know if that answers your question or not casey haire q analyst jefferies llc thank you vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania that in other words still on the table and were still going to consider it as we move along casey haire q analyst jefferies llc got you thanks guys operator our next question comes from michael perito from kbw please go ahead with your question michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey guys good morning thanks for all the color so far i really just have one last question i wanted to hit on for gary on the credit piece just yesterday discover reported earnings and had some uptick on the consumer side in their prime book lines of credit autos and things of that nature just curious what you guys are seeing on the consumer side and from a credit health perspective most of those portfolios outside the mortgage book i think shrunk this year just what type of growth is baked into to and what are some of the maybe the key things that could drive some better growth performance on the consumer side is it just kind of a macro health environment is it pricing competitive dynamics just would love some color around all those topics that would be great thanks gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah total delinquency across that allinclusive portfolio which is right at about billion is basis points so thats thats allin consumer the fourth quarter is always up a little bit seasonally at the end of the year with the holidays and whatnot but if you look over a rolling 13month timeframe its been from basis points to the low so weve seen very consistent performance across that portfolio the underwriting that we do there i feel very good about i think its very very prudent and very stable were able to generate good loan growth through those portfolios and when you when you look at the investment that weve made and the teams there its an important part of our business so as we look forward we continue to expect good solid growth there in that business at slightly higher range in this environment with higher singledigit range in this environment and expect that portfolio continue to perform well through the cycle that were indiscernible fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2024 michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thats helpful so it sounds like in the midsingle digit growth guidance theres some consumer growth baked into that for thats the expectation as you stand today gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yes and mortgage vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah including mortgage but if you stripped out more were still expecting growth and again i think some of the investments weve made in the digital tools the fact that were spread across a pretty wide geography thats million consumers in our footprint some of the build out with the atm delivery channel that heightens provides consumers with accessibility to cash and our brand i think all of that gives us a little bit of confidence even though i would say the consumer with inflation and some of the changes economically that are going on are going to be a little challenged i think were in a pretty good spot to continue to grow the book not as robustly as we have in the past i know its been last year it was tough but things are going to stabilize and we should see in a lower rate environment some opportunities to grow that portfolio but thats baked into the guide michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great very helpful and thank you guys and for all the other color this morning appreciate it gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania okay thank you vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you take care operator our next question comes from russell gunther from stephens please go ahead with your question russell e t gunther q analyst stephens inc hey good morning guys and i just wanted to followup on the balance sheet repositioning and around the tangible book value earn back math so i get the securities repositioning i just wanted to confirm that the preferred stock dividend saving is included in that calculation and then just asked for some additional color on the indirect auto piece what rate borrowings would be paid down whether theres any reserve release associated with those loans included in that math just trying to get the puts and takes vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2024 yeah so russell so as you know the securities repositioning was done on the available for sale portfolio so that was only already baked into the tangible book values theres no incremental hit from that theres very slight hit from the loan sale but just given the overall strong earnings accretion from the combined transaction that earn back is less than a year when you add in the preferred dividend it still stays obviously because thats accretive to that would be less than a year so pretty strong earn back metrics anything sorry did i address all your questions there russell e t gunther q analyst stephens inc the auto piece and what the just kind of puts and takes in the savings were there just the rate of borrowings youd expect to pay down and whether theres any reserve release associated with those loans thats included in that calculation vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania got you yeah no so the borrowings we talked about paying off at a similar rate as the yield on the loans so were talking roughly to type yield on those loans so vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania net yeah vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania net so pay down borrowings at a similar rate and just as a reminder that loan sale hasnt closed yet so we actually havent seen the capital benefits from that whole transaction so just on a pro forma basis when the loans do go off the balance sheet wed expect to see if you want increase on an estimated basis points npv to increase roughly basis points as well on top of that russell e t gunther q analyst stephens inc okay okay great vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania and then theres no interest theres no additional income statement impact russell in the first quarter because with us marking it to the market that captures everything in the fourth quarter so really its just actually executing the sale itself russell e t gunther q analyst stephens inc thank you guys and then i guess just the last followup then would be back to the cet1 discussion pro forma still north of that you guys addressed your repurchases but also sensitivity around earn back so not willing to let capital indiscernible are additional securities repositionings on the table or how are you thinking about that fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2024 vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania no i think we spent a lot of time in the fourth quarter sizing what we did so we dont have any plans to do any additional securities so we sit here remember during the last few years i mean we stayed short from our investment portfolio we stayed conservative and how we manage that so the total dollar amount that we did there was kind of the total were looking to do we dont have indiscernible and then from a capital ratio perspective within our guidance i mean our capital ratios will drift up as you go through the year which is important and then to vinces point earlier opportunistically that will create an ability to do share buybacks if it make sense vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah and i like to see tangible book value above right i mean that would be something that we could all celebrate because i think ultimately that translates into a higher valuation for us given our profitability but so were going to be managing all of that were going to be watching all of that and making smart decision based upon return pressures russell e t gunther q analyst stephens inc understood thank you guys i appreciate you all taking my question vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks russell vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you operator thank you our next question comes from manuel navas from da davidson company please go ahead with your question manuel navas q analyst da davidson co hey good morning i just wanted to get a bit of your economic backdrop behind your loan growth guidance and then behind the provisioning guidance vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania i mean economic environment i mean is kind of what the consensus economists would be saying i mean its slowing growth in the second half of the year were not making kind of calls on our own were kind of looking at fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2024 what the expectations are from the economists throughout the country and thats kind of whats baked in and all the gdps guiding our plan goes down to like a zero point but its still growth vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania still point on average vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania on average for the year right manuel navas q analyst da davidson co okay so if the expectations vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania indiscernible im sorry go ahead manuel navas q analyst da davidson co so to add expectation if it was to worsen would the provision be above the range vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania well i think were very comfortable with the range we have gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania right yeah and we feel very comfortable with the range at this point on the economy where the economy is today and how the portfolio is positioned manuel navas q analyst da davidson co and then loan growth the pace has been really strong here to close the year and is that kind of more frontend loaded as it kind of slows across the back half of the year or is it you feel pretty good about that midsingle digits kind of staying consistent across the year vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania no i think yeah i mean theres seasonality within the originations depending on the portfolio if you look at the commercial book it tends it tends to grow more in the second into the third quarter if you look at mortgage banking i mean move that up a little bit maybe a quarter really a first and second quarter it starts to take off so there are differences in the portfolios i just use those two as an example but i think when we build our plan to give consensus we look at both macro and micro scenarios so basically we built our plan from the ground up fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2024 we survey our business units we look at our production capability historically in the markets were in and then we look at the macroeconomic environment say is this achievable and whats happening and we basically use thats why vince said we use consensus estimates by economists we dont forecast ourselves we use somebody elses forecast and then we apply that to our model so its all kind of baked into to what we give you so were building it from inside of our own company and then were looking at the macroeconomic factors if it influence that that goes for provision expense loan growth commercial consumer mortgage kind of break it down by segment and then build it from the ground up and so i think given where we are in the cycle and what were seeing hard to predict but were a little more optimistic than we were a quarter ago going into next year and i think thats reflected in the guide on the loan growth im hoping we can do better if you look at our pipelines we did pretty well commercially in the last quarter its reflected in the loan growth and it surged in the fourth quarter that can change from year to year commercially but we did well last quarter so when you look at our pipelines moving forward were relatively flat so you dont have this big pipeline that were looking at that says hey yeah were going to achieve or or or whatever the midsingle digit in that portfolio close to so i would say that i feel pretty confident about what were putting forward given what we know about the economy today i dont know if that helps manuel navas q analyst da davidson co thats great no no thats really helpful vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania and that gives you confidence manuel navas q analyst da davidson co no thats great can i add is there any kind of regional takeaways from your estore performance you have a lot of activity you have lot of nonaccount holders using the estore can you break it down regionally at all or is it just great trends in general vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah thats an interesting question i had just asked our people that question so i ask the same question internally its still relatively new were trying to figure out how to devise reporting that get us as granular as we need to be from an origination perspective when they initially looked at it its pretty much across the board which is interesting it wasnt in one particular geography it was spread across pretty broad geographies so i think anywhere where we have name recognition branch location right we tend to get more action once you move outside of that we dont advertise a lot so you dont see as much activity fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2024 so which is part of the reason why we decided to go with branded atms and do the atm deployment because our theory was that the more frequently consumers see us the more likely they are to engage us digitally that was part of the strategy so it seems to be working if you look at where our geographic locations are where we have signage and some recognition theres more activity digital manuel navas q analyst da davidson co thats great i appreciate that thank you guys vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania and then obviously were going to get now that weve added the deposit products in december we are going to start advertising so we will try to grow that through some advertising bring some awareness to the consumer up the capability i know locally i saw during the super bowl we managed to pull that not for super bowl but the national championship for the college football indiscernible steelers were already out so im lost but we did some we did some sport lets put it this way we were in the playoff game we ran during the steelersbuffalo bills game we ran during the national championship probably locally right because we have customers that are in tune with those events so we ran some advertising and some people commented on it and then the branding of the buildings in certain markets has helped us with visibility particularly for i think weve seen more activity from a prospect prospecting perspective because of the signage on our headquarters building and that activity has brought some people in and then the sponsorships with the penguins the away jersey the patch youve got a lot of play on that as well but anyway thats how were trying to build awareness manuel navas q analyst da davidson co thats great thank you appreciate it vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania if thats helpful operator operator instructions vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania all right thank you operator operator instructions our next question comes from brian martin from janney please go ahead with your question brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott hey good morning guys look most of my fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2024 vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning brian brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott most of my questions have been answered just one question vince you answered it i think the last question was just on the cadence of the commercial growth of the commercial pipeline it sounds like its a little bit slower to start here given what fourth quarter look like but pipe builds from there thats just in general what i heard is that fair vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah yeah we i mean we had a really strong third quarter that kind of cleared out the 90day bucket on the pipeline and that has to rebuild so its relatively flat we had good production out of the carolinas theres doubledigit growth in some of the carolina portfolios that is pretty positive without cre without a big contribution from cre so were pretty excited about that and i think therell be opportunity in the midwest and in the northeast as well from a ci perspective as we move into next year the latter half of next year brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott got you okay and then just one for gary gary the credit is it sounds very strong i mean i guess if you point to one area today that youre maybe a bit more watchful of and especially to criticize it sounds like they were down this quarter but just in general is there any area that youre paying a bit more attention to as you kind of head into given the strength of the portfolio gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania well i think the cre book just in general i mean weve been all over that and the team has done a really nice job of building out risk management practices around that tom fisher and his team are all over those books of business as they are the rest of the portfolio but the office space naturally weve said it for years that was going to be a longer term portfolio segment in the industry that is going have to be dealt with over time i mean that change was i would say not temporary theres been a permanent change in that market fortunately i think weve chosen well there over time with solid sponsors that have liquidity and i think thats why that portfolio has continued to perform as it has to this point but you know that cre space in that office portfolio i think it has a way to go yet brian so well continue to be all over that brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott okay perfect and then gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania as we move forward in fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2024 brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott yeah and then maybe just last two just on the fee income side just kind of looking at the pickup in mortgage and you talked a little bit about it kind of a little bit of a change in your strategy there just kind of the puts and takes on mortgage outlook for here and then just the capital markets revenue its pretty consistent maybe a little bit lower level from where it was previous years just kind of wondering how to think about that or just how the pipeline looks there vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would just say the noninterest income again shows the benefit of having converged high revenue base right and weve had another good quarter above weve been above six out of the last seven quarters getting there different ways but again the benefit of diversification so capital markets was a solid quarter for us i mean its up from the prior quarter its down from last year when it had a indiscernible but theres still a lot of opportunity there and i think when the rate environment starts to shift there will continue to be opportunity there but we had really solid contributions from all the components there from the swap perspective international syndication to capital markets so theres a lot of fixes even within that business and then the mortgage bounced back i mean we had a really strong i mean in an environment where the market was down from an origination standpoint the overall industry was down we were up and were forecasting for from an origination standpoint we have close to doubledigit increase in originations in versus and then my comments on pricing was more just about salable versus portfolio not really affecting the level of originations but kind of what we bring on the balance sheet and what we sell vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah the other thing i would say is were in a lower rate environment if we do get the rate decreases we should see more activity and derivatives more activity in debt capital markets with our large corporate customers going to market to raise capital and syndication should pick up in the second half of the year or so and then the mortgage business gain on sale should accelerate so like vince said having a portfolio and then weve had good steady growth i should mention that our asset management and the wealth and trust shops have done extraordinarily well so theyre up in revenue and net income theyve grown net assets under vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania record levels too vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania i mean were at record levels so were in good markets where we should see continued growth in that book so we have a good balanced set of fee generators that i think in the coming year if rates play out the way some are forecasting we should do okay with noninterest income vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2024 and then initiatives on the small business in tm side will be additive brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott yeah no the businesses you guys have built out are really paying dividends here and like you said the diversification and i guess on the mortgage i was just trying to understand vince if part of the increase this quarter was really just you selling more and if so if you do have an increase in originations next year and you continue to sell at a higher rate maybe that also contributes to a better outlook for vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah the gain on sale margin is lower though you know like brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott yeah vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania it depends on the rate environment but when you look at it we may have sold but were not making as much per unit were just moving it off the balance sheet because the rate environments provide us with the opportunity to do that so and were remember we focused principally on purchase money so that activity has been lower right i mean we dont were not in a declining rate environment we would see more refinance activity even though we focus more on purchase money we would get some benefit from the refinance market so if theres tradeoffs but i think its a pretty balanced approach and i think thats i think weve been able to sustain our fee income levels through this period even with declining consumer fee income right we done pretty good on it vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania and brian i would just add the mortgage income in the fourth quarter had benefit from rates coming down to the fair value mark on the pipeline is contributed to that in the fourth quarter brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott got you okay perfect and then just the last one for me its just on the margin vince expenses just the one question just remind me i mean from a variable rate perspective i mean the percentage of variable rate loans and the if a basis point cut on that piece how much has that moved the margin for each kind of basis point cut vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania you need to look at the whole balance sheet right brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott yeah fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2024 vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania i think our percentage is still what for our loans that are very indiscernible adjusted down and that was talked about earlier and you have all the different moving parts the cds are tenmonth average maturity so brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott okay vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania theres pluses and minuses there thats kind of all baked into the margins kind of bottoming in the first half of the year brian and then move up vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott yeah okay that helps out its so all right i appreciate it thanks for taking the questions guys operator and ladies and gentlemen at this time vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania all right thanks brian vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you operator im showing no additional questions id like to turn the floor back over to vince delie for any closing remarks vincent j delie jr chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah id like to thank everybody for the questions great questions thank you for your interest and i think given whats gone on this year fnb has performed very well and many of the key strategies that weve deployed that weve talked about over the years really played out during the liquidity crisis earlier this year you got to see firsthand what weve been talking about in terms of client primacy the quality of our deposit portfolio and our credit underwriting so i think its it really showed itself this year and im very excited about moving into next year hopefully moving into a better economic environment as we move into particularly in the latter half of fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2024 and i again would like to thank our employees because they step up and get things done and did an admirable job
