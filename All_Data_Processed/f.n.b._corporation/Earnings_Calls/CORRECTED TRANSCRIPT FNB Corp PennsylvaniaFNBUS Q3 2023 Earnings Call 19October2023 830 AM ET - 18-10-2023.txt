points to end at a solid bps criticized loans were down basis points with net chargeoffs for the quarter and yeartodate of and basis points respectively excluding the isolated credit that vince noted net chargeoffs for the quarter and yeartodate period were and basis points respectively ill conclude my remarks with an update on our credit risk management strategies and cre portfolio as previously disclosed in the second quarter earnings call we placed a single million ci loan on non accrual based on alleged fraud and upon later findings uncovered during our ongoing investigation including subsequent bankruptcy filings by our borrower and its primary supplier the outstanding balance was charged off we will continue to monitor the bankruptcy process closely and aggressively pursue all opportunities to recover a portion of the chargeoff total provision expense for the quarter stood at million providing for loan growth and the previously mentioned chargeoff in excess of the million specific reserve that we allocated to it at the prior quarter end our ending funded reserve decreased million in the quarter and stands at million or a solid of loans reflecting our strong position relative to our peers when including acquired unamortized loan discounts our reserve stands at and our npl coverage position remains strong at inclusive of the unamortized loan discounts we remain

call 19oct2023 vincent j calabrese jr chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks gary and good morning today i will focus on the third quarters financial results and offer guidance updates for the fourth quarter third quarter net income available to common shareholders totaled million or per share bringing yeartodate earnings per share to the results include contributions from our commercial leasing team who originate renewable energy financing transactions as part of their business model and this quarter they closed a large solar deal with a related investment tax credit loans and leases ended the quarter at billion growing million or linked quarter driven by the success of our strategy to grow high quality loans across our diverse footprint commercial loan growth of million or was across our seven state geography with notable contributions in the pittsburgh midatlantic and north carolina markets consumer loans ended the third quarter at billion a linked quarter increase of million or led by growth in residential mortgages investment portfolio remained flat at billion with a fairly even split between afs and htm the duration of our securities portfolio at september is years similar to last quarter total deposits ended september at billion with a healthy increase of million linked quarter or reflecting organic deposit growth and seasonal municipal deposit inflows our deposit gathering capabilities have continued to outperform the industry as illustrated by the federal reserve h8 deposit data where our deposit growth was nearly basis points higher for the quarter and basis points higher since year end the deposit mix shift slowed modestly this quarter as customers moved into time deposits and interestbearing demand deposits which grew million and million respectively more than offsetting the decrease in noninterestbearing deposits of million as time deposits have grown we have intentionally kept the portfolio short with a weighted average maturity of months so then when rates do fall we will have the ability to reprice these balances downwards as of september noninterestbearing deposits comprised of total deposits compared to at june and at year end given our granular stable deposit base we believe we will continue to outperform the industry with a favorable mix of noninterestbearing deposits to total deposits even in a higher for longer interest rate environment the loans to deposit ratio remained at a comfortable level of flat with june revenue totaled million driven by net interest income of million and growth in noninterest income reflecting our diversified fee income strategy the third quarters net interest margin was a decline of basis points moderating from the basis point decline last quarter the yield on earning assets increased basis points to reflecting higher yields on loans and investment securities total cost of funds increased basis points to as the cost of interestbearing deposits increased basis points to and was partially offset by the contribution from noninterestbearing deposits we continue to actively manage our total deposit cost and ended the quarter at bringing the cumulative deposit beta to we are projecting cumulative beta to end in the mid turning to noninterest income and expense noninterest income totaled million a increase from the second quarter as capital markets income increased million led by international banking with solid contributions from swap fees syndications and debt capital markets income mortgage banking operations fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 income decreased million due to negative fair value marks given the sharp increase in mortgage rates during the third quarter that more than offset a increase in total salable mortgage production versus last quarter noninterest expense totaled million an increase of million or from last quarter net occupancy and equipment expense increased million largely due to the impact of technology investments and the inflationary macroeconomic environment marketing expenses increased million due to the timing of digital marketing campaigns which helped drive deposit growth and acquire additional households the efficiency ratio equaled a solid up slightly from last quarter for the first nine months of the efficiency ratio totaled compared to for the same timeframe in while supporting the strong loan growth our capital ratios remained robust through the quarter our tce finished the quarter at and when adjusted for held to maturity investment marks would equal our cet1 ratio at is in line with peer median and we remain wellcapitalized even when including the fair value marks in our afs and htm portfolios tangible book value per common share was at september an increase of per share from june largely from the higher level of retained earnings more than offsetting the increased impact of aoci which reduced the current quarter end tangible book value per common share by on a yearoveryear basis tangible book value per common share increased a full dollar or demonstrating our commitment to internal capital generation lets now look at the fourth quarter financial objectives starting with the balance sheet on a full year spot basis we increased our previous guide for loans to grow midtohigh single digits yearoveryear as we take this time to invest in our capabilities to gain market share across our diverse geographic footprint total projected deposit balances are revised upward to end relatively flat to year end spot balances the fourth quarter net interest income is expected to be between million and million assuming no additional interest rate hikes for the rest of the year fourth quarter noninterest income is expected to be around million which is similar to our guidance levels for the first three quarters of the year as we continue to benefit from our strategy of diversified feebased businesses fourth quarter guidance for noninterest expense is expected to be between million and million driven by increased investment spend and the impact of the inflationary macroeconomic environment full year provision guidance is revised to a tighter band of million to million and will be dependent on net loan growth and chargeoff activity in the fourth quarter lastly the full year effective tax rate should be between and and the fourth quarter effective tax rate is expected to be between and reflecting benefits of investment tax credits generated through the financing transactions of our commercial leasing business in the quarter with that i will turn the call back to vince vincent j delie jr chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania once again this quarters financial performance was achieved

strengthening our capital and liquidity position given the strength in our performance fnb is well prepared to meet the needs of our consumer and business clients with a broad array of products and services a strong balance sheet and a commitment to achieving success for all of our stakeholders thank you question and answer section operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from daniel tamayo from raymond james please go ahead daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning guys wondering if you could talk a little bit about updated thoughts on when you think the margin might bottom and if you had any more details on what the month of september look like from a margin perspective and yields ph potentially vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah good morning danny i guess couple of comments on that i think given everything industrys withstood this year clearly the peak was in the first quarter if you look at our net interest income for the third quarter we only declined million in a nim compression as i commented on moderated to basis points after decreasing basis points last quarter the monthly decline in nim has been averaging around basis points a month since may so its been i mean its been coming down but pretty steady within that range our outlook for the fourth quarter of the million to million doesnt have any rate increases as i mentioned with the decline in margin kind of similar to what we saw in the third quarter is kind of whats baked into our guidance daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thats helpful appreciate it and then kind of moving over to loan growth im just curious how youre thinking about loan growth potentially next year if the economy does slow its sustained at a pretty strong growth level here throughout the in particular physicians first and the residential mortgage book but just curious on kind of higher level thoughts about the ability to sustain that kind of loan growth vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i think first of all i think that were in a really strong position relative to many competitors particularly made smaller banks who are struggling with capital and liquidity issues so it puts us in a position where fnb can become we go on the offense basically and were able to go after more opportunities with confidence we can support our clients capital needs as we move through we didnt give guidance for so i cant really fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 speak to specific numbers but my expectation moving into next year is its going to be choppy for everybody from a loan demand perspective i think for us to be successful were going to have to stay very focused on maximizing or growing market share in the markets that weve moved into where there still continues to be good solid growth in those markets from a gdp perspective i think thats one thing that will help us secondarily i think given the size span of the company today versus where we were four years ago we have multiple markets to pursue opportunities in so i think going into depending on how the economy shakes out it will be more challenging to find credit worthy borrowers that we would want to bank right in that environment i think its going to be more competitive so i think having the right people spread across those areas would be a benefit to us versus somebody thats heavily concentrated in say pennsylvania or ohio so i think all of that will play in our favor i think weve also invested pretty heavily in certain platforms that will continue to drive fee income for us so in addition to loan growth we did perform pretty well from a fee income perspective given the pressures that we were facing but weve invested in our digital platform which should help us in small business and gathering deposits as we move into this fall and the common app is fully built out weve invested pretty heavily in treasury management systems our payment processing capabilities and lockbox capability that we still offer clients has been upgraded in the last year or so capital markets weve built out our ability to participate in our the ph bond offering for debt capital markets platform and that continues to perform well for us and enables us to move up market and participate in lower risk transactions and still meet the return thresholds that we have internally so all of that will play well for us as we move into next year so those are the reasons why i feel more confident about our performance this quarter and then into next quarter but i will caution you i think the macroeconomic environment will play a role demand has to be there as well so ph the capital investment has to be occurring anyway on the commercial side daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc thats terrific color i appreciate all that color ill step back thanks guys vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania okay thank you operator the next question comes from michael perito from kbw please go ahead michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning guys thanks for taking my questions i wanted to start on a comment you made vince about making investments on the opex side and trying to take advantage of indiscernible i was wondering if you guys are willing to kind of go layer deeper on that i mean i think its evident and obvious from the financials that you guys are in a strong position here so what type of investments are you looking at what do you think could make the biggest difference as you look to the next months here and obviously still have some growth opportunities in front of you and a lot of peers that probably have some opportunities but dont have the balance sheets to really kind of fully take advantage of them fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania im sorry you broke up a little bit youre speaking specifically to digital is that your question michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah i mean i imagine most of the things youre looking at are digital but just more broadly any like initiatives or kind of areas of investment that you guys are particularly focused on that you think could be pretty fruitful over the next months in terms of kind of continuing growth and being able to take share while the industry is in a weaker position vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah well first of all i think its a great question and weve talked about this internally there are two paths to go down as we move into next year i mean lets face it the banking industry in general is facing margin compression some banks are struggling to grow revenue its highly competitive from a depository perspective so i certainly understand why theres a lot of caution moving into next year but i think given our position we have strong capital were in a strong capital position we have tremendous liquidity we have made investments in de novo expansion in the retail space which are coming online expense comes along with that so weve already started to invest in those projects and youll see depreciation expense coming online with those but were at the point now where they should start to generate revenue or contribute to our effort right because we launched a number of them at the beginning of this year late last year so we should be seeing some good success there and those are principally in higher growth markets that are not feeling as much pain as some of the other more legacy markets from a growth perspective so were very optimistic about the performance there were also optimistic about our buildout of the common app that i spoke about you can purchase multiple loan products on our platform today by the end of this quarter well be able to buy multiple loan products and multiple depository products with one application and the trainings going on and weve been doing training on our systems and on our capabilities for some time i think youre going to start to see that pay off we also changed our model in the branches several years ago in the consumer bank we started rolling out relationship bankers instead of having tellers and platform people so more highly trained bankers in the branches were finally closing out the last region in terms of converting those folks over to this higher profile banking position which should help with crosssell and driving product sales in the branches beyond just doing transactions and then we have bankers basically there are a number of bankers that are pulling back in other institutions so i think well have opportunities to go after business that presents itself that weve been for companies that weve been calling on for a long time in the commercial space weve made investments in so to be more specific weve made investments in treasury management which i think will assist us in becoming primary client for indiscernible market and larger company we made investments in the digital platforms to help us go after more share of wallet more quickly right with clients by presenting more efficient platforms to onboard clients we invested pretty heavily in our institutional capabilities from a capital market perspective indiscernible the client so i think really we have a number of areas that we work on and i think that were definitely going to experience better than peer results because of it so thats my commentary we also by the way built out our small business lending platform we continue to focus on that our plan is to integrate merchant and treasury management services into a bundled program similar to the common app so that is going to be worked on in the first quarter of next year we have about clients that are either fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 depository or loan clients in the small business segment so theres quite a bit i think we have about to penetration with merchant in that space so theres quite a bit of opportunity there from a fee income perspective weve been focusing on that moving into next year so those are some of the strategic investments that weve made and i do believe that at this time it makes sense for this company to continue to pursue those investments and drive revenue growth during it might be more difficult for others to do that michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah no that makes a lot of sense so thats great flavor thank you for walking through all that and just lastly for me and then ill step back and let someone else jump in just curious more of a highlevel question and a nearterm question but as you think about the franchise besides the growth projections i imagine you guys have constant conversations with the board and the executive team around what the right level of capitalization is and obviously at the higher end of the spectrum on the asset side theres a lot of conversations about capital im just curious what any updated thoughts around what you think kind of the right capital level for fnb is like over the next few years here i mean do you think its a higher number than maybe what it was over the last months i mean obviously you dont have to get there right now but just kind of curious what the conversation is internally around capital just given everything thats happened and as you think about taking share and continuing to grow the balance sheet moving forward vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania well we cover capital and liquidity position in the company in every board meeting that we have so we have indiscernible go over various elements of our financial performance we discuss the balance sheet in detail and strategies around maximizing returns that happens in every board meeting and then we talk about what the investors expect and what the street expects and how were performing relative to those expectations i think capital is a topic that weve had on the table for a long time i think given the aoci impairment that youve seen impact other capital position we were viewed as having less capital because we actually operate with a lower risk profile within the commercial loan categories that we participate in in the consumer indiscernible were very conservative but if you look at where we are today with cet1 at our tce ratio is and growing we feel pretty comfortable with where we are from a capital perspective i understand that billion and greater were going to see greater expectations from regulators for capital but i think given where we are today were in one of the better positions weve been in years we have a very solid portfolio weve spent a lot of time and energy garys done a tremendous job derisking that portfolio with the sale of regency the sale of hospitality the sales with adverse credits and we basically have done a lot weve moved over billion off the balance sheet before the pandemic even occurred so i think were in a great position from a capital perspective we feel comfortable where we are today and we address it in every board meeting and if you look at our returns on tangible common equity were upper quartile so even with higher capital ratios were still an indiscernible so pretty good solid performance and profitability michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc right all right thank you vince i appreciate you taking my questions today fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania one more thing on capital by the way weve dividended out over billion or through share repurchases or dividends over a billion in capital deployment to shareholders as well so i think when you think about the company and capital management thats part of the discussions that we have with the board just to throw that in there so our shareholders have benefited from that distribution of capital immensely and obviously we have retained that capital weve much higher capital ratios that part of the equation we feel that we need to evaluate where we are every quarter but anyway sorry michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc no i appreciate all the color thank you guys vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania indiscernible okay thank you operator operator instructions and the next question comes from manuel navas from da davidson please go ahead manuel navas q analyst d a davidson co hey good morning just want to follow up indiscernible manuel navas q analyst d a davidson co on the nim hey what are thoughts on where it could bottom next year just kind of an update there and then i have a followup on deposits vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah im not sure that i indiscernible guidance for next year ill let vince answer the question go ahead vince vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania no i was just indiscernible vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania a little bit color where we are today fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania i mean as far as indiscernible guidance for next year in january but i mean i think as i mentioned fourth quarter kind of coming down at a similar level to third quarter and i mean maybe first half of the year next year but again we have to do our we just started our budget process for next year so i think theres still some movement down exactly when it bottoms is a hard thing to call for sure but somewhere in the kind of middle of would be kind of based on where things are today but they could change by the time we finalize our budget and put out guidance in january but the compression i talked about is clearly its moderated if the fourth quarter comes down similar to the third quarter the net interest income as i mentioned earlier only came down million so i think the sustainability of the net interest income is very important right and driving our efficiency ratio in the low50 as a key part of it so more to come in january as far as what level ph it actually might bottom at so its definitely moderated the compression as i commented on manuel navas q analyst d a davidson co all right i appreciate the color there on deposits the cd engine is definitely powerful its what customers are looking for are you seeing do you have some breakdown on what youre seeing from is that from new customers current customers bringing over more funds can you just kind of talk through where youre winning there vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would say vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i think its a indiscernible vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania indiscernible vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania indiscernible sorry vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania indiscernible go ahead vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania no i was just going to say i think its a combination of all of the above right i think your part of the strategy was to persuade folks to bring additional dollars over so some of the campaigns focused principally on that the fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 money market offering some of the cd offerings that we have i think weve had quite a bit of success bringing in new customers so north of of the new money that comes in is new customers so its better than but its worth lets put it that way but i think the principal reason why were successful and weve been able to manage the betas and the migration a little better really is because of the insight that we have in our customer base with the tools that we put into place with ai and i guess data scientists and the data hub that we have we were able to just spend a lot of time analyzing behavior and i think thats really helped us with pricing and weve been a little more disciplined than others i think if you look at our cost of funds our margins were a little better so it kind of shows there but i also believe that being the principal bank for consumers and businesses as i said in my remarks is critically important and that requires a consistent investment in technology treasury management services all the things that i mentioned earlier so they both go hand in hand manuel navas q analyst d a davidson co i appreciate that do you have a rough percent on a rough average rate on the new cds or whats your current best offer and then just talk about the indiscernible manuel navas q analyst d a davidson co in the muni book briefly vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah vince i dont know i dont have those details at the tip of my fingers do you have that vince vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would say i mean a couple things the rates and the promotional cds and money market rates have been right around little below or a little above so weve had as vince said with all the data analytics supporting it and the tools we have in place weve brought in close to million in new money really since may through that and thats kind of benefited the overall balance sheet and then the muni flows ive always talked about is million to million is kind of the range of what comes in and during the most recent quarters its at the higher end of that and really kind of spread throughout the category its as the small amount is really in the dda and most of its more in the money market and sweep accounts where that money flows through and that peaks and troughs as you go through the year kind of builds through october november and then the first quarter is always the trough of that manuel navas q analyst d a davidson co well i appreciate that and then just switching topics switching gears for a second what are kind of updated thoughts on buyback you just had so much growth this quarter is that the main kind of limiter there and obviously that probably comes first organic growth but can you just kind of walk through where buyback fits in given that cet1 is above your target fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania sure i can comment on that i mean vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania go ahead vince vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah indiscernible so were a little above our target i think during the second quarter when we were active there were great opportunities to put some money to work there and in the third quarter with the growth we had plus the timing of the special assessment there was an expectation that might happen in the third quarter and just due to uncertainty we decided not to be active during the third quarter its as always were committed to managing capital in a manner thats fully aligned with shareholders so were closely monitoring it we may become active in the fourth quarter but we want to really see how the overall environment plays out but clearly theres room to do that and with the dividend payout ratio that weve all worked really hard to get down to we now have flexibility and the strong earnings generation that we have where this number will build and well put it to work loan growth staying strong well use that to support loan growth thats always our kind of first and best indiscernible vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah ph hey vince the other thing i wanted to mention is the tax credit transaction that we closed this quarter some folks have asked is that like a onetime event no we actually have a business that pursues tax credit transactions particularly in the energy field so weve done a number of them over the last few years in the group theres a pipeline of tax credit transactions that we pursue so sometimes its lumpy because it takes time to build out indiscernible deal or it takes time to get certified and get that stuff up and running because they actually have to be ph delivering power right before you can start a process from a financial perspective but it is a business that we have its in our corporate finance area and theyve done a terrific job over the last few years so i would expect that to continue as well into next year because weve developed that expertise and were confident that the people that we have doing that indiscernible and his team have done indiscernible very well positioned to keep pursuing opportunities i would add that to the mix as well because it doesnt show up the same way from a profitability perspective because we booked an asset that has a very low margin rate that ends up impacting margin and then we get a tax benefit and then you also say well what youre just winning on a tax benefit but thats actually part of the profitability the extension of the credit just so everybody understand so some folks have asked us about that and i wanted to make sure we were clear that thats something that we pursue on an ongoing basis and will be additive to next year as well manuel navas q analyst d a davidson co and it provides capital too right fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah manuel navas q analyst d a davidson co i appreciate that added color thank you vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you operator right the next question comes from frank schiraldi from piper sandler please go ahead frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co good morning hey guys in terms of the vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey frank frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co guide for nii you mentioned no additional rate hikes if we do get a november or december rate hike i mean just wondering is that meaningful anymore in terms of what that adds on an annualized basis to nii and maybe if you could just talk a little bit about how youre managing the balance sheet sensitivity for the higher for longer rate outlook thanks vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania sure vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would say any indiscernible vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania no go ahead vincent fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i mean any rate movement frank right its late in the quarter doesnt really do much for the fourth quarter so there is not much benefit that we get there and with where rates are i mean its not that big of an impact even to next year i mean if you look at our irr position weve been kind of gradually moving towards neutral as each quarter has gone by were kind of naturally getting there when you look at when our irr stats will be out in the q i mean the plus ph ramp to a minus ramp is probably so theres actually a benefit both ways because you have the rates on loans investment securities were putting on continue to be higher than the portfolio rate so you kind of get benefits from that but basis points in the grand scheme of things it doesnt its not going to do that much and well bake it into the guidance in january when we give it out but its really not going to move the dial frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay and then just thinking about the expense guide is it right way to think about that you talked a lot about the investments being made should we think more about that as an acceleration of investments and potentially so theres a potential leg down in expense or given everything you guys are doing is that just better to think about as run rate at this point vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i can vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania vince i dont know if you want to comment vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania sure i can comment on that i mean as vince talked about weve continuously invested in the company and you know that frank ph it covered us for a long time so its part of how we run the company investing to generate future revenue and weve been able to do that maintaining very good efficiency ratio in the low50 so its just part of running the business and conversations we have internally are always about focusing our capex spend where we can drive future revenue and investing in markets right weve entered new markets through the de novo strategy through expanding our indiscernible charleston and markets that are very attractive so thats also part of the investment is investing in those new markets which then generates future revenue for us i mean the expenses in the fourth quarter its always at the end of the year it can be a little lumpy finishing up ph incentive and accruals and those types of things that comes in so when we do our guidance in january for next year well have a cost savings target as we have every year i mean weve taken out million or so in cost as weve grown and created the scale so thats always part of how we run the company and the initiatives that vince talked about the de novos digital investments infrastructure to support that growth we focus on generating that positive operating leverage and having a low50 efficiency ratio so its not easy but its a focus within the company and i think investments have served us well so itll continue to be part of it so its not really a step function to it frank its a good question but its really just part of how we run the company fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay great and then just lastly on the tax rate and the renewable energy transaction and totally get thats just part of the deal thats just part of the economics or these tax credits that you get would you say that if i look at the guide its a bit lower id say than your rate over the last several quarters except for this is that would you say thats kind of lumpy too is there kind of more activity expected in or is that just has that business just ramped up to a degree where you could see that as potentially sustainable vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah the fourth quarters level frank is really tied to the same solar deal that we just closed in the third quarter the bulk of the tax credit gets recorded in the third quarter and then theres carry carryover kind of smoothing out the effective tax rate for the year that also benefits the fourth quarter and that kind of indiscernible for this transaction but indiscernible theres a pipeline of transactions that we continue to go after and the team is already working actively on others that could happen next year and into but the is really just tied to this transaction and kind of the smoothing of it into the fourth quarter frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co got it okay thats helpful thank you vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania all right thanks vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah thank you operator operator instructions and our next question comes from brian martin from janney montgomery please go ahead brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott hey good morning guys just a vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania hi brian brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott hey just one for me on back to the margin just for a minute vince i guess the appreciate the color on the abatement of the funding pressure here in but i guess as far as the ddas go i mean i guess the contraction fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 slowed a bit again this quarter just kind of wondering if you think were nearing a bottom there just how youre thinking about that in general and maybe just an update on kind of when new loan production is coming on vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would say i guess let me talk to vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania i dont know go ahead vince indiscernible which vince brian was asking go ahead vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania well i can comment on the loans and then maybe vince if you want to talk about the strategy of noninterest bearing afterwards thatll probably be good the new loans that we made during the third quarter they came on at which was up from in the second quarter so the commercial loans came on in and mortgage is in the midtohigh during the third quarter and those are kind of mid as we sit here today just given where mortgage rates are so a pretty good level and above overall portfolio yield so youre getting that benefit coming through i mean the overall portfolio rate on a spot basis went up ph basis points with that higher level of made rates indiscernible loans that we made versus where the portfolio is and then we have a slide in the deck brian ph that youre familiar with i mean the noninterestbearing deposits has been a focus as long as ive been here and vince before me weve grown from to i think we peaked at we were kind of precovid right and were going to work hard to keep that number as high as we can and its just part of everything we do every ph week at pricing every outcome meeting every board meeting vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah its actually on page in the investor deck brian and we comment indiscernible but if you look it goes to what ive been saying strategically our goal was to drive up noninterest bearing deposits basically i know during the lower interest rate environment people didnt value them as much i used to talk about them all the time talk about our performance here and people didnt pay attention because back then the benefit the indiscernible benefit wasnt that great but today it really provides us with a pretty substantial buffer from a margin perspective and if you go back to we were at demand deposits and i mean you then can see the surge coming in with stimulus so were feeling pretty good about where we are we focused on client primacy indiscernible he has that he has the trademark on that so he calls it client primacy its our internal strategy to make sure that were the principal depository bank and disbursement bank for consumers and businesses and again we continue to make investments in de novo branch locations to drive new households where we can be the disbursement bank on the consumer side weve invested in digital weve invested in indiscernible products and services like i said the payment hub that we put in place and some of the other products that we just rolled out that help us establish ourselves as the principal depository bank thats why these demand deposits dont move fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 around that much so relative to others theyre not its not just cash parked here i mean in many instances those balances are being used to cover services the balances have to remain to cover disbursements that go on throughout a month or a week so its pretty much embedded so were feeling pretty confident about our deposit mix here thats not to say there wasnt pressure because when rates were lower of course companies and individuals including myself were a little sloppy about leaving their money sitting in demand deposits so thats changed i think the consumers expect and the businesses expect to invest those balances given the returns they can achieve today so i think weve demonstrated here over a pretty long period of time that we are a very solid depository institution with a heavy emphasis on low cost funding sources anyway hope thats helps you brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott yeah no thats helpful it sounds like its still could go a bit lower but still the better than peer and holding up well so okay and then maybe indiscernible brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott go ahead vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i think well outperform the peers i cant speak to where were going to be in the future because who knows i cant predict interest rates indiscernible but i think that were going to outperform because of our business model so thats brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott yeah got you okay makes sense indiscernible brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott maybe just one for gary on the reserve i mean the reserve is down a touch this quarter its still pretty healthy level inclusive of the marks but just kind of wondering how to think about the reserve in conjunction with the strength in credit gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah brian in terms of the reserve i mean its a constant focus from our perspective at and were the unamortized discounts i mean its upper quartile strong compared to peers and we feel good about where it is and the position of the portfolio here entering the end of the year so i would expect it to continue to track similarly as we go forward fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott okay and remind me gary i think there was indiscernible this quarter some other banks with a indiscernible portfolio how big your indiscernible portfolio is today gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah indiscernible portfolio today is billion 40pluspercent of it is investment grade and essentially the balance of it is essentially right up against investment grade so that portfolio has performed extremely well its extremely strong our focus we dont buy paper our focus is really on customers that we know and customers in our market so you know that focus has really proven itself very well in that portfolio over a long period of time weve generated significant deposits that vince has referenced around that portfolio as well and continues to perform exceptionally well so very strong portfolio brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott got you okay vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania i hate to answer question now because you cant compare every banks syndicated loan portfolios so on the buy side in particular were not a leveraged finance player were buying indiscernible if we participate in a deal because we think were going to get ancillary business were participating in bond economics indiscernible customers one of the rules we have is that our bankers have to have a relationship with the company they cant just rely on bank of america or pnc to bring us into a deal those are thats a different type of portfolio than having a indiscernible portfolio that you just go out and buy leverage transactions in for yield so to garys point weve a big chunk of investment grade credits in that syndication portfolio and then also we ph lead in number of credits because we have a syndication indiscernible so that would be included in that number where were indiscernible so all of that needs to be taken into consideration indiscernible gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah as vince indicated were not in the leveraged finance business we dont have a private equity business its really customers in our markets that we call on and have relationships with so its been a very strong book of business for us brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott got you i appreciate all the color there and then maybe just last one was on the commercial and consumer pipeline i know youre not giving any guidance on but just kind of given the growth this quarter just kind of want to see where the pipelines are at today relative to last quarter just ph have you frame it fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania indiscernible were coming off of the previous linked quarter so typically what happens is the pipelines indiscernible i think were down between and in most of the markets i just looked at the statistics across the markets we track it pretty rigorously so id say down to but still building i think when you look at the portfolio overall the dynamics of our commercial loan portfolio one i think that attrition has slowed dramatically because of the climb in rates so thats going to help stabilize the balances thats number one number two i think demand for capital has slowed going into next year so thats part of why the pipelines have slowed or increased a little bit particularly i focus more on the day pipeline which is down about or thats what i tend to focus on because we look at it both ways right indiscernible in the short run and i think it will build again going into next year obviously depending on what happens with interest rates and the economy overall but im pretty confident that indiscernible and then the third thing i wanted to mention was that utilization rates have declined slightly which is an indication that theres a pullback so were seeing in the commercial book to decline in utilization rates and to me thats an indicator that the borrowers are ph were kind of pulled back a little bit brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott got you and in those pipelines vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania hope thats helpful brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott yeah the pipelines youre talking to lower both for consumer and commercial or was that just primarily commercial vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania no im sorry i was speaking only to commercial indiscernible consumer is the pipelines for consumer depends on which indiscernible we want to talk mortgage so we have more mortgages than we need indiscernible were basically becoming more competitive to push indiscernible off the balance sheet right so were more competitive in the conforming space which impacts margin a little bit to get it off the balance sheet weve been very successful growing indiscernible business so im not too worried about that small business has performed pretty well pipelines are up thats physicians first program indiscernible healthcare as you kind of paid off for that group we have some really good people that we brought on ahead of our small business lending area has specific expertise in healthcare which is why were developing those products that i mentioned earlier in the call the pipeline there looks pretty good and i think we do have an opportunity moving into as i said in the small business segment which falls under consumer to grow that book of business i mean we have a boatload of small business customers across seven states i mentioned to customers so our small business fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 pipeline in the most recent quarter was at record levels and i would expect us to continue to capitalize on that i know it doesnt contribute as much to the total but that should bode well for the retail consumer bank but thats where we are i dont really were not anticipating issues with the mortgage or so the mortgage is tougher right in higher interest rate environment the majority of the loans that were originating across a pretty broad footprint are purchase money loans and weve invested pretty heavily indiscernible platform recently so were pretty confident we can achieve better than peer results in the mortgage business like we have and then that leads to home equity opportunities and other opportunities in the consumer segment and with the application that we rolled out we also think thatll help us in so being able to open depository account and apply for a home equity loan simultaneously will help us originate loans in the consumer space brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott got you okay and the last one for me was just on the efficiency just it feels like given the comments about managing expenses and what we we saw this quarter that we should think of the low50 efficiency ratio as kind of a sustainable level here going forward vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah we target weve always said we target to thats what we hope to achieve we want to stay obviously as low as possible right because ph were on incentive to keep expenses low here part of our incentive program so i think that were going to be very diligent but i also think given our capital liquidity our digital investment what we have going on here we need to stay focused on growing revenue as we move through this difficult time were capable of managing risk very effectively and i think were in a very strong position to grow as we move into so on the revenue side i believe well have an opportunity to manage at least contribute to positive operating leverage indiscernible relative to the peers so there is expense build but theres also revenue growth coming along with that so thats kind of the strategy its been the strategy for a long time i know theres periods where its lumpy and people ask why your efficiency ratio is moving you can see the results over a long period of time weve been an outperformer relative to the peers for decades i believe so anyway thats where we are brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott perfect thanks for taking all the questions guys vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah thank you gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks brian operator this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference
