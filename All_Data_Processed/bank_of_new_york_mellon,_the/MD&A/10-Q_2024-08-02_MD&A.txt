jan asu investmentsequity method and joint ventures topic accounting for investments in tax credit structures using the proportional amortization method in march the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu investmentsequity method and joint ventures topic accounting for investments in tax credit structures using the proportional amortization method which permits reporting entities to elect to account for their tax equity investments regardless of the tax credit program from which the income tax credits are received using the proportional amortization method if certain conditions are met under the proportional amortization method an entity amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the income tax credits and other income tax benefits received and recognizes the net amortization and income tax credits and other income tax benefits in the income statement as a component of the provision for income taxes we adopted this guidance on jan1 the

the total potential loss on undrawn lending commitments standby and commercial letters of credit and securities lending indemnifications is equal to the total notional amount if drawn upon which does not consider the value of any collateral since many of the lending commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon the total amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements a summary of lending commitment bny notes to consolidated financial statements continued maturities is as follows billion in less than one year billion in one to five years and million over five years sblcs principally support obligations of corporate clients and were collateralized with cash and securities of million at june and million at dec at june billion of the sblcs will expire within one year and million in one to five years no sblcs expire in over five years we must recognize at the inception of an sblc and foreign and other guarantees a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee the fair value of the liability which was recorded with a corresponding asset in other assets was estimated as the present value of contractual customer fees the estimated liability for losses related to sblcs and foreign and other guarantees if any is included in the allowance for lending related commitments paymentperformance risk of sblcs is monitored using

paymentperformance risk the table below shows sblcs by investment grade standby letters of credit investment grade noninvestment grade june dec a commercial letter of credit is normally a shortterm instrument used to finance a commercial contract for the shipment of goods from a seller to a buyer although the commercial letter of credit is contingent upon the satisfaction of specified conditions it represents a credit exposure if the buyer defaults on the underlying transaction as a result the total contractual amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements commercial letters of credit totaled million at june and million at dec we expect many of the lending commitments and letters of credit to expire without the need to advance any cash the revenue associated with guarantees frequently depends on the credit rating of the obligor and the structure of the transaction including collateral if any the allowance for lendingrelated commitments was million at june and million at dec a securities lending transaction is a fully collateralized transaction in which the owner of a security agrees to lend the security typically through an agent in our case the bank of new york mellon to a borrower usually a broker dealer or bank on an open overnight or term basis under the terms of a prearranged contract we typically lend securities with indemnification against borrower default we generally require the borrower to provide collateral with a minimum value of of the fair value of the securities borrowed which is monitored on a daily basis thus reducing credit risk market risk can also arise in securities lending transactions these risks are controlled through policies limiting the level of risk that can be undertaken securities lending transactions are generally entered into only with highly rated counterparties securities lending indemnifications were secured by collateral of billion at june and billion at dec cibc mellon a joint venture between bny and the canadian imperial bank of commerce cibc engages in securities lending activities cibc mellon bny and cibc jointly and severally indemnify securities lenders against specific types of

repurchase agreements indemnification arrangements we have provided standard representations for underwriting agreements acquisition and divestiture agreements sales of loans and commitments and other similar types of arrangements and customary indemnification for claims and legal proceedings related to providing financial services that are not otherwise included above insurance has been purchased to mitigate certain of these risks generally there are no stated or notional amounts included in these indemnifications and the contingencies triggering the obligation for indemnification are not expected to occur furthermore often counterparties to these transactions provide us with comparable indemnifications we are unable to develop an estimate of the maximum payout under these indemnifications for several reasons in addition to the lack of a stated or notional amount in a majority of such indemnifications we are unable to predict the nature of events that would trigger indemnification or the level of indemnification for a certain event we believe however that the possibility that we will have to make any material payments for these indemnifications is remote at june and dec we have not recorded any material liabilities under these arrangements clearing and settlement exchanges we are a noncontrolling equity investor in andor member of several industry clearing or settlement exchanges through which foreign exchange securities derivatives or other transactions settle certain of these industry clearing and settlement exchanges require their members to guarantee their obligations and liabilities andor to provide liquidity support in the event other members do not honor their obligations we believe the likelihood that a clearing or settlement exchange of which we are a member would become insolvent is remote additionally certain settlement exchanges have implemented loss allocation policies that enable the exchange to allocate settlement losses to the members of the exchange it is not possible to quantify such marktomarket loss until the loss occurs any ancillary costs bny that occur as a result of any marktomarket loss cannot be quantified in addition we also sponsor clients as members on clearing and settlement exchanges and guarantee their obligations at june and dec we did not record any material liabilities under these arrangements legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business the bank of new york mellon corporation and its subsidiaries are routinely named as defendants in or made parties to pending and potential legal actions we also are subject to governmental and regulatory examinations informationgathering requests investigations and proceedings both formal and informal claims for significant monetary damages are often asserted in many of these legal actions while claims for disgorgement restitution penalties andor other remedial actions or sanctions may be sought in governmental and regulatory matters it is inherently difficult to predict the eventual outcomes of such matters given their complexity and the particular facts and circumstances at issue in each of these matters however on the basis of our current knowledge and understanding we do not believe that judgments settlements or orders if any arising from these matters either individually or in the aggregate after giving effect to applicable reserves and insurance coverage will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of bny although they could have a material effect on our results of operations in a given period in view of the inherent unpredictability of outcomes in litigation and regulatory matters particularly where i the damages sought are substantial or indeterminate ii the proceedings are in the early stages or iii the matters involve novel legal theories or a large number of parties as a matter of course there is considerable uncertainty surrounding the timing or ultimate resolution of litigation and regulatory matters including a possible eventual loss fine penalty or business impact if any associated with each such matter in accordance with applicable accounting guidance we establish accruals for litigation and regulatory matters when those matters proceed to a stage where they present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable in such cases there may be a possible exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued we regularly monitor such matters for developments that could affect the amount of the accrual and will notes to consolidated financial statements continued adjust the accrual amount as appropriate if the loss contingency in question is not both probable and reasonably estimable we do not establish an accrual and the matter continues to be monitored for any developments that would make the loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable we believe that our accruals for legal proceedings are appropriate and in the aggregate are not material to the consolidated financial position of bny although future accruals could have a material effect on the results of operations in a given period in addition if we have the potential to recover a portion of an estimated loss from a third party we record a receivable up to the amount of the accrual that is probable of recovery for certain of those matters described here for which a loss contingency may in the future be reasonably possible whether in excess of a related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability bny is currently unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss for those matters described here where bny is able to estimate a reasonably possible loss the aggregate range of such reasonably possible loss is up to million in excess of the accrued liability if any related to those matters for matters where a reasonably possible loss is denominated in a foreign currency our estimate is adjusted quarterly based on prevailing exchange rates we do not consider potential recoveries when estimating reasonably possible losses the following describes certain judicial regulatory and arbitration proceedings

for refinements in revenue and expense allocation methodologies refinements are typically reflected on a prospective basis there were no reclassifications or organizational changes in the second quarter of in the first quarter of we made certain realignments of similar products and services within our lines of business the largest change was the movement of institutional solutions from

related to restricted stock and restricted stock units is allocated to the segments support and other indirect expenses including services provided between segments that are not provided to third parties or not subject to a revenue transfer agreement are allocated to the businesses based on internally developed methodologies and reflected in noninterest expense recurring fdic expense is
