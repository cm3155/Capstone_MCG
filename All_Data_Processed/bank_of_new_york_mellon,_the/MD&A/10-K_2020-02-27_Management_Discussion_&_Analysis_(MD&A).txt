could continue to be impacted by the current environment since march the vast majority of our employees have worked from home they have been fully operational with minimal disruption to servicing our clients however our continued reliance on results of operations continued workfromhome arrangements may result in increased operational risks market volatility associated with the performance of global equity and fixed income markets and lower interest rates has had and may continue to have a considerable impact on all of our businesses our lowerrisk diversified feebased business model benefits from heightened volatility and a flightto quality on a relative basis compared with other credit focused financial institutions our investment services businesses were favorably impacted by higher client volumes in compared with the prior year the significant increases in market volatility also resulted in increased client activity in foreign exchange and higher asset servicing clearing services in pershing as well as clearance and collateral management fee revenue however the heightened volumes and volatility experienced in the first quarter of declined over the remainder of this volatility coupled with the interest rate environment also led to an increase in deposit levels from the prior year as our clients increased the levels of cash placed with us this favorably impacted net interest revenue however the low interest rate environment has more than offset that benefit and is expected to continue to reduce our net interest revenue and margin given the decrease in shortterm interest rates there was a significant increase in money market mutual fund fees that were waived which reduced fee revenue for both our investment services and investment and wealth

not limited to equity investments goodwill and intangibles it is difficult to forecast the impact of the coronavirus together with related public health measures on our results with certainty because

continued review of businesses we have an internal information system that produces performance data along product and service lines for our two principal businesses investment services and investment and wealth management and the other segment business accounting principles our business data has been determined on an internal management basis of accounting rather than the generally accepted accounting principles gaap used for consolidated financial reporting these measurement principles are designed so that reported results of the businesses will track their economic performance for information on the accounting principles of our businesses the primary products and services in each line of business the primary types of revenue by business and how our businesses are presented and analyzed see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements business results are subject to reclassification when organizational changes are made or for refinements in revenue and expense allocation methodologies refinements are typically reflected on a prospective basis in we reclassified the results of certain services provided between the segments from noninterest expense to fee and other revenue the intersegment activity is eliminated in the other segment and relates to services that are also provided to third parties and provides consistency with the reporting of the revenues this adjustment had no impact on income before taxes of the businesses also in we reclassified the results related to certain lending activities from the wealth management business to the pershing business these loans were originated by the wealth management business as a service to pershing clients this resulted in an increase in total revenue noninterest expense and income before taxes in the pershing business and a corresponding decrease in the wealth management business prior periods were restated for both reclassifications the results of our businesses may be influenced by client and other activities that vary by quarter in the first quarter staff expense typically increases reflecting the vesting of longterm stock awards for retirementeligible employees in the third quarter depositary receipts revenue is typically higher due to an increased level of client dividend payments also in the third quarter volumerelated fees may decline due to reduced client activity and staff expense typically increases reflecting the annual employee merit increase in the fourth quarter we typically incur higher business development and marketing expenses however was an exception given the impact of the coronavirus pandemic in our investment and wealth management business performance fees are typically higher in the fourth and first quarters as those quarters represent the end of the measurement period for many of the performance feeeligible relationships the results of our businesses may also be impacted by the translation of financial results denominated in foreign currencies to the us dollar we are primarily impacted by activities denominated in the british pound and the euro on a consolidated basis and in our investment services business we typically have more foreign currencydenominated expenses than revenues however our investment and wealth management business typically has more foreign currencydenominated revenues than expenses overall currency fluctuations impact the yearover year growth rate in the investment and wealth management business more than the investment services business however currency fluctuations in isolation are not expected to significantly impact net income on a consolidated basis fee revenue in investment and wealth management and to a lesser extent in investment services is impacted by the value of market indices at dec

securities accepting deposits investing in securities lending raising money as needed to fund assets and other transactions the market risks from these activities include interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk our primary market risk is exposure to movements in us dollar interest rates and certain foreign currency interest rates we actively manage interest rate sensitivity and use earnings simulation and discounted cash flow models to identify interest rate exposures an earnings simulation model is the primary tool used to assess changes in pretax net interest revenue the model incorporates managements assumptions regarding interest rates market spreads changes in the prepayment behavior of loans and securities and the impact of derivative financial instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes these assumptions have been developed through a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior and are inherently uncertain actual results may differ materially from projected results due to timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and managements strategies among other factors in the table below we use the earnings simulation model to run various interest rate ramp scenarios from a baseline scenario the interest rate ramp scenarios examine the impact of large interest rate movements in each scenario all currencies interest rates are shifted higher or lower typically the baseline scenario uses the average deposit balances of the last month of the quarter however during the month of december we experienced a significant increase in deposits and a corresponding increase in central bank placements to normalize the analysis we used the fourth quarter average for these balances the basis point ramp scenario assumes rates change basis points above or below the yield curve in each of the next four quarters and the basis point ramp scenario assumes a basis point per quarter change interest rate sensitivity quantified by calculating the change in pretax net interest revenue between the scenarios over a month measurement period the net interest revenue sensitivity methodology assumes static deposit levels and also assumes that no management actions will be taken to mitigate the effects of interest rate changes the following table shows net interest revenue sensitivity for bny mellon estimated changes in net interest revenue dec sept30 dec in millions up bps parallel rate ramp vs baseline a up bps parallel rate ramp vs baseline a down bps parallel rate ramp vs baseline a longterm up bps short term unchanged b longterm down bps shortterm unchanged b a in the parallel rate ramp both shortterm and longterm rates move in four equal quarterly increments b longterm is equal to or greater than one year the increases in the up and up basis point scenarios compared with sept were driven by increased deposits the increases in the scenarios compared with dec are primarily driven by increased deposit balances in addition the down basis point scenario was impacted by a change in our deposit assumptions specifically in we increased the amount of deposit balances to which we would pass through negative central bank rates in that scenario while the net interest revenue sensitivity scenarios calculations assume static deposit balances to facilitate consistent periodoverperiod comparisons it is likely that a portion of the recent monetary policydriven deposit inflows would runoff in rising rate environments such as the up bps and up bps parallel ramps noninterestbearing deposits are particularly sensitive to changes in shortterm rates to illustrate the net interest revenue sensitivity to deposit runoff we note that a billion instantaneous reduction of us dollar denominated noninterest bearing deposits would reduce the net interest revenue sensitivity results in the ramp up basis point and basis point scenarios in the table above by approximately million and approximately million respectively the impact would be smaller if the runoff was assumed to be a mixture of interest bearing and noninterestbearing deposits for a discussion of factors impacting the growth or contraction of deposits see risk factors our business financial condition and results of operations bny mellon results of operations continued could be adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our liquidity we also project future cash flows from our assets and liabilities over a longterm horizon and then discount these cash flows using instantaneous parallel shocks to prevailing interest rates this measure reflects the structural balance sheet interest rate sensitivity by discounting all future cash flows the aggregation of these discounted cash flows is the economic value of equity eve the following table shows how eve would change in response to changes in interest rates estimated changes in eve dec rate change up bps vs baseline up bps vs baseline the asymmetrical accounting treatment of the impact of a change in interest rates on our balance sheet may create a situation in which an increase in interest rates can adversely affect reported equity and regulatory bny mellon capital even though economically there may be no impact on our economic capital position for example an increase in rates will result in a decline in the value of our availableforsale securities portfolio in this example there is no corresponding change on our fixed liabilities even though economically these liabilities are more valuable as rates rise these results do not reflect strategies that management could employ to limit the impact as interest rate expectations change to manage foreign exchange risk we fund foreign currencydenominated assets with liability instruments denominated in the same currency we utilize various foreign exchange contracts if a liability denominated in the same currency is not available or desired and to minimize the earnings impact of translation gains or losses created by investments in foreign markets we use forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of our net investment in foreign operations at dec net investments in foreign operations totaled billion and were spread across foreign currencies
