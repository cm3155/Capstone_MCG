officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp thank you marius good morning everyone and thank you for joining us before emily takes you through our quarterly results id like to make a few broader comments on our performance in and on some areas of focus for as you can see on page of our financial highlights presentation we reported earnings per share for the full year of down compared to the prior year and a return on tangible common equity of excluding the impact of notable items we reported earnings per share of which was up yearoveryear and a return on tangible common equity of reflecting our solid underlying performance against the backdrop of a complex operating environment in our results this year included several notable items for example those related to russia in the first quarter and the goodwill impairment related to investment management in the third quarter and our fourth quarter results reflect the impact of a number of decisions that we made to improve our revenue growth and efficiency trajectory moving forward the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 excluding notable items revenues grew a little faster than expenses as we continued to see strength in client activity and volumes while continuously positioning ourselves to derive meaningful benefit from the upward move in interest rates together these factors more than offset the stiff headwinds from lower market levels on the back of organic growth in auca were continuing our role as the worlds largest custodian and we saw cumulative net inflows in assets under management beyond the numbers id like to highlight a couple of areas where im particularly encouraged by our performance in first our sales momentum which speaks to the strength of our client franchise and our capabilities in asset servicing we continue to elevate our client dialogue while maintaining a strong focus on service quality to support our clients through a difficult environment sales wins increased off a strong and were winning larger and highervalue deals which is where the elevation of client dialogue matters in etfs auca reached trillion as we saw strong net inflows throughout the year and the total number of funds serviced rose by and in alts we grew auca by and fund launches were up by over treasury services delivered strong broadbased growth throughout in the fourth quarter we announced a collaboration with conduent to be their trusted payments infrastructure provider as they launch a digital integrated payments hub for businesses and the public sector this hub will enable access to more secure faster and costeffective options to send request and receive payments and refunds in a matter of minutes using real time payments and other proven payment technologies and we also onboarded several new clients during the quarter as we continued to build our digital payments and related fx businesses and finally while was no doubt a difficult environment for the wealth market our wealth management business acquired more clients with particular strength in the ultrahigh net worth and family office segments and we continued to deepen existing relationships through our expanded banking offering where the percentage of advisory clients who also bank with us rose by about percentage points notwithstanding the tough backdrop pershing which is in fact our largest play as a company in the wealth space brought in net new assets of over billion representing growth in the fourth quarter we announced two very exciting wins demonstrating the broadbased capabilities that pershing is uniquely positioned to offer the first was state farm which is an exciting relationship given state farms size and reach with its thousands of agents across the country serving tens of millions of households and we also onboarded arta finance which was founded by a team of former google executives who are now leading a global digital family office that uses advanced technologies to empower investors with tools to invest intelligently this win is an important proof point of our proven set of apis and digital capabilities and demonstrates our ability to win with techforward clients the second area of performance ill call out is that we continue to forge ahead with our longerterm growth initiatives such as pershing x realtime payments the reimagining of custody and collateral and digital assets these initiatives will help position the company for the next leg of growth beyond the medium term we went live with our digital asset custody platform in the us in october and as i highlighted in my oped in the financial times a month ago this will continue to be a focus for us not so much for crypto but really the broader opportunity that exists across digital assets and distributed ledger technology if anything the recent events in the crypto market only further highlight the need for trusted regulated providers in the digital asset space we are also now live with our first release of pershing x just one year after launching the initiative this release to a small number of select clients includes three core products portfolio solutions including direct indexing client the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 servicing and data and reporting tools but equally importantly this release is about our ability to set a goal on a tight timeline and execute finally the third and probably most important highlight of the year for me is our people and our systems once again demonstrated remarkable resilience across the war in ukraine the extraordinary moves we saw in several government debt markets and volume surges the operational readiness of our people and our systems consistently enabled successful outcomes for our clients i cannot thank our people enough for their hard work and dedication to serving our clients while were proud of these accomplishments its also important to humbly recognize an area where we fell short this past year acknowledging the inflationary headwinds expense growth for a second straight year was around exnotables we consider that number too high especially considering the expense growth benefited from a stronger us dollar throughout the year on a constant currency basis expense growth ex notables was approximately while im encouraged by the renewed sense of urgency across the organization over the last few months to better manage our expenses we still have a ways to go on this journey which brings me to our key focus areas for first expenses my leadership team and i are fully committed to bending the cost curve this year that will come from instilling further expense discipline across the firm and from focusing more on profitable new business growth saying no to more things when the economics arent what they should be efficiencies are also going to come from implementing ideas that will make bny mellon a simpler more efficient place to do business with and so here weve embarked on an enterprisewide initiative led by senior leaders and highperforming employees from around the world focused on driving greater efficiency and enabling sustainable growth no one knows the ins and outs of our products services and processes better than our people and so all of our staff have had the opportunity to take an active role in this initiative by submitting ideas for how we can run the company in a better way for all our stakeholders to date weve approved about highquality ideas of which about are already completed and another are on track to be implemented this year with a meaningful amount of these ideas requiring little upfront investment emily will cover this in more detail but as a result of these initiatives and our renewed determination we expect to achieve nearly double the amount of efficiency savings this year compared to what we achieved in any of the recent years but our priorities are of course not just about managing expenses we are also focused on reinvigorating profitable growth our budget commits to achieving positive underlying growth this year across almost all of our businesses with particularly healthy growth coming from asset servicing pershing and treasury services we will continue full speed ahead with our critical longterm growth investments that i mentioned earlier with clear and specific targets that we expect the teams to hit over the course of the year lastly on the top line our priorities include goals for our bny mellon program which incentivizes cross business referrals and development of innovative multibusiness solutions that only bny mellons unique collection of businesses is equipped to provide in we saw good initial momentum and we surpassed our initial goal for the year and we intend to deliver a further pickup in as we increasingly sell our platform and better connect the dots for our clients the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 finally on capital management ill highlight that our board of directors has authorized a new billion share repurchase program which provides us ample flexibility and having ended the year comfortably above our capital management targets were now resuming buybacks and so in summary while none of us can predict exactly what the operating environment will look like in we are laserfocused on growing the franchise and executing against our efficiency plans with discipline and urgency to drive some positive operating leverage in while returning a healthy amount of capital to our shareholders this year with that let me turn it over one last time to emily as our cfo emily h portney chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp thank you robin and good morning everyone as i walk you through the details of our results for the quarter all comparisons will be on a yearoveryear basis unless i specify otherwise starting on page of our financial highlights presentation total revenue of billion in the fourth quarter was down on a reported basis and up excluding notable items as robin mentioned earlier and as you can see at the bottom of the page our reported results in the fourth quarter included a few notable items resulting from actions to improve our revenue and expense trajectory reported revenues included approximately million of net securities losses recorded in investments and other revenue resulting from a previously disclosed repositioning of our securities portfolio which i will expand upon later fee revenue was flat as the benefit of lower money market fee waivers and healthy organic growth across our securities services and market and wealth services segment was offset by the impact of lower market values from both equity and fixed income markets and the unfavorable impact of a stronger us dollar firmwide assets under custody andor administration of trillion declined by the headwind of lower market values and currency translation was tempered by continued growth from both new and existing clients and assets under management of trillion decreased by this also reflects lower market values and the unfavorable impact of the stronger us dollar and again this headwind was partially offset by cumulative net inflows investment and other revenue was negative million in the quarter on a reported basis excluding notable items investment and other revenue was positive million a good result reflecting another quarter of strong fixed income trading performance and net interest revenue increased by primarily reflecting higher interest rates expenses were up or excluding notable items notable items amounted to approximately million in the quarter primarily severance expenses and provision for credit losses was million primarily reflecting changes in the macroeconomic forecast on a reported basis eps was pretax margin was and return on tangible common equity was excluding the impact of notable items eps was up year overyear pretax margin was and return on tangible common equity was touching on the full year on page total revenue grew by on a reported basis and by excluding notable items fee revenue was flat investment and other revenue was negative million or positive million excluding notable items and net interest revenue was up expenses were up on a reported basis and up excluding notable items consistent with our goal to drive expense growth towards the bottom half of the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 the to range that we guided to throughout the year excluding the benefit from the stronger us dollar expenses exnotables for the year were up provision for credit losses was million compared to a provision benefit of approximately million in the prior year on a reported basis eps was pretax margin was and return on tangible common equity was excluding the impact of notable items eps was up yearoveryear pretax margin was and return on tangible common equity was on to capital and liquidity on page our consolidated tier leverage ratio was up approximately basis points sequentially primarily reflecting capital generated through earnings the sale of alcentra and an improvement in accumulated other comprehensive income partially offset by capital returned through dividends our cet1 ratio was up approximately basis points driven by the increase in capital and lower risk weighted assets and finally our lcr was up percentage points sequentially turning to our net interest revenue and balance sheet trends on page which i will also talk about in sequential terms net interest revenue of billion was up sequentially this increase primarily reflects higher yields on interestearning assets partially offset by higher funding costs once again nir in the quarter exceeded our expectations as noninterestbearing deposits remain elevated average deposit balances decreased by within this interestbearing deposits increased by and non interest bearing deposits declined by despite this decline in the quarter the share of noninterest bearing deposits as a percentage of total deposits has held up better than expected at which is higher than historical averages and we continue to actively manage our deposit footprint to optimize across nir liquidity value and return on capital average interest earning assets remained flat underneath that cash and reverse repo increased by loan balances were down and our investment securities portfolio was down as i mentioned in the fourth quarter we took actions to reposition the securities portfolio to improve our nir trajectory for the coming years we sold roughly billion of longerdated lower yielding municipal and corporate bonds which weve been replacing with significantly higher yielding securities earning roughly or to basis points more than what we were earning on the securities that we sold while we realized an approximately million pretax loss with this sale this transaction was virtually capital neutral because the unrealized loss was already recognized in aoci in fact we freed up roughly million of cet1 capital as the higher credit quality replacement portfolio consumes significantly lower rwa moving on to expenses on page expenses for the quarter were billion up yearoveryear excluding notable items expenses were up yearoveryear this yearoveryear increase reflects investments net of efficiency savings higher revenuerelated expenses including distribution expenses as well as the impact of inflation partially offset by the benefit of the stronger us dollar turning to page for a closer look at our business segments securities services reported total revenue of billion up compared to the prior year fee revenue increased and net interest revenue was up driven by higher interest rates partially offset by lower balances as i discuss the performance of our securities services and market and wealth services segments i will focus my comments on investment services fees for each line of business which you can find in our financial supplement in asset servicing investment services fees were down as the impact of lower market values and a stronger us dollar were mostly offset by the abatement of money market fee waivers higher client activity and net new business in issuer services investment services fees were up driven by the reduction of money market fee waivers and higher depositary receipts issuance and cancellation fees the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 next market and wealth services on page market and wealth services reported total revenue of billion up fee revenue was up and net interest revenue increased by in pershing investment services fees were up this increase reflects lower money market fee waivers higher fees on sweep balances and higher client activity partially offset by the impact of lost business in the prior year and lower market levels net new assets were billion reflecting a very healthy level of growth from existing clients while flows related to dividends and yearend capital gains distributions were naturally more muted than in the prioryear quarter and average active clearing accounts were up yearonyear in treasury services investment services fees were flat the benefit of lower money market fee waivers and net new business was offset by the negative impact to fees from higher earnings credits on the back of higher interest rates and in clearance and collateral management investment services fees were up primarily reflecting higher us government clearance volumes driven by continued demand for us treasury securities due to elevated volatility amid evolving monetary policy now turning to investment and wealth management on page investment and wealth management reported total revenue of million down fee revenue was down and net interest revenue was up assets under management of trillion declined by yearoveryear this decrease largely reflects lower market values and the unfavorable impact of the stronger us dollar partially offset by cumulative net inflows as it relates to flows in the quarter we saw billion of net outflows from longterm products and billion of net inflows into cash among our longterm active strategies liabilitydriven investments continued to be a bright spot with billion of net inflows in the quarter a real testament to our marketleading capabilities and resilient performance during the recent market dislocation the very healthy net inflows into our cash strategies come on the back of strong investment performance most notably in our dreyfus money market funds in investment management revenue was down due to lower market values and mix of cumulative net inflows through stronger us dollar and the sales of alcentra partially offset by lower money market fee waivers and finally in wealth management revenue was down primarily reflecting lower market values client assets of billion were down yearoveryear primarily driven by lower market values page shows the results of the other segment where investment and other revenue includes the net loss from the repositioning of the securities portfolio and expenses include severance now let me close with a few comments on how were thinking about with regards to nir we have positioned ourselves for another year of healthy growth and so we currently project an approximately year overyear increase for the full year and that assumes current marketimplied interest rates having said that the range of potential outcomes remains relatively wide and the quarterly trajectory of nir will be dependent on various factors including the path of deposit levels and mix as well as interest rates as it relates to fees as you know marketdriven factors like equity and fixed income market levels currency and interest rates dominated fee dynamics in while underlying growth across securities services and market and wealth services was offset by headwinds in investment and wealth management for we expect to return to some underlying fee growth for the firm now robin talked about the work weve been doing over the last few months to bend the cost curve while making sure were continuing to invest for this translates into expenses excluding notable items increasing by approximately assuming exchange rates remain flat to where they ended or by approximately on a constant currency basis this compares to in and then on taxes we expect our effective tax rate for the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 the year to be in the to range primarily due to an increase of the corporation tax rate in the uk this year and finally i want to close with a few remarks on capital management as you saw we ended comfortably above our management target and our board of directors has authorized a new billion share repurchase program which provides us ample flexibility as always the timing and the amount of repurchases is subject to various factors including our capital position and prevailing market conditions among others based on our current expectation for continued earnings growth in combination with our estimated trajectory of aoci pulling to par were now resuming buybacks and would expect to return north of of earnings through dividends and buybacks in with that operator can you please open the line for questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions as a reminder we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related followup question our first question comes from brennan hawken your line is open please go ahead brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my questions first congrats to emily on your new role emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp thank you brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc im sure you wont miss our earnings quarterly but it was real pleasure to work with you here these past few years so id love to drill down on the nii expectations you indicated that it assumes current market rates but maybe you could please walk us through some of the more specific drivers primary assumptions and moving pieces that underlie that growth assumption emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp good morning brennan and its been great to work with all of you as well so as you think about the nir outlook the first thing i would just mention is that we use the forward curves to as a basis of our projection so we dont try to get cute and then all of you know for the fed that assumes another basis points of hikes in the first quarter probably followed by a pause till the end of the year that the curves in outside the us assume about to basis points worth of hikes by both the boe and the ecb so as a result of these curves and rising rates as well as i would say all of the actions that weve taken in the securities portfolio and by that i dont just mean the rebalancing that we did in december but we obviously the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 positioned the portfolio throughout the year meaningfully shortening duration adding floaters et cetera so with all of that we do continue to expect to benefit from significantly higher reinvestment yields now tempering that a bit we do expect deposits to decline modestly call it low to midsingle digits from fourth quarter average and finally as it relates to marginal betas we would expect them to continue to increase but of course more so for nondollar balances so thats really whats behind the guide yearonyear but i would also say there is a lot of uncertainty in the market and certainly were prepared for many different outcomes it will be highly dependent upon deposit levels and theres some upside there if we retain more nibs brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc great thats very helpful thank you emily capital accretion was really encouraging this quarter you guys have the rather large buyback announced and you made some positive comments on it in your prepared remarks emily aoci was really i think the source of the big surprise from my perspective how should we be thinking about aoci accretion if yields remained stable from here what does that timeline look like emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure so assuming the portfolio doesnt change and forward rates are realized our latest forecast would expect to recover probably close to of the billion of unrealized loss in the afs portfolio over the course of call it to months brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay excellent thank you very much operator our next question comes from alex blostein your line is open please go ahead alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning everybody and emily congrats again i was hoping that we could start with a question around fixed income markets theres generally a broad set of bullishness on the outlook for fixed income flows particularly with respect to etfs im curious as a very large servicer of fixed income assets and you guys just kind of touch that whole ecosystem in multiple different ways can you help us frame how bks fees overall and servicing fees specifically could benefit from an improved outlook from fixed income flows both mutual funds and etfs is there a particular difference when its like inflows versus outflows just hoping to get a little more granularity as we think about the fee outlook for emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure so just as we think about the fee outlook what i would say is just our base case assumption is that theres a relatively soft landing in the us so that would mean average equity markets as well as fixed income markets are not that far off from what weve seen in averages in you are correct that our money market platform does benefit that to a degree having said that we do expect some modest runoff in balances as well in money market funds and what i would also just highlight is that any strength in the fixed income markets really does play to the strength of our investment management business the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah alex its robin i would just add a couple of things to that just as you think across the breadth of our franchise and emily mentioned a couple of them we have a lot of oars in the water on fixed income generally so our asset servicing business is fixed income heavy that gives rise to a fixed income heavy securities lending business we have our trillion worth of cash on our investment platform so that plays in the short end of the market which obviously has an overlap with fixed income as well we have our dreyfus money market fund which has performed really quite well over the course of the year in terms of performance and asset gathering we have our treasury business in terms of our clearance business we have our treasury market repo business so weve got a lot of different opportunities that come from all of this and were obviously paying attention to all of them alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got you great thanks and then maybe just my followup on operating leverage in the business broadly you mentioned robin a number of different efficiency programs that you have in place that sound like theyre ramping nicely and its kind of incorporated in your expense guidance for this year but when you sort of take a step back and assuming that shortterm interest rates remain sort of rangebound or whatever the forward curve is forecasting how are you thinking about the pretax margin for the firm as a whole over time im not sure if youre ready to talk about those targets yet but in the past you guys were north of is that ultimately the goalpost as you think about the ins and outs of your programs but also whats going on in the top line robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp so youre right in that were still working on it im months into my tenure weve talked about the strategy reviews they are ongoing weve made some good progress its true on the business side its also true on the function and the support side as well but we are focused to your question on margin we are focused on driving profitable growth which is top line but with an eye to the bottom line and also just exuding expense discipline through doing the work we think weve got a highperforming culture but we continue to drive on things that relate to that and i think when you look across revenue growth pretax margins and rotce you have the key metrics that were really using now we are considering a variety of different kpis and we look forward to giving you all more transparency on some of those kpis as the year progresses so as we do the work were going to come talk to you about it alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great thank you very much operator our next question comes from brian bedell your line is open sir please go ahead brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks good morning great working with you over the years maybe if you could talk a little bit shifting gears a bit to a scenario in which we dont have a soft landing and lets say we do have a recession and a lot of pressure on markets in that scenario if we assume that there still is actually pretty good allocation to fixed the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 income which of course you would benefit from can we just talk about throughout your platform to what extent you would expect to be resilient against that and some of the areas im thinking of are even in deposits where the deposit growth could outperform the expectations that you described emily and then if you could also just remind us on the fee revenue sensitivity to equity market declines i think its 1plus for every i think emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure so a couple of comments there and i think robin will add on probably so just in terms of our sensitivity overall our fee sensitivity to fixed income markets just remember for every or so gradual change in fixed income markets that impacts annual fee revenue to the tune of about million so that gives you some idea on how to size that and then certainly as robin pointed out earlier we have many different businesses that ultimately would benefit from also strength in fixed income markets robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp but brian let me just add something else one of the things that were a trust bank we often get obviously compared to trust banks and i understand why but we have a broader portfolio that i think is quite relevant in answer to your question particularly and they happen to be higher growth higher margin businesses for us so things like pershing things like treasury services our clearance business our collateral management business and those really do contribute to the underlying diversification that we have as a firm and that portfolio helps us with the stability of underlying revenues through different market conditions because theyre essentially driven by different things and so we get a balance for that now on top of that were of course thinking about how to make sure that we are increasing the mix of the types of revenues that we have as well so yes we have fees yes we have net nir but were also powered by transaction volumes and were also powered by subscription fees and so the combination of these the diversification of the businesses and the diversification of the types of revenue streams we think helps us quite a bit in these different market conditions and thats why youve seen us in fact perform in an effective and relatively stable way through some pretty significant gyrations brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thats great color and then maybe robin if you just want to continue on the growth initiatives that youve outlined pershing x the payments venture with digital payments especially and in terms of these are definitely longterm investments and trajectories but maybe if you can sort of think or sort of telegraph what you think might be the contribution this year or just outline what you think might be a reasonable organic revenue growth rate for this year robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp so look weve talked about the fact that these are mediumterm initiatives and they are the contribution to revenues today from realtime payments is really small but we do see this as rails of the future and we see it as creating an opportunity for a connected set of services think fraud prevention and account validation and bill payrelated things so theres an ecosystem that builds around the actual capability and we think that thats a significant opportunity for us youve seen some announcements that weve made but if i tick through very briefly and i will try to be quick about it but through each of our businesses the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 look in pershing weve had a strong year of net new asset growth we talked about it in my prepared remarks and we think that well have growth in the nearterm through onboarding the pipeline and then weve got the medium play of pershing x in asset servicing weve been growing sales and at the same time were leaning into the future with things like digital assets and were focusing on the expense base as well so again its something for the near term and for the medium term in markets were driving with foreign exchange and liquidity and securities lending and then for the medium term execution services and new products in ccm we expect the evolution that will come from the gradual decant of repo into triparty which we think were well positioned for in treasury services were picking up crossborder activity in terms of us dollar clearing and were playing for the longer term that i talked about with realtime payments and so across so many of our businesses weve got opportunities in the near term were focused on executing them and were investing for later brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thats great color thank you very much operator our next question comes from rob wildhack your line is open please go ahead robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research good morning guys i appreciate the color on deposits for wanted to ask a little bit more about what you saw in the quarter interestbearing deposits flipped to growth wondering what the drivers are there and on the noninterestbearing side that outflow accelerated quarteroverquarter so any more color on either of those would be great thanks emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp so on deposit balances overall for the quarter were down very modestly as you can see and most of that was a runoff in nonoperational but nibs did and still are remaining at elevated levels so just for what its worth when were talking about the trajectory for deposits in as i said before we would expect average deposits to decline very modestly call it lowsingle digits from fourth quarter averages and you should expect and we are expecting the large majority of that to be from nibs because they will probably revert back to about to of our total deposit balances as weve really seen in historical average robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research okay thanks and then robin you highlighted healthy growth in asset servicing as a priority for this year thats a business thats well established sometimes can be more difficult to differentiate so what are the kinds of things you can do and you want to do to accelerate growth there robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp well im going to start off on this one but then im gonna give it over to emily because she is going in to run that business and knows it pretty well already from her prior time but i think there are a variety of different opportunities for us i mentioned in my prepared remarks that were really elevating the conversation more into the the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 csuite of some of these firms because gone really are the days where were selling a small component of a service on an isolated basis we see more opportunities to sell bundled deals with data and digital capabilities all wrapped up in it and that we see we are getting traction from that we had a very significant new client that we announced earlier on in the year or last year that is a good example of that type of package sale so thats one thing we also have the bottom line focus i want to continue to point you at the comments that weve made before that the margin in that business is not acceptable and that we will continue to invest both in the top line well benefit some from rates and investing in making the cost of execution cheaper and more efficient in that business so its really a package of all of the things i dont know emily if you want to add emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah just a few things to add so as robin alluded to in his prepared remarks i mean we are winning larger and highervalue deals but were also very focused on the profitability of the mandate and the relationship overall and so that also means were being more selective even in the rfps that we participate in likewise were leaning into highergrowth areas like alts and etfs of the wins that we have seen or had a data component and data is very critical especially in the forward trajectory to our clients and i would say our pipeline is very strong and the other thing of course as robin mentioned is we are very very focused on driving the cost down across the securities services segment inclusive of asset servicing for those businesses which remain pretty manually intensive so think transfer agency think fund accounting so theres opportunity there for sure robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research thank you very much operator our next question comes from steven chubak your line is open please go ahead steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so im going to ask the question i had asked you months ago roughly on the earnings call about basel iv we still dont have a proposal but we know something is coming in early and given his speech had hinted at capital requirements moving higher for the gsib cohort recognizing there is still no proposal but i was hoping you could just speak to how youre scenario planning for the finalization of basel iii whether that has any influence on the potential cadence of future buybacks or just capital management more broadly how you see that potentially evolving emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure so look were obviously very involved with regulators in the industry around the conversations around basel iv its true of course the introduction of operating or operational risk rwa into the standardized approach would by itself drive an increase in our standardized rwas when we crunch the numbers our calcs suggest something a bit less than probably what youve seen for the gsibs aggregate in the qis the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 and there are also we do also expect there are going to be some offsets for us so lower credit risk rwas and also well probably benefit modestly from the more risksensitive market framework so therell be puts and takes well have to wait really until the regulators release their proposed version and we already and we do obviously for us were always looking at rwa optimization you can actually see that rwas came down in the quarter again from optimization that we have been ongoing thats ongoing and weve been doing and i would just remind you too that the industry will have time to leg into whatever the results end up being steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc fair enough and just for my followup on expenses i was hoping you can help us reconcile what the expense guidance for implies for both the op margin and dollars of expense as it relates to the securities services segment specifically it feels like thats the area where theres still some of the most lowhanging fruit if you will to drive efficiency gains and just given the planned efficiency actions how should we think about that second derivative for expense growth should we expect that to steadily improve over the course of the year where you implement the plan you start to realize some of the benefits and the exit rate on expenses therefore in should reflect a lower level of expense growth relative to the other quarters emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp so ill kind of answer that more focused on margin for securities services because thats really what weve been talking about and is a very critical kpi for us so and i think robin already said we are very committed to a plus percent margin over the medium term youll see we printed in the fourth quarter margin of about for the full year that was closer to in we will benefit somewhat from nir so higher rates will partially offset perhaps by a modest decline in nibs also we are absolutely extraordinarily focused on executing against the revenue growth as well as the efficiency initiatives that we have been talking about when you think about securities services though id also just mention theres going to be some nonrecurring activity that we enjoyed in that we wont have in in issuer services in particular so kind of netnet putting it all together when you look at the margins for securities services overall theyre going to be lower than what we printed in  but certainly higher than the full year level so were making progress steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc and just the expense growth on a firmwide basis whether the exit rate for should reflect some of those additional efficiency benefits that you had cited im just trying to think about the cadence for how we should think about the expense trajectory over the course of the year emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah so im not going to give too much detail on just what we expect quarteronquarter i mean the only thing i would say just and all of you guys know this is that for the first quarter staff expenses are typically a bit higher due to longterm incentive comp associated with retirementeligible employees and of course the actions were taking theyre frontloaded but youll see that over the course of the year so i think i would just go back to we are absolutely bending the cost curve we are expecting to deliver and are very committed to deliver yearonyear growth of about constant currency and again that compares to in the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc helpful color emily thanks for taking my questions operator our next question comes from mike mayo your line is open please go ahead michael mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc good hey robin i think you inherited a tough hand here so i mean bank bny mellon historically has had periods when they do a better job controlling expenses but that typically coincides with periods of slower top line growth but youre starting off here fees were down last year looks like your guide for nii implies thats flat with the fourth quarter so its not so much okay revenues are slow you can control expenses so much theyve already slowed or theyre about to so it just seems like your efficiency savings are going to be tougher and as part of that this predates you robin but when it comes to notable items or onetime items you had some this quarter but if you look over a decade your notable items add up to billion thats almost a years worth of earnings so the real question here is how can you improve your profit margin and your efficiency ratio and squeeze more out of bny mellon when the revenue environment has been tough and you have inflationary pressures i guess how confident are you you can turn this around in terms of the positive operating leverage on a core basis robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp so mike without reflecting on the past in terms of what people have done and how theyve done it ill just say that we acknowledge that the past decade has been disappointing in terms of our companys broad financial performance you can look at some spots on the top line the bottom line expenses you pick your spot but were not comfortable with the broad performance of the company over the past decade and thats how we talk to our board about it thats how we talk to our employees about it and were determined to change that and so youre hearing from us i think i hope a determination around changing that outcome now to your question let me take the two parts of the things that youve really talked about so first of all the notable items and so we are very very clear and we do this in our earnings release and we do it in our prepared remarks we talk gaap first so you can see the reported numbers and its very clear and you can judge us on that but we also want to give you the transparency and frankly the insight into the way that were running the company under the hood and we think thats why that additional element of disclosure is helpful but youll make your judgment based on that transparency and the insights that were trying to provide now i own that to number if you use the exit rate of currency on a constant currency basis and thats essentially half of what it was in and the environment from an inflation point of view isnt expected to get any better we had inflation over the course of the past few months cpi between 6andchange and 9andchange weve still got that environment but weve been very deliberate in terms of staffing choices of things that were going to do choices of how were going to do it i talked to you in my prepared remarks about a variety of involving our employees in bending the cost curve because i think its a cultural thing for us as well were attacking it on all of those fronts now once weve done all of those things to the implied question of what do we think the future holds well we dont want to stop there we dont have line of sight to all of the things that were going to do in the future but we the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 see opportunities for instance im just going to pick one and then ill finish which is on technology weve invested a ton rightly so in resiliency as a company resiliency is incredibly important to our products and services its wrapped up in our brand and we wanted to make sure that we really took ourselves to a better place than where we were five years ago but now weve largely done that its a continuous journey we always have to do stuff but the next leg for us is investing in things like the applications the digitization of our footprint were the worlds largest custodian but weve got more than one custody system weve got multiple loan systems weve got five different call centers and so were going in and seeing all of these opportunities and then over time well do the work to resolve the issues but we cant do it all at once because otherwise wed spike on the expense base in order to solve the problems and we only have finite bandwidth so were working through it and well continue to work through it michael mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah that would be great if you can share more of those metrics over time and how what your targets are the other part of that is your you said you have four growth initiatives you did mention digital assets and post the recent debacle can you put any concrete metrics or put more meat on the bones as far as where youd like to eventually get to or revenues or whats the endgame just something more on this its one of your four key growth initiatives just a little bit more color robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp sure so i just want to make one comment about the four things that i mentioned and that youre quoting those arent the only growth initiatives in the company i pick them out because i think theyre good and representative examples but theyre and theyre different things and they have different timelines associated with them as well but there are other things that i havent mentioned at least havent given great as much prominence to but that could be very interesting to us over time but specifically for digital assets its the longest term play out of any of the things that we talked about i expect it to be negligible from a revenue point of view over the course of the next couple of years it might be negligible for the next five years but as the worlds largest custodian we are in the business of looking after stuff we look after trillion worth of stuff and if theres going to be new stuff to look after we should be in the business of looking after it if the way in which we look after stuff which is the point about the technology changes we have to adapt to that and so were investing for a future that probably will come to be but it may not but if it does come to be we have to be there it would be like being the custodian of years ago and sticking with paper and not adopting a computer thats not going to be us so were investing were being cautious were being deliberate and weve got rd in different parts of the company and its measured but we do think its important for us to participate in the broader digital asset space michael mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp thank you operator our next question comes from gerard cassidy your line is open please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets hi emily hi robin robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp hey gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets emily on the noninterestbearing deposits you mentioned how they are a little higher than normal i think you said of total deposits but you do expect them i think you said to drop to more normal levels to whats keeping them up so high and second could they remain maybe higher for longer this year or do you see some real trends that no theyre definitely going to get back to normal emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp great question and frankly there is a lot of uncertainty around that so look more generally as it relates to nibs we think its theyre high theyre probably elevated because of certainly some riskoff behavior the other thing though that id really mention is that weve gotten a lot more sophisticated too in just how we manage our deposits and the tools with which we manage our deposits so i think theres something to that also as well we do expect the nibs to revert to about to but youre right i mean to the extent they remain elevated that is going to be very helpful and well have upside to our nir projection and look the only other thing id mention is that weve seen significant growth in for example asset servicing corporate trust et cetera which naturally those businesses attract nibs gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets very good we all know that obviously your bank is a feebased bank it is not a bank that any of us are concerned about credit quality but i would just like to get your guys thoughts and you had a small provision increase again nothing material and again i emphasize nobody is really concerned about bank of new yorks credit quality but with the expectation of a soft recession or a slowdown whatever you want to call it are you guys seeing any trends in the loan book that youre just watching maybe a little more closely today than months ago the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp so just as a reminder and i think youve already alluded to it the quality of our portfolio remains very high so weighted average rating of a a investment grade is over npls and delinquencies are stable the only area that of course were monitoring very closely is the cre portion of the portfolio and the office segment in particular at the moment occupancy and rent collections remain high but it is an area that were paying closer attention to gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets and what percentage of that cre of the loan book is that about emily emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp its about of the funded loans gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets great thank you operator our next question comes from ken usdin your line is open please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hi thanks good morning robin i know you talked earlier just about the general view for fees to increase and some thoughts on asset servicing just wondering if you have a view on just what you think organic growth can look like and also its nice to also see some of the movement in the fourth quarter in specifically in pershing and collateral management just wondering if you had a thumbnail on what the outlook for those two areas is as well thank you robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp sure so from an overall fees point of view we are focused on this internal growth forgetting about ma or any of those other ways to grow just the blocking and tackling and execution of what we think we can do in the company over the course of the year we havent given fee guidance because of the reasons that emily alluded to which is there are just so many things going on in the market there are just too many puts and takes for that to be credible for us so that we are but we of course have our internal budget and thats what weve been working through over the course of time look you called out two businesses and those are businesses where we both where we think those are bright spots for growth and so we expect those to be above the average growth of the company theyre not the only ones that would be above the average but they are two that would be and we feel quite good about the prospects for a variety of the different underlying reasons that weve talked about already the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay very good and then just one quick one in terms of that followup on the balance sheet mix emily is there anything changing with regards to how you think about the mix of securities that you add from here in terms of as we get towards the peak of the rate cycle whether you start thinking about putting on more fixed rate versus the floating type and what that means for the types of yields that youre able to get on your kind of front book investments emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure so theres a lot in there so look weve been very nimble and continue to be very nimble in terms of managing our portfolio bottom line right now were positioned to benefit from higher rates but i just call everyones attention to the fact that the duration of our portfolio is the shortest its been in recent memory and more than of the portfolio is in available for sale so weve really retained a lot of flexibility and we can act very swiftly should the environment ultimately change and as it relates to reinvestment yields i guess it was in the second quarter i believe in that reinvestment rates began to exceed rolloff rates the difference between the two has steadily expanded to about basis points in the second sic fourth quarter and when you just think about how much of the portfolio resets at any moment in time about as i said of the securities or you actually can see it of the securities portfolio is floatingrate assets and the duration of the fixed asset securities is about three years you can kind of do the math there ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thats great thanks emily operator and our final question will come from michael brown your line is open please go ahead michael brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you for taking my questions robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp hey mike michael brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc most of them have been answered but yeah hi robin hi emily i guess my question was kind of as we think about further out into and so the market is assuming some rate cuts could occur before yearend as we get if we get to that point what is your view on how deposit pricing performs there right because if your deposit betas were generally higher than the broader banking system on the way up how do we think about it to the point where we start to see some early rate cuts because i guess in that backdrop its not an expectation that were heading back to where we were just some modest rate cuts so how do you think about the deposit pricing in that environment the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure ill take that so we do expect deposit pricing to perform similarly on the way down as it did on the way up so well get the benefit of course because our we will get the benefit should rates suddenly start to come down of deposit costs also coming down very quickly and likewise ill just remind you that to the extent that rates start to come down then aoci will pull to par faster michael brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thank you for that and then just one more on nii appreciate the full year annual guidance as you look at the fourth quarter it was up about sequentially within the annual guidance any view on how we should think about the first quarter i know its a moving target but any range here just to help us think about the trajectory emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah as i mentioned the range of outcomes is very wide so its really hard to predict the trajectory in any given quarter it really is very dependent probably most specifically on the deposit trajectory and like i said if nibs remain elevated theres upside there michael brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thank you for taking my questions operator and with that that does conclude our questionandanswer session for today i would like to hand the call back over to robin for any additional or closing remarks robin vince chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp thank you operator id like to close todays call by thanking emily for her time as our cfo and to congratulate her on taking up her new role starting february as the ceo of asset servicing
