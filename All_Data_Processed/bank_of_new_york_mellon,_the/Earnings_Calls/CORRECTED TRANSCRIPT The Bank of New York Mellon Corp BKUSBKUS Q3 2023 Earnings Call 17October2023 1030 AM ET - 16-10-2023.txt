and continued progress on the steady transformation of our company as you can see on slide of the financial highlights presentation we reported earnings per share of versus in the third quarter of last year excluding notable items which primarily impacted last years results eps of increased by yearoveryear we generated a return on tangible common equity of on billion of revenue up yearoveryear and a pretax margin of in the third quarter the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2023 these results once again highlight the efficacy of our prudent and proactive asset and liability management amid a rapidly evolving operating environment net interest revenue was up yearoveryear as we continued to maximize the positive aspects of rising interest rates our strong liquidity position allowed us to reduce our wholesale funding footprint and despite the significant steepening of the curve unrealized losses in our investment securities portfolio remained well contained our return on tangible common equity together with all of these actions allowed us to continue to deliver attractive capital returns to our shareholders while further strengthening our capital and liquidity ratios to be prepared for a wide range of macroeconomic outcomes as ive just rounded out the first months in my seat id like to take a step back for a moment and reflect on our work todate and where were headed through a series of strategic reviews we have affirmed what we believe to be our key assets number one our client reach and breadth of engagement our toptier clients from all regions of the world both trust and want to do more business with us number two our collection of marketleading businesses were a broadbased financial services company with a balance and diversification that makes us stronger and our unique business mix sets us apart from our competitors and number three our culture of teamwork our people are naturally collegial and seek out opportunities to work together to serve our clients and communities these assets are hard to replicate and its rare that they exist together but as i have acknowledged before the companys longterm financial performance track record hasnt lived up to the quality of this franchise as a result weve committed to drive higher underlying growth consistently deliver positive operating leverage and improve our pretax margin over time as an important mark of clarity and focus to help tie together where we are heading and why we recently communicated three strategic pillars to our employees around the world one be more for our clients two run our company better and three power our culture these three pillars are not fundamentally changing the businesses were in instead they drive at how we operate and who we are daytoday for our clients as ive said before strategy is important but ultimately just a set of words actually doing it and how we do it matters a lot while this was just one quarter in what will be a multiyear transformation im optimistic about the steady improvements we are seeing inside of bny mellon and i want to share with you some of this perspective that gives us confidence that were on the right track with the work that we are doing under each of these pillars first im encouraged by the pace of progress towards making bny mellon a betterrun company our businesses have historically operated largely in silos weve run somewhat like a corporate conglomerate with a holding company that owns a series of vertically selfsufficient subsidiaries this has led to clunky client journeys wasteful duplication and a lack of joinedup thinking we have many opportunities to run our company better and more efficiently to reduce bureaucracy and we need to be smart and disciplined with how we spend so our investments in the business go further the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2023 ive talked to you before about our efficiency initiative comprising about ideas developed by those who often see items ripe for improvement most clearly and closely our people this program internally we call it project catalyst is well underway and we started to see some early benefits in our financial results as you may recall in january we set out to essentially halve our expense growth rate this year to roughly growth excluding notable items compared to roughly excurrency in we have made good progress against this goal with less than three months left in the year we are confident that we will outperform our expense growth target for all while selffunding over billion of incremental investments this year as weve started the budgeting process for we are determined to bend the cost curve further were now working to adopt a platforms operating model which will help us to do things in one place do them well and elevate overall execution and were embracing new technologies so we can be more productive more efficient and focus on growth automation of processes and investment in operations digitization and ai across the firm will make it easier for our employees to do their jobs and subsequently channel their energies toward new innovations which brings me to our work toward being more for our clients our financial results in the quarter tell a tale of two cities against the backdrop of seasonally slower summer months we once again saw outperformance in some of our differentiating businesses strength in clearance and collateral management continued and we saw healthy underlying growth in pershing as well as solid momentum in asset servicing this was offset by continued softness in investment management fees and lower foreign exchange revenue given the subdued market backdrop our path to higher underlying growth is clear in addition to always being on the hunt for new clients we have to deliver more to our existing clients develop new products and do a better job at connecting the adjacent ones our new chief commercial officer has hit the ground running as we start operationalizing 1bny mellon across the organization to sharpen our commercial focus and elevate the client experience across the firm at the same time were pushing forward with innovative new client solutions that leverage the adjacencies among our businesses while still early days initial client wins with our recently launched solutions as well as the quality of our pipelines are encouraging pershing xs new openarchitecture wealth management platform wove is off to a promising start including a couple of client agreements already signed several prospective clients in active contracting and a steadily growing pipeline as an example integrity a nationwide insurance and financial services firm with a network of over million agents and advisors has selected our wove platform to support their wealth management business with wove we are also connecting solutions from across bny mellon for example integrity will have access to thirdparty models and institutionalgrade solutions from our specialist firms in investment management and brokerdealer clearing and custody solutions through pershing in another example pershing expanded their longstanding relationship with lincoln investment as the company transitions their selfclearing business onto pershings custodial platform and selected wove to provide a suite of technology solutions to its financial professionals as we onboard additional clients through the remainder of we are planning to start disclosing relevant financial information and leading indicators for you all to keep track of woves growth trajectory at the beginning of the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2023 next year we also signed the first external client a leading gsibowned european asset manager for our recently launched buyside trading solutions without a doubt we expect our more prominent solutions like wove and buyside trading to move the needle on growth over time but we are leaning into innovation to solve the evolving client challenges across all of our businesses for example in treasury services we were one of the first banks to go live on fednow the federal reserves new instant payment rail this allows us to expand our capabilities for corporations nonbank financial institutions and fintechs and as a service provider we are helping our financial institutions clients access instant payments remain competitive and provide bestinclass service for their customers as another example this quarter the business announced the launch of bankify an openbanking payment solution that as an alternative to credit or debit cards and thirdparty payment platforms helps organizations receive consumer payments from bank accounts with a seamless user experience and guaranteed settlement let me conclude by saying that we are optimistic about the opportunity in front of us and our strategic objectives for the short medium and long term are clear we are innovating and pushing forward on our multiyear growth investments all the while remaining disciplined to deliver positive operating leverage and pretax margin expansion as ive said all along the path to transforming bny mellon into a consistently highperforming company will take some time but for we are on track to deliver what we said wed deliver at the beginning of the year while making steady progress toward our strategic priorities im proud and appreciative of our peoples dedication to be more for our clients run our company better and power our culture collectively to unlock bny mellons potential with that over to you dermot dermot william mcdonogh chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp thank you robin and good morning everyone i will start on page of the presentation with our consolidated financial results for the third quarter total revenue of billion was up yearoveryear net interest revenue was up yearoveryear primarily driven by higher interest rates partially offset by changes in balance sheet size and mix fee revenue was flat growth on the back of higher market values net new business and the favorable impact of a weaker dollar was offset by the alcentra divestiture in the fourth quarter last year lower foreign exchange revenue and the mix of aum flows firmwide assets under custodyadministration of trillion were up yearoveryear reflecting higher market values client inflows the weaker dollar and net new business assets under management of trillion were up yearoveryear reflecting the weaker dollar and higher market values partially offset by the alcentra divestiture investment and other revenue was million in the quarter reflecting continued strength in fixed income trading expenses were down yearoveryear on a reported basis primarily reflecting the goodwill impairment associated with our investment management reporting unit in the third quarter last year excluding notable items expenses were up yearoveryear provision for credit losses remained low at million in the quarter as the the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2023 impact of reserve builds to reflect continued uncertainty on the outlook for commercial real estate was largely offset by reserve releases related to financial institutions as robin noted earlier reported earnings per share were excluding notable items earnings per share were representing growth yearoveryear we delivered positive operating leverage our pretax margin was and we generated a return on tangible common equity of turning to capital and liquidity on page consistent with the prior quarter we returned million of capital to our shareholders through common share repurchases and we paid approximately million of dividends to our common stockholders reflecting our previously announced dividend increase which became effective in the third quarter taken together we returned of earnings to shareholders in the quarter or on a yearto date basis our tier leverage ratio improved sequentially by approximately basis points to reflecting a decrease in average assets and increase in tier capital driven by capital generated through earnings net of capital returned through buybacks and dividends unrealized losses related to availableforsale securities remained roughly unchanged in the quarter the cet1 ratio was representing an approximately 30basispoint improvement compared with the prior quarter reflecting lower riskweighted assets and an increase in cet1 capital just like our regulatory capital ratios our liquidity ratios further strengthened in the quarter the consolidated liquidity coverage ratio was a 1percentagepoint improvement compared with the prior quarter and our consolidated net stable funding ratio was well in excess of the regulatory requirement next on page net interest revenue and further details on the underlying balance sheet trends which i will describe in sequential terms net interest revenue of billion was down quarteroverquarter driven by changes in balance sheet size and mix partially offset by higher interest rates as we expected temporary deposits related to the debt ceiling impasse in the second quarter left in july and along with seasonally low balances in august average deposits for the quarter decreased by sequentially in line with our expectations interestbearing deposits were down and noninterestbearing deposits were down you will remember from prior earnings calls that we expected noninterestbearing deposits to moderate to approximately of total deposits in the second half of this year which is consistent with our deposit mix in the third quarter following seasonal troughs in august we saw the anticipated pickup in monthly average balances in september and again some modest growth in the first two weeks of october average interest earning assets were down by quarteroverquarter this reflects a reduction in cash and reverse repo by while we actively reduced wholesale funding our investment securities portfolio was down and loan balances were up moving to expenses on page expenses for the quarter were down yearoveryear on a reported basis and up excluding notable items this yearoveryear increase was driven by higher investments and revenue related expenses the unfavorable impact of the weaker dollar as well as inflation partially offset by efficiency savings and the alcentra divestiture ill talk more about our outlook for expenses in a moment but as robin mentioned earlier it is worth highlighting that for we are expecting to fully selffund over billion of incremental investments through efficiency savings the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2023 turning to our business segments starting with securities services on page as i discuss the performance of our securities services and market and wealth services segments i will comment on the investment services fees for each line of business described in our earnings press release and the financial supplement securities services reported total revenue of billion up yearoveryear fee revenue was flat growth in investment services fees was offset by a decline in foreign exchange revenue on the back of lower volatility and volumes net interest revenue was up in asset servicing investment services fees were up driven by higher market values healthy net new business and the weaker dollar partially offset by lower client transaction activity the strength of our balance sheet as well as the stability breadth and depth of our solutions remain clear differentiators that position us well with clients confronted with a persistently challenging market environment and an evolving competitive landscape for example etf assets under custodyadministration were up over yearoveryear and the number of funds serviced on our platform continue to grow at a healthy clip in alts assets under custodyadministration and related investment services fees both grew in the midsingledigit percentage range despite the number of fund launches having slowed significantly over the past year within issuer services investment services fees were down growth from net new business in corporate trust was more than offset by the absence of fees from elevated depositary receipts cancelation activity in the third quarter of last year next market and wealth services on page market and wealth services reported total revenue of billion up yearoveryear fee revenue was up and net interest revenue increased by in pershing investment services fees were up reflecting higher fees on sweep balances partially offset by the impact of lost business and lower transaction volumes consistent with the decline in us equity exchange volumes despite the continued headwind from the ongoing deconversion of the regional bank client highlighted in the second quarter pershing saw billion of net new assets on the platform this quarter reflecting positive momentum in the underlying business as robin mentioned earlier the momentum around wove is building with both new and existing clients while at the same time ongoing investments in the core pershing platform to enhance advisor experience and lead with innovative solutions have positioned us well to capitalize on the heightened pace of change in the ria community in treasury services investment services fees decreased by as growth from higher client activity was offset by higher earnings credits for noninterest bearing deposit balances in clearance and collateral management investment services fees were up reflecting broadbased growth across us and international clearance and collateral management in particular we saw strength in domestic clearance volumes reflecting elevated volatility and us treasury issuance activity and continued migration from the feds reverse repo facility to traditional triparty collateral management balances recent macro trends including heightened volatility uncertainty associated with monetary policy and banks regulatory capital requirements as well as the recent consolidation in the banking sector further reinforce the value of our triparty collateral management service in addition to expanding our platform both in the us and internationally we continue to innovate new solutions for our clients to better utilize their collateral the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2023 turning to investment and wealth management on page investment and wealth management reported total revenue of million down yearoveryear fee revenue was down and net interest revenue declined yearoveryear assets under management of trillion increased by yearoveryear as i mentioned earlier this increase reflects the weaker dollar and higher market values partially offset by the alcentra divestiture in the quarter we saw billion of net outflows from longterm strategies driven by client derisking and rebalancing and billion of net inflows into shortterm strategies led by our dreyfus money market fund complex in investment management revenue was down yearoveryear primarily reflecting the alcentra divestiture and the mix of aum flows partially offset by higher performance fees as well as the impact of higher market values and the weaker dollar in our wealth management business revenue decreased by driven by lower net interest revenue and changes in product mix partially offset by higher market values client assets of billion increased by yearoveryear reflecting higher equity market values and cumulative net inflows page shows the results of the other segment i will close with our current outlook for the rest of the year based on marketimplied forward interest rates at the end of last month our net interest revenue outlook for the fullyear remains unchanged for growth year overyear moving to expenses we are making good progress on bending the cost curve while protecting our important investments to accelerate growth and deliver superior client experiences where we sit today i am confident that we will outperform the target of expense growth excluding notable items that we communicated in january and we remain determined to drive that growth rate down to for the fullyear this reflects our expectation for a sequential stepup in expenses excluding notable items in the fourth quarter with seasonally higher business development expenses as well as discrete increases for professional services and occupancy and finally we expect to continue stock buybacks at a pace consistent with the second and third quarter this is in line with our fullyear outlook to return of earnings or more to shareholders over the course of while maintaining our strong capital ratios mindful of the significant uncertainties relating to the operating environment in conclusion our financial results this quarter highlight the effectiveness of our balance sheet management and tangible progress on our journey towards higher operational efficiency and scalability while we have more work to do our teams around the world are embracing change and our pace of bringing innovative new client solutions to the market gives us confidence that revenue growth will follow over time with that operator can you please open the line for qa the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2023 question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of steven chubak with wolfe research please go ahead steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hey good morning robin vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp good morning steven steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc i wanted to start off with a question on the nii outlook i was hoping you could just give some thoughts on the deposit trajectory if rates are higher for longer and the fed continues to engage in qt and given were at that lower bound for nibs where you expect that to ultimately settle out as a percentage of deposits dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure steven ill take that and good morning so i guess the way id like to answer the question is just start with january where we gave the guidance to the market of nii growth for the year and weve been consistent with that on the call since then and we reconfirmed that guidance today for for the full year now the world has played a different hand to us over the course of the year since january we had the bank turmoil in march and we had the debt ceiling impasse over the summer and clients use us as the ports in the storm during that time and we saw surges in deposits and so that benefited us now over the course of the summer we see those deposits leave and we feel weve reached an inflection point of puts and takes between the natural organic flow versus our surge deposits leaving so we feel the pace of decline has slowed we feel like we hit the trough in august and weve seen modest pickup in deposits in september and into october so overall that and when you take the asset side of the balance sheet and how liquid we are on the asset side and how thats rolling down you might want to know that as the balance sheet continues to roll down we have a yield pickup of to basis points which gives us a lot of confidence in our estimate for the year and outlook into as it relates to nibs we always said that it was going to be to through the cycle the trough happened during the summer months and has stayed in the zip code so we feel overall pretty good about nibs as a percentage of total deposits being in the range steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc very helpful and just for my followup on the expense outlook youve spoken about the commitment to improve operating margins you cited a number of efforts robin to deliver efficiencies across the platform as we look out the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2023 to next year given a lower nii exit rate relative to the first half for you and for some of your industry peers wanted to get a sense as to how much flexibility is embedded in your expense plans and your ability to drive expenses lower potentially in a more challenging revenue backdrop dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp steven ill start so look weve said on every call this year that bending the cost curve is a very important strategic objective for the firm and were attacking structural expenses in a number of different ways and thats just continuous execution day in day out blocking and tackling the result of all that blocking and tackling has caused us to outperform the guidance that we gave in january and were determined to push that number to closer to while we dont believe the work is over this year and were now in the middle of budget season and we are determined to bend the cost curve into next year and to continue to deliver that positive operating leverage and we kind of go at it in a number of different ways rationalizing vendors rationalizing locations remixing our head count and how we hire this year was our biggest campus class ever double last year and well continue to build on that so there are a lot of things happening underneath the hood that give us a high degree of confidence that well be able to continue to bend the cost curve into and beyond steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc very helpful dermot thanks so much for taking my questions operator our next question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities good morning robin vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities just maybe following up on the discussion around deposits i think dermot you used the word trough multiple times just give us a sense of i mean obviously youve called it right this year in terms of how things have played out but just give us a sense of is it about the mix or the granularity of your deposits or the client behavior that youve seen that gives you confidence that theres of what you saw in august towards the trough and if we are in a period through next year where there are no rate cuts its higher for longer like where does the negative surprise come from if any dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2023 thanks for the question so look this has been a journey for the last months we took a view at the beginning of last year that the fed was going to hike quite significantly and we positioned the balance sheet in a way to do that and so when we talk about deposits i think its very important to look at both sides of the balance sheet at the same time in terms of how were positioned on the asset side we have a lot of the balance sheet in cash which benefits from the higher interest rates our fixed rate securities are going to roll down over the next a decent amount of the fixed securities i think its a quarter a year roll down over the next couple of years and that gets us a pickup of to basis points and at the beginning of the year we did forecast a kind of midsingledigit decline in deposits and that kind of bottomsup analysis and also its important to remember that clients of bny mellon are not just with us for deposits they come into our ecosystem and just remember its a trillion cash ecosystem that we have and they come in for a variety of different reasons its a portfolio of businesses that give us our deposit makeup so when we look at it at a portfolio level we get a lot of confidence around the stability of the deposit base and look there were a lot of gives and takes this year through the bank turmoil in march and the debt ceiling impasse which benefited us and thats kind of moderated and those deposits have left for higheryielding opportunities but we feel like the summer slowdown the seasonal slowdown that we experienced in august and the conversations that we have and talking to our deposit team we feel very good about where we are on the deposit balance now and the pickup thats happened in september and october and that kind of gives us the confidence to say here today that nii is a good number which i think should be good for you guys to know that weve been consistent in our approach over the whole year ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities thats helpful thank you and i guess maybe if i heard you correctly i think you mentioned billion of investments are selffunded thats about of your expense base is that billion im just wondering the relevance of that number is that something that we should think about is it goforward sort of incremental investment spend that you need to selffund through efficiencies as we from the outside try to figure out what expense growth could look like next year just if you could contextualize that billion in investments and what that means going forward dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp so the way i think about that and the message that i would like to give you is it gives a message of discipline in that weve halved the growth rate were going towards and within that growth weve had the financial discipline to be able to selffund billion of investments that we are confident that will deliver further efficiency in years ahead and revenue opportunities so its both kind of powering the top line and automating and driving further efficiency and we look to continue to do that into the budget season this year and next year and this year we doubled the efficiency saves that we have typically achieved in past years and thats both bottoms up i think we both have mentioned this in our prepared remarks the catalyst project that were roughly the way through and were doing real work day in day out that is driving that expense growth down and is delivering opportunities for us that we will harvest in the quarters to come robin vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2023 ebrahim id add just a couple of things to that one weve been very deliberate about not cutting our way to glory but rather working at the problem at a pretty fundamental level so that we can both manage our expenses for the necessary operating leverage which we want to achieve but also sowing the seeds for future efficiencies and future fee growth and so thats really the way in which were thinking about it ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities got it thank you both operator our next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks good morning just one more followup so yes its great to see the for the year reiterated and obviously as discussed that implies a lower fourth quarter exit but i want to more importantly understand the moving parts from there and at what point can you see that stability going forward in terms of some of the things on the front book side helping versus where deposit costs could continue to go up just trying to understand if were at a stable ddas can you see a path to early next year to get that nii point near stable and just let me start there dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp so i dont really want to give guidance for next year today ken we will do that in january i got a lot of questions about that at barclays as well so i feel good about the i feel good about the deposit pipeline that we have weve talked on previous earning calls about our strategic pivot a couple of years ago where we centralized all our deposit businesses in one area and so i feel very good about how were managing the deposits how were pricing the deposits were a little bit different to other institutions in that we have our clients are sophisticated so cumulative betas are not materially changed from last quarter theyre in the zip code and we pass on the rates so i think its important to note that theres no material pricing lag to catch up here and so we feel the absolute level of deposits is pretty good we feel very good about our outlook for the rest of the year but look the world is very uncertain and who knows what comes tomorrow and for well give you more detailed guidance in january but i feel pretty good about where we are today robin vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yes and ken id just add to that just to draw your attention to really emphasize two things number one is when we started off the year and we gave the guidance of for nii growth over the course of the year clearly the year has turned out differently but i think the power of the global liquidity solutions team that weve put together has really been able to prove our ability to be agile in this space a little bit irrespective of the environment i dont want to be complacent with that comment because clearly the world can change but we saw a lot of things over the course of the first three quarters of the year i think the teams done a very good job adapting to those and maintaining the consistency the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2023 and youll remember dermots comments earlier in the year which is we thought nibs were hanging in a little higher than we would have expected them to be and weve always expected them essentially to come down to this level it just happened a little later than we thought but obviously weve been fine with that and then the second comment is remembering the inputs in terms of the diversification dermot said it earlier but it really is critical to our deposits franchise weve got the issuer services business with corporate trust which drives on one set of inputs to their deposit algorithm weve got a clearing and collateral management business which has a different set of drivers weve got our treasury services business which has yet a different set of drivers and of course we have our asset servicing business as well so that breadth and diversification just creates four different outcomes and i think youve seen that over the course of this year so were not sitting here today giving guidance for next year but the fourth quarter nii is probably a pretty decent place to start if you think about the world ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it thank you and just one question on pershing its great to see the wove start and the good commentary you have about the momentum just wondering we know that there was going to be a client deconversion coming out of that as well did we see that in the third quarter result or is that still a pending yet to happen dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp so we expect that to happen over several quarters ken i think the important point so it happened over both quarters i think second quarter was a little bit more than the third quarter but we do expect that to work its way through over the next several quarters i think the important point id leave you with on pershing in addition to the wove development is the fact that we added billion of net new assets in the quarter and the underlying strength of the business and our ability to provide solutions to our clients in that space is really really terrific to see ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah and thats what im hoping for that you can offset that with the organic growth thats what im getting at dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah we believe we have the confidence to earn our way out of that over the next several quarters ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it thank you operator our next question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities please go ahead the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2023 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi i think you guys have been pushing for stronger fee growth and thats a slog but meantime youre certainly bending the cost curve as you say i guess robin to your opening comments about a conglomerate with a bunch of silos and breaking those down certainly is a key to growing revenue faster how can you actually implement horizontal integration among these disparate businesses by breaking down their silos like do you have any proof points or evidence now or is this more like a three to fiveyear plan robin vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp sure mike so look this approach of desiloing the company is clearly one of our critical pillars and weve put that under the heading of run the company better in terms of our internal conversations and so there are many things that were doing were really looking at what is it that we do across the company where we have like capabilities so we have some examples of that on the business side a recent example is we had institutional clearing and settlement that we actually did in our pershing business but we also have an institutional clearing product in our clearance and collateral management business so weve moved the piece from pershing into our clearance and collateral management business so now its all together and i could give you five other examples that are just like that of us rearranging pieces on the business frontend inside the company to be able to be more joined up in terms of how we approach clients and so that is essentially truly making sure that we have consistent clientfacing platforms in terms of how were doing business then on the supporting side of the organization and if you think about our company a little bit like a platforms business we have all these worldleading platforms the largest security lending company in the world the largest collateral manager the largest asset servicing custodian with auc et cetera et cetera what we hadnt done is adapted the way we run the company to actually look like that so weve decided to adopt this more platformslike operating model where were taking things that we in terms of the support that we provide for our businesses and reducing that duplication so ill give you an example on the call center side we used to have seven call centers those seven call centers were each essentially providing a service to their respective businesses now were moving at the beginning but moving towards a single consistent contact center that can provide the service to all seven of those businesses and frankly do it in a better cheaper way which is providing more capability to our clients even note the difference in the word call center versus contact center because theres a client benefit associated with that so look were at the beginning of this thing but we think a platforms operating model is very fit for purpose for our company and it should really simplify how we work improve the client experience and employ our own employees and weve got other proof points we talked about deposits dermot was describing the better outcomes that we think weve had as a result of implementing global liquidity solutions that is a consistent deposit approach across the company weve got kyc as an example as well we used to do kyc in each of our businesses were bringing that together to have a kyc platform so there are a lot of proof points that weve got in various stages of development here in addition to the actual pilots that we did specifically for a platforms operating model the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2023 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc so when you add it all together you said next year you expect to have positive operating leverage is that in aggregate or positive fee operating leverage and how can you have such confidence at this stage robin vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp so look were committed to positive operating leverage over time and i dont want my second year as ceo to be one where we have negative operating leverage so we are focused on positive operating leverage next year thats aggregate operating leverage to answer your question and one of the reasons why we have confidence in that is because weve been investing on both the revenue side and on the expense side in the short medium and longterm perspective dermot just went through a few things that weve done specifically for but the platforms conversation and the answer i just gave to you thats an investment in medium and longterm efficiencies and we havent seen any of the benefit of that really yet and the same thing is true on the revenue side some of the shorterterm things that weve done the enthusiasm around 1bny mellon the referrals that weve had across the business weve talked about that in prior quarters but now were moving to the medium and longerterm benefits which are really getting the benefit of our chief commercial officer and her approach to operationalizing 1bny mellon thats a more mediumterm opportunity and then long term really harnessing the benefits of these product investments that weve made with things like wove and buyside trading so weve been seeding on the revenue side and the expense side short medium and long term as we try to manage for this operating leverage over time mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you robin vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thank you operator our next question comes from the line of alex blostein with goldman sachs please go ahead alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hi good morning guys thanks for the question maybe shift gears a little bit i was hoping to spend a minute on capital nice to see the capital ratios build over the course of the quarter so i guess as youre thinking on the buyback on a forward basis given that its been a little bit lighter over the last couple quarters how are you thinking about that over the next months and maybe just a reminder in terms of how much capital do you expect to accrete back to capital ratios from securities maturing over the next call it six quarters or so dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2023 so ill take that one alex and good morning so i would say for the next quarter no really change in the buyback its going to be consistent with the last couple of quarters going back to one of the three things that we said in january buybacks was one of those and we committed to buying back or more of earnings returning or more of earnings to our shareholders over the course of the year and were on track to do that i would say as we look out in the world today its very different to where it was in january you still have the huge volatility in the rate environment it was basis points in  the geopolitics are very uncertain at the moment and then last but not least youve got basel iii and advocacy and whats going to happen there so there are a lot of things to be worried about and at this stage wed rather be on the cautious end of things and see no real need to change our stance on buybacks in the short term as it relates to your specific question we have about billion of unrealized losses in our afs portfolio and we expect about half of that to come back into capital over the next months so from where we sit here today we continue to build capital we feel very good about our capital position ratios are healthy liquidity is healthy and at the right time well communicate a change in stance on that but for now steady as she goes alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great thanks for that and then theres one business that i was hoping to kind of double click into which is clearance and collateral management weve seen really good growth there for the last several quarters now i think its up yeartodate versus last year can you maybe help us unpack some of the sources of that growth between whats been really market and maybe somewhat elevated volumes given everything thats been going on in treasurys versus more baseline growth in that business as were thinking about building off of this baseline thanks dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp so look ccm clearance and collateral management very big business for us i would say a couple of things a lot of volatility in the market this year significant volumes lots of treasury issuance all of that helps that business i think we continue to innovate as well internationally and so we spend a lot of time on the road with clients overseas because of our strength in the us we feel that we have a lot of value to add in the international space and so we look to build our international business from here i think in the medium term we still see that business continuing to grow given the level of treasury issuance and whats happening in the market so we feel good about the underlying growth also a lot of people might think of it as a kind of steady eddie type business but i have to say the amount of innovation that we do under the hood in terms of serving our clients needs with new solutions and how they can optimize their respective balance sheets and fund it on our platform is very very pleasing to see so we feel very good about the state of the business and the trajectory from here alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc all right thanks very much the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2023 robin vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thank you operator our next question comes from the line of brennan hawken with ubs please go ahead brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thank you for taking my questions id love to start on pershing im curious if you could maybe give a little color on what drove the strength in pershing revenues i know you flagged higher fees on sweep balances but were seeing other wealth management firms flagging headwinds there so curious about whether or not you can provide some color on that and whats driving the resilience for pershing and then i know that its going to be several quarters before we see the decommissioning that you referenced any sense you can give for size of that headwind that we should expect thanks dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp so on the last question first we dont really give specific guidance on the deconversions but look as i said on an earlier question we feel the underlying strength of the business youre always going to take your lumps and things that happen that you wouldnt expect to happen and we feel we have the ability and the confidence and the people and the strategy and the products to earn our way out of that so pershing is a very its a very strong business for us its in our most profitable segment markets and wealth solutions sic services and we feel very good about the margin of that segment and of pershing in particular just kind of doubleclicking on your original question there are many things that make up the fees that are coming into pershing theyre transactional which is correlated to us exchange volumes assetbased based on equity market levels and balancebased and so again when you take the portfolio approach that we have with our business and the different composition of the fees and then the amount of clients that were onboarding that leads you to a nice good fee outcome for the business overall and so look pershing is marketleading were number one with brokerdealers were very important to the ria community we have a lot of excitement in the marketplace around our wove product and so we have thats attracting new clients to our system as well as existing clients who are excited about that product and that gives us belief that by adding to our existing platform new products well be able to be a more meaningful player than we are today robin vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp and brennan ill just add one thing you used the term underlying momentum i think and its very true in the business if wed been on this call maybe a year ago someone would probably have asked me did i think that we could compete with the selfclearing changes that were going i remember we had these conversations about the puts and takes of the various different flows in the market this quarter we announced lincoln who was selfclearing joining our platform because they just see the benefits of the economies of scale that we can provide the capabilities that we have the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2023 and then of course with an eye to wove and the opportunity to be able to really provide that advisor set of solutions in the same way as the classic pershing platform the investor set of solutions so we feel quite good about the feedback that were getting and remember as well that we have this relatively unconflicted business model in terms of the fact that were not running our own large ria sales force next to our business and we think that some of our clients really appreciate that brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc yes thats all very helpful color thank you for that and then id like to ask a followup question on the noninterestbearing so you flagged that there was some growth quartertodate is it possible to quantify or give us a rough idea about what kind of growth wed be talking about and are you also seeing corresponding growth in the overall deposit base along with the trend in the nibs thanks dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp so i think i used the word modest in my prepared remarks for september off the seasonal lows and i also used the word inflection point with the puts and takes between the level of activity as a result of march and the debt ceiling impasse we feel weve reached a more natural level for deposits and if you go back to the remarks in january we went decline in the deposit base of midsingle digits from where we were at the beginning of the year and so thats really largely how its played out with albeit a different zigzag to what we thought was going to be at the beginning of the year and look the important thing to walk away from the call with is we feel confident with the outlook and the guidance that were giving today of and thats made up of a ton of different factors both on the deposit side and on the repricing on the asset side so we think of the two as very joined up and interlinked and dont really want to get into specific numbers but we feel pretty good about where were at brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay and are those trends applying to both the broad deposit base as well as the nibs just dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah i think its fair to say that yeah brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc great excellent thank you robin vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thank you operator our next question comes from the line of rob wildhack with autonomous research please go ahead the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2023 robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research us lp morning guys i appreciate the update on the strategic priorities im curious on the do more for clients front how is the progress youve made and are making there manifested itself so far are you seeing an uptick in organic growth new business wins anything like that and then the obvious followon from there is when do you think that we could expect to see that progress manifest itself and whether you see revenue growth or operating leverage more broadly thanks robin vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah its an important question rob so the way that we have laid out be more for our clients internally is in a few different threads so the first is delivering more to existing clients and youve heard from us before on this so many of our clients have a single business relationship with us a single product single solution and so we just have the opportunity frankly to have them be able to do more things with us by connecting the dots and offering more to our current clients ill give you a stylized example so if youre an asset servicing client today you probably do some securities lending with us you may or may not do some foreign exchange with us if you do those two products with us why wouldnt you do some margin segregation with us if you do margin segregation with us youre in our collateral ecosystem why wouldnt you do more collateral management with us if youre in that ecosystem youre starting to touch the cash ecosystem and so why wouldnt you also be open to some of the cash liquidityrelated solutions we have and if youre touching that youre adjacent to treasury services and so why wouldnt you also be interested in some of our treasury services products and so thats exactly the fact that we havent done that is the ultimate manifestation of the problem with silos for a company like ours because our businesses are pretty adjacent to each other so that is a very important focus it is the top priority of our new chief commercial officer to really drive the operationalization of making all of that a reality as opposed to just a sort of an internal call to action in the company the second thread is developing new products and connecting adjacent products different than the first example so the two things which are inextricably related to each other could potentially be sold as a solution if you look elsewhere in the technology industry there are often multiple pieces of software that are bundled into one aggregate solution which is actually what clients buy we havent done as much of that because our products have been strewn across the company in their respective silos so by being able to look more horizontally we get to be able to gather up the products and think about the world a little bit more along the lines of solutions and youve seen us do that with some of our asset servicing clients more recently where weve done these bigger more bundled deals and there are more opportunities for that and then the third opportunity is to just win more market share and brand new clients now to be fair we do know a lot of the clients that are out there in the world 90plus of fortune companies of global banks so thats not the biggest opportunity of all of them but we want to be in the hunting business as well and so well go find those clients that we dont currently do business with and actually engage them as well so there are a lot of threads under that whole umbrella of being more for clients the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2023 robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research us lp thank you robin vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thanks rob operator our next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you hi robin hi dermot robin vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp hey gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc robin can you expand upon your comments about fednow you touched on it how youre one of the early adopters who are in the test phase and just what the implications are once this goes live throughout this system robin vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp so immediate payments are one of those disruption opportunities that dont come along that often in the overall ecosystem and you have to remember that the us is actually less advanced in some respects in terms of the speed and the efficiency of payments versus some other large countries around the world and so we look at this and say well we have a large installed client base thats pretty rooted in some of the classic payment methods we are a large check clearer were a large payments provider and we also have a pretty unconflicted approach because were not really in the credit card business which creates a little bit of fee disruption risk if you are in that business to embracing instant payments and so we identified this some years ago that this would be an opportunity that we would want to participate more in and thats exactly what weve been doing so weve been live on the clearing house rails for a while were now live on the fednow service those are essentially competitor instant payment services to each other but now we are going to be focused as i think the rest of the industry will be on the network effect thats going to be required to really adopt these instant payment rails and so were a provider to small and midsized banks helping them to access the rails we think there are a bunch of things that you can do with these new rails you couldnt do with some of the old rails request for payment is a great example the opportunity to really deliver ebilling instant requests for payments that can be met with instant perfectly timed payments theres a lot of control there the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2023 theres also some security opportunities who wants to give their bank account and aba number out and their credit card number out when youre dealing with various billingbased solutions and so operationalizing all of that with our clients is important we just launched bankify as i mentioned in my prepared remarks that allows consumers to be able to use these rails a little bit more efficiently and so look its early days in this disruption and i dont want to call exactly how and when its going to occur but we feel over time this is a good new technology and as we do see more network effect and these use cases start to go live it provides a lot of client value and so at the end of the day i think that client value is going to win out and we want to help them to do that gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great and then dermot you touched on with deposits the challenges the banking system faced earlier in this year and bank of new york was looked at as a safe haven in some peoples minds and your deposits have reflected that as you pointed out can you share with us if qt stays with the fed through the end of next year what kind of impact are you guys thinking that that could have on deposits throughout thank you dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp so i think its a bit too early for me gerard to give you guidance for on that but like as i said earlier we feel weve reached a more normalized level given what happened in march and then the debt ceiling and who knows whats going to happen from here but our balance sheet is positioned for higher for longer we have a lot of the balance sheet in cash our fixed income securities are going to roll off a quarter a year over the next few years and the pickup in yield from that is about to basis points so when we look at the balance sheet together we feel very good about our nii for the next while january will be when we give you more detailed guidance for how we think about it for but our deposit base and how our clients are in the ecosystem and look if theyre not with us for deposits we want them to be in our dreyfus money market fund complex and be using our products and services so we dont want to lose the cash we can put the cash into other products so i think we feel very good about where the deposit franchise is now we feel very good about the pipeline of activity thats coming our way but who knows and we are prepared and riskmanaged to a higher for longer continued qt et cetera et cetera et cetera robin vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp and gerard just to add one point to that when it comes to the rates markets weve avoided trying to have a crystal ball on exactly what it is thats going to happen we said we think resilience is a commercial attribute for us you highlighted the benefit of that resilience that we saw earlier on in the year as clients really came to us as a safe refuge and obviously were very happy to help them with that but that also means that we have views about what might happen we have views about how we position our balance sheet but ultimately we are positioning to be able to deal with any of these eventualities i sat on a trading desk for the first years of my career and the current level of 10year rates is at the bottom end of the the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2023 range over that period of time so theres absolutely no reason why the curve cant move further from here its moved basis points since midjuly at the 10year point and so we are positioning ourselves to be able to be adaptable to however the world is going to unfold and dermot commented on that when it came to our capital ratios earlier on now there are some things that have played out exactly as we thought other things that have played out a little differently i think the treasury has done a very good job in coordinating with the fed as they have ramped up the issuance of bills in particular and that has worked very gracefully with the rolldown of essentially trillion at this point of the rrp so the interplay between reserves between rrp between the very high levels of issuance coming out of the treasury these are all significant inputs and our data shows us that theres actually been less foreign buying in the treasury market over the course of this year and so theres going to be a supply and demand dynamic thats going to occur further out the curve which i dont think anybody can predict but you certainly have to be ready for the different ways that could play out gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you very much operator our next question comes from the line of brian bedell with deutsche bank please go ahead brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks good morning guys thanks for taking my question maybe just a nuance on the net interest revenue by segment so just the securities services versus the market and wealth segment it looks like there was more pressure on the securities service business nii versus the second quarter just wondering if that is more of the lull in nibs that you referenced dermot in august and if you think that might sort of just normalize as we move into the fourth quarter and i guess andor are you doing things internally in terms of the growth initiatives that you just talked about robin a couple answers ago that might accelerate the nir in that segment much more rapidly over time dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp so let me deal with the first question so i would say there is nothing really noticeable underneath the hood that is nuanced or is different by different segments if you think about asset servicing or issuer services as a segment its made up of three businesses asset servicing depositary receipts and corporate trust corporate trust as a business tends to attract a higher level of nibs due to the nature of that business  would have been a seasonally quieter period for that business debt issuance activity was more muted so that would explain a little bit of that and asset servicing lets just say like how clients are behaving with us at the moment in the ecosystem but i wouldnt really call anything out that is noticeably different and we think about our deposits as one platform centrally managed under one roof and thats how we manage it brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2023 okay great and then maybe just a followup on the actually in the other investment and other revenue theres one area there thats been growing quite nicely sequentially for now three straight quarters its the other trading revenue line and the size of that is now if you continue with this type of growth for the next two or three quarters youll be approaching your fx trading revenues i just wonder if you talk about the drivers of that and whether you see that type of growth path continuing dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp look the key feature of that business this quarter as it has been all of this year really has been the strength of our fixed income trading you do have a little bit of seed capital gains in there as well but its predominantly the fixed income trading so we feel very good about it in the overall kind of scheme of the quarter and the results its a small number in the big scheme of things but we like what we have there brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah great thanks very much robin vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thanks brian operator our next question comes from the line of glenn schorr with evercore isi please go ahead glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thanks so much robin vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp hi glenn glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi i know weve touched on this throughout the questions so you can be brief but i want to put it in a different package so its not lost on you weve seen a lesser ability to predict or control client behaviors from some of the peers when it comes to all things deposits and so i dont know if theres a way to give it the attribution but is there is it all related to your business mix and client base do you think your consolidated deposit efforts have actually moved the needle im just trying to get inside your confidence relative to what weve seen elsewhere and i dont know how much of that is depletion of non operating balances anyway so now you know most of whats left is operating so thanks a lot sorry if repetitive dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp so i will give you two dimensions to that answer glenn one is we have a portfolio of businesses that attract both interestbearing and noninterestbearing deposits corporate trust treasury services asset servicing the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2023 clearance and collateral management being the primary ones they all have different characteristics about them and they do things in slightly different ways so it kind of gives you a portfolio effect so that you feel like you have a diversified deposit platform i think thats important point number one important point number two is how we manage and price the deposits if you came to bny mellon three years ago you would have all of those deposits in different lines of business they would have all handled their clients separately they would have all priced their deposits separately and you would have ended up with suboptimal outcomes when you aggregate that up from the bny mellons standpoint now weve got global liquidity solutions its one team that interfaces with each of the line of the business but we price consistently we manage consistently and we have a pipeline that we think of as one firm i think you add all that together you get the 1bny mellon effect you get the strategy effect and you get the line of business effect and that gives us confidence that we have a good handle on our deposit franchise and where we want to be from here glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi thank you that was above what i was looking for operator our next question comes from the line of rajiv bhatia with morningstar please go ahead rajiv bhatia q analyst morningstar inc research great good morning just following up on the deposit conversations i mean by my calculations your deposit betas rose quite a bit in the quarter i guess can you comment on what your us dollar versus nonus dollar deposit betas were in the quarter and then how do your deposit betas differ across your lines of businesses such as asset servicing issuer servicing pershing and payments dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp so thanks for the question i guess of our book is dollars roughly euro roughly sterling and the rest other as it relates to betas i kind of think it in cumulative beta terms the cumulative beta of our dollar book is around which i think i said earlier and that hasnt materially changed quarteroverquarter sterling and euros are about respectively give or take a little bit and so we kind of feel as it relates to passing on the pricing the clients that we have are sophisticated largely passed on to prices as they come through and it may grind a little bit higher from here but overall we feel pretty good about where the book is where its priced you may see some modest catchups and lags here or there but overall we think its where it should be given whats happened in the market rajiv bhatia q analyst morningstar inc research great and then like your deposit betas by like lines of business dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2023 i dont have that level of detail with me so we can follow up with you offline rajiv bhatia q analyst morningstar inc research all right great thank you operator our next question comes from the line of jim mitchell with seaport global please go ahead jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning just a question you guys have had a lot of success in improving the organic growth in things like pershing collateral management but investment management has been sort of left out of that discussion longterm flows outside of liability management have been negative last year so do you see a organic growth opportunity there are you investing in that business and how do you improve that organic growth from here dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp thanks for the question jim look we said on a couple of calls ago that where the margin of that business is at the moment we feel we have work to do were not happy with it there are a bunch of things that have happened last year that are feeding into this year that have caused a remixing by our clients out of active strategies into passive which are lower fee paying out of equities into fixed income so theres rebalancing going on under the hood and were kind of attacking it in a number of different ways one being kind of getting after structural expense inefficiencies and weve talked a lot about that today and thats this segment is no different to that so were attacking it there were rolling out new products and thats going to take time to build aum but do that in a firstclass way we kind of think organic growth will come on the back of that inside of bny mellon we have a very kind of powerful distribution platform so were very focused on really energizing the distribution platform to support our boutique asset managers and weve made some leadership changes there this year and were going to begin to see the fruits of that in the coming quarters so were going at it in a number of different ways and some of the asset management boutiques are performing very well and were very happy with them and some of them have work to do and were very focused on it and were not sitting idle wishing it to happen were active in trying to make it happen jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc all right thats it for me thanks dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp thanks jim the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2023 operator and our final question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi just as a followup youve been giving a lot of optimism i know you have to execute but you said youre bending the cost curve nii should do pretty well the way youre positioning for rates youre investing for growth youre shooting for positive operating leverage next year so its all sounds pretty good when you think about the risk to the company over the next year what are the main risks that come to mind that you think you need to pay a little extra attention to whether its macro or micro robin vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp so ill just start mike with the way that you set up the initial part of the question youre right we are optimistic about the potential that we have in the company and the opportunities that our franchise and our businesses afford us now we havent lived up to that potential but the reason why you detect the optimism i think in the way that we talk about it is because we do have an inherent optimism that this is absolutely a doable proposition to unlock that potential now its a ton of work as dermot just said in answer to a different question were not going to wish our way there and maybe thats one of the things that weve really doubled down on now as a leadership team is that we have to work the problem and we have to work the problem through all of these different angles in order to really be able to unlock the potential and as i said in my prepared remarks theres a cultural change that we need to create in the company to take what has otherwise been a great culture but take it to the next level power it forward that really allows us to de silo and operate more broadly across the board and you and i just talked about that a few minutes ago we have to execute to get it done so of course there it follows from that that if really evolving the culture to desilo and to move towards this platform mindset and getting things done in execution are critical to us unlocking our potential then the biggest risks in the company in some respects from an internal point of view become not doing those things so we are laserfocused on doing those things tracking those things and as a leadership team really coming together to make sure that were holding each other to account for the respective parts that everybody in the leadership team of the company plays in moving that forward so thats the reason for the optimism but also the reason for the constant humility associated with the fact that its execution thats going to get the job done now in terms of the outside world theres clearly a ton going on in the world weve got geopolitical tensions through a continuum all the way to war in many regions of the world right now we have all of the uncertainty still of rates and inflation in the economy here in the us that creates uncertainties theres the everpresent cyber risk which we always take very seriously and those things are always collectively on our minds we dont pretend to predict exactly how things are going to occur we try to prepare for them as best we possibly can recognizing that thats what our clients need from us as we help them to adapt to this environment and that we manage through it so thats sort of the way that i think about both the internal and external answer to your question the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2023 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you robin vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thank you mike operator and with that that does conclude our questionandanswer session for today i would now like to hand the call
