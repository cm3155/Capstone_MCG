restored some confidence in our ability to deliver on our plans today we are publishing financial targets for each of our business segments and the firm overall dermot will review our fourth quarter financials the outlook for and our mediumterm financial targets in more detail but let me first briefly address our performance in referring to page of the financial highlights presentation our

significant operating leverage excluding notable items we generated the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 12jan2024 approximately basis points of positive operating

growth excluding notable items in we delivered and third we sought to return north of of earnings to common shareholders through dividends and buybacks we delivered over the course of we returned billion of capital to common shareholders all while having further strengthened our regulatory capital ratios to be well positioned for a wide range of macroeconomic and regulatory outcomes though we are still at the beginning of our transformation journey our ability this past year not just to deliver on our commitments but to exceed them gives us confidence that we can affect meaningful change and consistently improve our financial performance over time while mindful there is a lot more work ahead of us im proud of the effort that our people put in over the last months as we embraced a focus on commerciality accountability and efficiency which drove these results we are committed to improving the firms financial performance in the near medium and longterm and we have framed this work for our people with three strategic pillars which we describe on page last year we introduced these three pillars to get at the heart of how we operate and who we are daytoday for our clients managing their money moving it and keeping it safe pillar number one be more for our clients number two run our company better and number three power our culture they are deliberately simple and our people are rallying around them as ive said before strategy is important but ultimately just a set of words actually doing it and how we do it matters a lot im encouraged by the progress we made in some of which we highlight on slide our global clients across governments pension funds mutual funds unions endowments corporations financial services firms and individuals both trust and want to do more business with us and our analysis clearly shows there is more for them to do with us as we continue to partner alongside them to help achieve their ambitions as the global financial system grows

have an opportunity to bring more of bny mellon to clients who currently use us for just a single service last year we hired our first chief commercial officer as we began to operationalize our bny mellon initiative across the organization as part of enhancing the organizational setup and focus of our client coverage organization we created an integrated team to facilitate multiline of business solutions at scale and we also formed a coverage practice group to implement consistency in approach and tooling the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 12jan2024 next while was a foundational year in what will be a multiyear journey to transform to a more streamlined and effective operating model we took important steps toward running our company better to improve efficiency reduce bureaucracy and be more intentional with how we spend so our investments in the business go further we generated nearly double the amount of efficiency savings versus the prior year which allowed us to selffund over billion of incremental investments and we laid the foundation needed to transition to a platforms operating model including successful pilots in two areas of the organization which were important proof points as we start to unlock the power of our platforms in several phases over the next couple of years while we focus on being more for our clients and running our company better we know none of it can happen without our people which is why we are powering our culture to make bny mellon a place where people are proud to work and excited to grow their careers

across our company and we rolled out enhanced employee benefits recognizing value in fostering both a human and highperforming work environment ill wrapup where i began we remain confident in the strength of our culture our strategy and our ability to execute to help us unlock value for our clients our shareholders and our people was an important year in which we assembled more of the team that can deliver on what is needed and we got ourselves pointed in the right direction for what we need to achieve but it was also a year where being humble and resilient mattered while we have a lot of work ahead of us what has started as a theory and a belief now has early proof points and we can see the possibility of what we can achieve we have an ambitious agenda as we move forward but i continue to be optimistic about the opportunity ahead with that ill turn it over to dermot dermot william mcdonogh chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp thank you robin and good

results i will now turn to page and our current outlook for were entering the year on a strong footing and we set ourselves up determined to at least breakeven from an operating leverage perspective considering our healthy pipeline across the businesses we expect fee revenue growth to turn positive in with regards to net interest revenue our expectation for an approximately decrease yearoveryear is based on the assumption of marketimplied forward interest rates and we assume ongoing quantitative tightening puts further downward pressure on deposit balances we intend to keep expenses excluding notable items roughly flat in and finally with regard to capital management we expect to return north of of earnings to common shareholders through dividends and buybacks as robin discussed earlier was a foundational year for us we took decisive actions to demonstrate some early evidence of our ability to deliver stronger financial performance and importantly weve developed a clear roadmap for our multiyear transformation over the next couple of slides well provide you our mediumterm financial targets for the firm and some of the most impactful actions were taking to keep delivering on our goals page summarizes our consolidated targets it is our goal to improve the firms pretax margin to and our rotce to over the medium term while maintaining a strong balance sheet ill doubleclick on our business segments in a moment but along our three strategic pillars there are a number of themes that transcend our lines of business and segments robin mentioned several of these when he talked about our progress in so ill highlight just a few of them the first is our enhanced commercial model were driving a new culture of commerciality to deliver all of bny mellon in a unified front to facilitate deeper client relationships with solutions from across the firm with our clients at the center our model is led by client coverage teams with clear accountability to retain business expand revenue into new areas and drive client satisfaction our new sales operations and enablement organization the client coverage practice will make it easier for our clients to do more business with bny mellon and create consistent commercial roles tools and support internally for an enhanced and more efficient sales experience and what we call integrated solutions represent a new more focused approach to assembling components from multiple client platforms into repeatable gotomarket capabilities that span across our lines of business driving better value for our clients and higher profitable growth the second one id like to highlight is our transition to a platforms operating model by grouping similar activities together into logical platforms and uniting related capabilities we are enabling the streamlining of internal processes to drive higher efficiency and further enhance resiliency and risk management the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 12jan2024 our model is based on two types of platforms client platforms will own the delivery of a commercial solution to our external clients while enterprise platforms will own the delivery of internal services over the past few months weve developed a detailed implementation approach and our transition into this new model will be gradual and deliberate starting with the first implementation wave this spring and the third is our culture people come to bny mellon to make an impact on global financial markets while we focus on driving growth and running our company better none of it can happen without our people thats why were making meaningful investments including in enhanced learning development and feedback to foster exciting careers moving to our segments starting with securities services on page here we are reiterating our existing pretax margin target over the past months weve improved the margin from in to in were pleased with the performance of the business over the past two years but we appreciate that the path from to will be the harder yards first of all were firmly focused on driving down the cost to serve we have and we continue to make significant investments in uplifting several platforms that support core services including fund accounting tax services corporate actions and loan administration additionally we continue going after inefficient processes over the past couple of years we cataloged all of these processes and weve made some good progress in our digitization efforts but theres more work to do were also taking a more strategic approach to deepening client relationships going forward using enhanced tools to better understand client behavior quality of service economics and revenue opportunities we are expanding wallet share and improving client profitability last but not least were pursuing several opportunities to drive an acceleration of underlying growth on the back of our investments over the years we have become a premier provider of etf servicing globally and we expect to maintain our strong momentum through continued innovation similarly in private markets another one of the fastestgrowing market segments weve established a strong market position with more room to expand our capability set moving on to market and wealth services on page as you can see on the left side of the page this segment has a good track record of solid growth and attractive margins our focus here is to accelerate growth through deliberate investments without compromising profitability ill start with pershing our companys second largest line of business as the number one clearing firm for broker dealers and a top three ria custodian pershing benefits from a strong position in one of the fastestgrowing segments in financial services ie the us wealth market notwithstanding nearterm headwinds from the events of we are confident that our investments in the core platforms and client experience will drive further market share gains in the attractive market segment of the growing billionplus rias and hybrid brokerdealers and our wove platform continues to gain momentum as were capturing business from existing clients and new opportunities to deliver the platform data and investment solutions were currently projecting million to million of incremental revenue from wove in the bank of new york mellon corp bk

and nbfi clients and the completion of multiyear uplift of our payments platform is expected to drive an increase to our swift market share through growth in several geographies additionally by joining forces with our markets business which provides fx solutions in over currencies treasury services will enhance the fx capabilities that it can provide its clients rounding out the segment clearance and collateral management as a primary provider of settlement for all us government securities trades and the largest global collateral manager in the world we have a special role in financial markets and were taking this role very seriously no doubt this business grows as markets grow but were not resting on our position our clearance and collateral management business is one of the most innovative in the company and so were confident that this business can maintain its healthy growth trajectory by continuously launching new flexible collateral management solutions that position our clients to meet their growing liquidity needs and by continuing to increase collateral mobility and optimization across global client venues next investment and wealth management on page investment and wealth management reported a pretax margin of for the full year or excluding notable items our plan is to improve the segment margin to or higher over the mediumterm on the back of a combination of growth and efficiency initiatives first were unlocking bny mellons distribution power for the benefit of our investment firms and our clients most importantly were in the process of creating a firmwide distribution platform that combines inhouse products with offerings from select thirdparty managers to provide bestinclass solutions additionally were making enhancements to how

shareholders over time over the past years the firm grew dividends per share at an cagr and returned almost of earnings to shareholders through a combination of dividends and buybacks our philosophy for capital deployment and capital distribution remains unchanged weve entered the year with strong capital ratios ator above our management target of approximately to tier leverage and approximately cet1 and assuming interest rates follow marketimplied forwards we the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 12jan2024 expect to generate additional excess capital from

our progress and we are confident that we will deliver we are excited about the work ahead of us and today is an important milestone for our team now for those of you who are still with us we promise to let you start your long weekend soon with that operator can you please open the line for audio gap question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of brennan hawken with ubs please go ahead brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good afternoon thanks for taking my question and thanks for all the detail that you provided in the deck on the targets really very very helpful very very thoughtful id love to start there so it seems as though you guys see a really strong pretax margin enhancement opportunity where do you expect that youre going to see the results of that opportunity come through first and while i appreciate that the targets are over a three to fiveyear period is the profile of the improvement that you expect likely to look straight line or is there going to be sort of a more parabolic curve resulting in more of a backend weighting thanks dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp hi brennan this is dermot ill start off so the way i kind of think about it if you take the comments that both robin and i have prepared and weve just laid out over the last to minutes you can see truly that was a foundational year we did a lot of exploratory work detailed planning weve made a bunch of investments both which will drive efficiency and which will drive growth weve talked a lot over the last few quarters about wove which we launched last june and in my prepared remarks i talked about million to million of revenue this year so i would say were making investments in all of our segments and you can also see it in investment and wealth management where we are beginning to see green shoots and you can see were making a lot of investments in our securities services businesses modernizing our platforms so i would say youre going to see it quarterby quarter and i think over time as you get to know robin and myself youll see us do it and then talk about it rather the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 12jan2024 than preannounce it and then do it so were in execution mode and we will deliver but youre going to see this happen quarterbyquarter brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay thank you very much for that color i appreciate it the environment is rather different from the last time we spoke weve seen an indication of a fed pivot everyone is now expecting far more short order policy rates to be declining and so we saw an uplift even though there was only a little bit of averaging in of policy rate a little higher this quarter we did see an uptick in on the deposit cost side so what drove that and then how should we be thinking about the mechanics of the lower policy rate and how that might flow through on the deposit side and whats captured in your nii outlook for a few questions in there sorry dermot dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yes i was going to say for a followon question that was special yeah brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc got my moneys worth dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah so hopefully others wont have to ask the same question again so look if you go back months when we gave our guidance for there was a disconnect between what the market thought was going to happen in and what the fed thought was going to happen in the market was calling for rate cuts in june of and the fed wasnt we guided the year played out very very differently to what everybody thought was going to happen and we ended up with a year to one of your questions where why did deposit costs go up i think our nim for  was in the range and that really is balances rolling off and new balances coming on at market rates and we ran strong to the tape at the yearend and look i have to say how we did on deposits in  was a little bit of a bny mellon effort between lines of business our deposit team our treasurer and our cio book so we feel very good about how we finished the year and we outperformed billion of revenue so all in all we feel very good about that this year again i think the fed and the markets are a little bit at odds we had a fed commentator talk a couple of days ago about march being too early notwithstanding that the market thinks theres an probability of a rate cut happening in march so were neutrally positioned in the outlook for on balance if the rates happen and six cuts happen this year we might expect balances to go up if its higher for longer we expect people to optimize and we say continued outflow of deposits but we start the year strong with billion of average deposits in  we feel good about our nim for so we feel were set up nicely but the balance of outcomes we think down for brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay thanks for taking my questions and thanks for the patience with multipart the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 12jan2024 operator our next question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities please go ahead mr mayo your line is unmuted please go ahead check your mute button actually im not hearing you robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp mike we cant hear you so well come back to you maybe have an issue connecting mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc actually im here can you hear me now robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp oh yeah just in the nick of time mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay just made it so let me see if i did okay in my math class in school so in youre guiding for flat expenses flat or higher operating leverage nii down that implies fees up so did i do my math correctly and if i did it correctly why only up robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp so mike its robin were not going to quibble with your math or with your english comprehension either from our commentary youve gotten it right what we said weve intentionally not guided on fees because of the nature of the year and we recognize that there are a lot of different inputs to that so we recognize that the year can in fact turn out in various different ways we feel committed to the flat to plus on the operating leverage that weve committed to and weve guided to how we think the other things are going to play out and so that was quite deliberate and were focusing you on the things that weve talked about but obviously from a math point of view we understand how the math works mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc the more important question would just be your mediumterm target to take your returns to up from last year or i guess or so this past year how do you define the medium term and for that basis point increase from here how would you segment that like your efficiency revenues buybacks or some other way just to give us like a simple waterfall chart in words dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp so the way i would think about it mike is not to give you a weak answer it really is all of the above and if you think about fee revenue were very focused on higher organic growth and we set about that and weve made a lot of mention about the chief commercial officer bny mellon and kind of just generally desiloing the organization we really feel optimistic about being able to deliver over time higher organic growth the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 12jan2024 also in fx volumes around the world and volatility was lower and so we expect fx revenue that to normalize which give us a boost and look were optimistic about where equity markets are going to go and so in our plans we have midsingledigit equity market appreciation to support that fee revenue growth on expenses look i think was a year where we got 50plus thousand employees on the same page as how robin and i think about and the management team think about running our company better we dont talk about cost cutting or head count layoffs we talk about what are the things that we need to do to run this company better and i think we have people aligned with us now and i feel very optimistic through all the projects that we have underway to digitize the firm automate processes deliver more for our clients so everything will feed together and well do a lot at the same time and with all of that well be able to buy back more stock which will drive us to that higher rotce and pretax margin that you talked about robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp and mike ill just add one thing to that which is we talked at the beginning of and you pressed us on this and rightly so in about the fact that we hadnt before managed to tell the improved expense story that we think we actually ended up telling on in and that was an important focus we also recognized that we were likely to have a good nii year and we took the opportunity of those two things to be able to invest for future fee growth and we never thought was likely to be a very strong fee year because the fees take time to be able to generate the return from the investment that were putting into it through the various different things that dermot just detailed and so weve set ourselves up we think to now be able to really leverage those investments and thats a story now of course well stay focused on nii well absolutely stay focused on efficiencies and expenses we think ai will play a story in that over time probably not a shortterm story but more of a mediumterm story and thats how the whole thing comes together from an operating leverage point of view so the way we got there in is probably going to be different than the way well get there in were trying to point you to that through the disclosures mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thank you operator our next question comes from the line of brian bedell with deutsche bank please go ahead brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 12jan2024 great thanks good afternoon folks thanks for taking my questions again also thanks for all the detail around the businesses and longterm outlook as well if i can focus on slide in the securities servicing sic securities services goals there how do you think about in terms of automating the processes those first two boxes that drive the cost to serve down and then the second one on deepening client relationships how do you think about the effect of digitizing and automating these processes and whether sort of matching that against to what extent you can actually enhance the revenue profile as well are you favoring lowering the cost and not so much enhancing the revenue profile by digitizing the services or is there two parts of that where you can also improve the servicing quality dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp okay so heres how i would answer that brian so weve and i said in my prepared remarks weve made a lot of through last year and this year in the budget process we have made a lot of investments in our foundational infrastructure that supports the asset servicing business and so thats going to result in greater automation and a better client experience we hired a new head of operations last year and hes made a tremendous impact and spending a lot of time with our clients through understanding client behaviors where they are able to explain to us what they need and we can then figure out how to change our processes to be more automated to deliver their solutions so weve made a lot of good progress there so through driving down the cost to serve were going to give better client experience which will then ultimately lead to enhanced revenue and enhanced client experience because the clients will be happy with us the other thing i would say is for asset servicing specifically we had our strongest sales quarter in we come into with a very healthy uninstalled book of business and we feel very good about the mandates we won in  and we feel very good about the pipeline coming into so i feel very very good about all the leadership changes that weve made in asset servicing over the last months the hires weve made and the impact that theyve made since theyve joined and then within the other part of securities services corporate trust and depositary receipts were making significant investments in corporate trust this year to do a lot more digitization and a lot more automation so we can scale the business and drive that margin higher brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thats great color and then just a followon on the balance sheet deposit beta the fed cuts and maybe if you can also comment on international cuts from the bank of england and ecb how are you viewing your deposit beta on the downside do you think within your guidance are you able to move that down commensurately or is there a significant lag and does that differ between the us and europe dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp so just to give you a general framework nothing really has much changed quarteroverquarter the dollar book which is roughly of the overall portfolio has an beta as ive said many times we have sophisticated the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 12jan2024 clients they are with us for not just deposits but for a variety of goods and services which feeds the stickiness of our overall deposits being twothirds operational so thats a good story we passed on the price as ive said it will grind a little bit higher from here but i think i feel pretty good about the dollar book and where thats at and then euros and sterling which make up the balance are in the to beta range and so as the rate as the fed ultimately will pivot and rates will come down we do expect that to follow symmetrically and so go down the same way it came up so thats how i would view that brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thanks great great thank you robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thanks brian operator our next question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good afternoon robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp hey ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i had a followon question just around looking at your mediumterm targets and i heard what you said in response to mikes question on the fee revenue guide for this year but when i looked at your strategic targets i guess its deliberate that we dont have a revenue growth number in there or a revenue growth target and im just wondering is that due to the macro or your view on the business where you dont have a line of sight around being able to sustain a certain level of revenue growth and i ask this because i think thats probably the toughest part of the bk investment story is whats the sustainable level of revenue growth you gave a lot of details around products and businesses but would love to hear in terms of how you think one should think about baseline revenue growth in a more or less normal macro environment over the coming years dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp okay thanks for the question ebrahim so ive been here months now so ill give you my perspective right in terms of my history and ive studied the firm and how what weve accomplished over the last months and how i see the future the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 12jan2024 so over the past years bny mellon has delivered organic growth north of but it hasnt done it in a consistent fashion and so we want to be able to talk to you in a consistent manner and well give you guidance we want to know that when we give guidance you believe that were going to do it so for we think were going to turn positive on fee growth we feel we set the firm up but we dont want to give out guidance that has not got a track record of success and so ive said this in answer to some other questions asset servicing we feel like we have strong momentum we feel were making the right investments to power that business forward and that will its our biggest business and so we feel like pretax margin is going to go up as a result of efficiency and fee growth and then if you take market and wealth services our most profitable segment clearance and collateral management treasury services and pershing all have mid pretax margin and all have good opportunities for growth but then again fee growth is a little bit dependent on the market and a big part of it is what happens to the market and that guides us to be a little bit more cautious with giving you guidance overall on fee growth but each of our businesses in terms of the underlying fundamentals we feel very very good about robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp ebrahim ill just add to that and we debated this a lot about the fact that you dont have the dollar output guidance on fees and so as a result what weve been trying to do is really make sure that were communicating to you on all of the inputs to that but as dermot said there is both a market impact potential well have to see how the markets evolve and theres a bit of a portfolio effect which is weve really invested in a lot of different places we have good confidence around the fact that several of those are going to yield something in and then hopefully continue to yield more in but its hard for us to be able to know exactly whats going to hit and exactly when its going to hit so weve got a confidence on a portfolio basis around those investments but we dont have the absolute line of sight that makes us comfortable to tell you the exact number in the exact quarter that its actually going to hit and so all we can do is show you the inputs and now point to a year of track record in around the fact that we have in fact made progress on the things that we said we were committed to make progress on ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful good color thank you and just a separate question i mean im sure most investors like the fact that youre going to be buying back stock but when you think about given the sort of run in the stock valuation wise is there any sensitivity to where you probably dont want to be leaning into buybacks and secondly are there other good uses of capital one of them being inorganic madriven growth or is that just off the table right now the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 12jan2024 robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp so youre right that we have an implied waterfall of how we think about our capital and the first is to be able to invest it profitably well in the business and then towards the bottom of that waterfall is if we have surplus capital after weve taken those things into account we want to return it to our shareholders and thats what weve been doing and so that waterfall hasnt changed in how we think about it now in terms of ma right now were focused on what we have and how we think that we can improve it thats really been the story dermot really made the point around running our company better and we think that theres so much opportunity in the franchise to be able to run ourselves better and have the growth that we havent wanted to distract ourselves with ma now we have a high bar weve had a high bar we continue to have a high bar but we are keeping our eyes open and i think thats the right thing to do particularly for things that would help us to accelerate our delivery were not looking at transformation were not looking at big pivots but we are always interested in things that can in their own way speed us on the journey that weve laid out to you ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc right thank you for taking the questions operator our next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good afternoon so last year you guys did a really good job setting a hittable bar on that nii point that you made earlier and we ended up seeing a nice increase to nii to the end of the year up to billion so im just wondering given that youre still setting a new bar to down which implies definitely like a settling down from the billion im wondering to the prior conversation on rates just can you help us understand like the cadence of that the direction of travel and then with regards to the rates forecast youre building in like when that settles back down and starts to bottom thanks dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp new yearly guidance im not too sure i really want to commit to quarterly guidance deposit levels we finished the year strong that was a variety of factors as i said in my prepared remarks we had four months of consecutive growth i talked at barclays in september i talked at goldman in december we feel very good about the deposit franchise we feel very good about what clients are doing with us and so we bank it as it comes but when i sit back and i look out at the macro and this is what we said this time last year we expected deposits to go down by mid to highsingle digits and itd ultimately be it was down for us thats the trajectory i expect to happen this year and so i dont have a particular magic ball on whats going to happen quarter by quarter so i would just take the down and divide it by for your model and just see where that gets you the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 12jan2024 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it and then as a corollary to that your comments on the movement to a flattish expense base from a successful plus last year is a meaningful move and i know it foots to that point we just ended on which it still incorporates a down nii presuming we get past this point and nii does get stable andor the fee income starts to grow i presume youre not trying to point us to a flattish expense trajectory for the longerterm future but maybe you can talk us to how you will manage that positive operating leverage gap and relative to needed investments and then the margin targets you just gave us to in terms of how you deal with volatility of the macro environment while getting to that point of seeing those margin target improvements robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp so ken its robin ill start off dermot might want to add something look i think about this at a fairly high level of us being focused on positive operating leverage at least until the point that we get to the sort of margin targets that were talking about and theres a little bit of work between here and there and we also recognize that each year is going to have unique factors and so the year in which we have a fairly significant nii jump of the is going to create different conditions that allowed us to have a fee year which was fine but not growing in a meaningful way and that allowed for some headroom on expenses which was which is something that weve used in order to be able to make investments now is a different year its got a different composition but every one of the years that we face has each of these inputs it has fees it has nii and it has expenses and were trying to be very purposeful around solving for operating leverage in the context of the year that we actually are faced with and we think that thats the right thing to do recognizing that markets move around and each year brings excuse me serves us something different we manage whats in our control dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp so ken ill go a little bit off script here its a bit of a cultural moment for us on just expense management financial discipline running our company better i talked with one of the executive committee yesterday and he said dermot you have a very high bar for yourself on flat expenses for and i said no we have a high bar we as a firm and thats down to all of us and we talked to our managing director population earlier today and were all in it together about running our company better and i think thats an important culture pivot that weve managed to achieve over the last months ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah got it thank you guys appreciate it operator our next question comes from the line of glenn schorr with evercore isi please go ahead glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 12jan2024 thanks very much so just one big question if i could so i think youve been talking about getting clients to do more business with bank of new york mellon which and youre executing on getting them better and you invested a lot i did hear you today talk about improve the service and then clients will consolidate business so my question is high level it feels its natural and it feels like its working but youre putting a lot of effort and expense at improving and modernizing and digitizing your businesses that actually havent been growing as much andor need to modernize more and have lower margins to improve them but is there any thought towards maybe youre supposed to put capital towards actually your highest profitable business and ones that grow its a question on do you need the whole portfolio basically robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp so the short answer to your question glenn is yes we do and as dermot has laid out and weve laid out in the materials particularly there is a subtly different flavor to the investments that we are making in each of our segments and so in the securities services segment our focus is on the efficiency and cost to serve as well as growth we havent ignored growth but we recognize that making sure that our margin in that business continues to improve will allow us to be even more competitive because were the worlds largest custodian we want the benefits of our scale to fully translate into our pricing with customers and the service that we can provide so its got a tilt towards efficiency in that business and theres a lot of digitization that can be brought to bear there we are excited about the mediumterm potential of ai were excited about the shorterterm benefits of our new leadership team in operations and the things that emily and her team are working on are really targeted to that but we havent forgotten about growth in the space and thats why dermot mentioned we actually had our best sales quarter at the end of last year in that business now youre right in our market and wealth services business which has a margin that frankly were quite happy with and you havent heard us talk about growing that margin we really want to grow that business at that margin and thats our focus there so thats really where our drive drive drive around more revenues a lot of our investments around our new business thats where we built wove is in that business dermot talked about the clearance and collateral management business where weve had very significant growth over the course of this year he talked about the investments that were making in our treasury services business as well where weve gotten you so thats where we are really wanting to try to grow the overall revenue and then in our investment and wealth management business where weve had higher margin before and now weve been subject of course to the more difficult market environment thats driven it down but thats a place where wed like to return to our prior margins a little bit of market would help on that but also some of the structural changes that weve been making the new product launches that weve been doing the opportunity to make investment management part of bny mellon as opposed to just a separate piece not availing itself of the trillion plus of distribution we have which at the end of the day was completely orphaned previously from the trillion worth of manufacturing so the way in which were solving the problem varies according to the segment the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 12jan2024 dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp and what i would add there glenn is its in my remarks but we invested billion last year in things that we wanted to do that was going to grow the company while keeping our expense growth rate at so were very disciplined about what we want to do getting value for money while at the same time manage the expense base of the firm glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi thanks so much for all that operator our next question comes from the line of manan gosalia with morgan stanley please go ahead manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good afternoon can you talk about your assumptions around qt in your nii guide and are you assuming it continues at the current rate so if the fed does slow and does end qt early would that be a big benefit to your deposit growth and to nii dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp so our nii guidance is based on marketimplied forward rates at the end of the year with qt continuing and so with qt continuing we expect deposits to roll off if qt were to change then obviously we would revisit and see what the benefits of that would be and run our models again and then we will come and talk to you but that is not our base case qt ending anytime soon manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc but on a net basis that should help the noninterestbearing deposit balances dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp it should help yes but i couldnt give you a sensitivity to it here today and its not our base case manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay great and then if you could help us with how we should think about the securities book with six rate cuts is there still a large chunk of the securities book that still reprices higher even if we get six cuts dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp so  ill start with  as you will see in the financial supplement the securities book rolled down by about billion largely deployed into cash and some mortgages etcetera and we had a yield pickup there of about basis points in we expect the yield pickup from the rolldown to be about basis points to basis the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 12jan2024 points so rolling off is about into current market rates its very liquid quite like short in duration so overall we feel good about the outlook for the book in manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thanks manan operator our next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good afternoon robin and dermot dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp hey gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc dermot i know you touched on this with the net interest revenue already in terms of your expectations for being down following i think the forward curve correct me if im wrong there if the forward curve is incorrect currently six rate cuts and it comes in closer to two or three for the year how does that affect that guidance dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp so i would say the theoretical answer to that is youre higher for longer and so therefore people will continue to optimize their deposits into higher yielding assets so you could see the base case you could see balances run off more but weve kind of analyzed this topdown bottomup left to right and so the best guidance we give you is but if it transpired to be a different number obviously the nii number would be different gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc sure no understood okay thank you and maybe robin and i apologize if you guys already talked about this or its in the deck your new business wins this quarter what was the dollar amount of that and whats the installed base that you have for next year dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 12jan2024 so we dont give specific guidance on the installed base or backlogs but i would say look i said it in an answer to an earlier question and its in my prepared remarks  sales was our strongest of we won mandates in the middle east asset managers largest clients giving us more business so look we feel very good about what we accomplished in asset servicing in and the team feel very kind of bulled up about and what the opportunities are in front of them gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good okay i appreciate it thank you operator our next question comes from the line of rob wildhack with autonomous research please go ahead robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research us lp hi guys couple more on deposits dermot you mentioned a couple times that youve had four straight months of deposit growth to close it seems that a lot of the things that would weigh on deposits in were or already are headwinds in and yet despite that youve been able to grow deposits so im curious if theres anything else that you think might change or become more of a headwind from the last third of and into and if there is a possibility or an environment where deposits actually do come in better than whats in the guide dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp so look overall a big part of the deposit base our deposit base too is nibs and where that goes so look the reality is  was clients and hard work by our team and it worked out and we outperformed by million and we take it but hindsight is everything and its behind us so we bank it and we move on when i sit here today and i sat here last january didnt turn out the way everybody thought it was going to turn out and so who knows whats going to happen in and so there is a lot of uncertainty out there so i feel very comfortable with the down and if that changes to the upside were going to be the first people to tell you because we would like it to be not that number wed like to be a better number but thats the number we give you today robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp and rob ill just add its easy to forget we still got a lot of complexity in the world as dermot said earlier on if qt continues thats one thing if qt ends maybe thats to the plus youve also had a massive run up in liquidity over the course of the in money market funds and other places we have to see how that gets put to work or not as the case may be stock market therefore becomes a little bit of a wildcard as we see the flow of funds so we still have the complexity of we talk about the fact that the fed might cut in march the fed talks about the fact that they might not cut in march so theres enough variation in the exact way that this is going to play out and thats why dermot answered one of the earlier questions in the way that he did around our and the path the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 12jan2024 of it because we just dont have that type of visibility but we do have the sense that we can work the problem to our current guidance robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research us lp okay thanks and then i think earlier you mentioned something about deposits that were not yet seasoned or not yet operational and i was just wondering if you could expand on that whats the criteria for a deposit to be considered operational and then how long does it take for something like that to play out dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp so thats theres a very long answer to that which we can take you through offline but the general sense of to be operational you have to be doing stuff with us in another line of business and you have to be making payments and you have to be sticky to us as the firm and over time then wed classify you as operational in nature and that helps us on the liquidity ratio standpoint so if youre a relatively new client and you havent established that track record then youre considered non operational until such time as you meet those criteria but as i said earlier twothirds of our deposits overall are sticky and thats a good fact robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research us lp got it thank you guys robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thanks rob operator our next question comes from the line of rajiv bhatia with morningstar please go ahead rajiv bhatia q analyst morningstar inc research great can you comment on the pricing environment within your securities services segment i guess auca was up against flat fee revenue so is pricing pressure would you say its stable or would you say its intensifying thanks dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp so i would say its overall stable and its something that we gave a particular focus to last year and weve gone through it clientbyclient analyzed client profitability which clients are profitable which clients arent what we can do in terms of cost to serve and how do we price on a marginal basis versus a fully loaded basis so over the last months weve done a lot of foundational work on how weve become more sophisticated in terms of how we priced our business and how we talk to clients visàvis pricing so i would say stable with a positive momentum to it the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 12jan2024 rajiv bhatia q analyst morningstar inc research great thanks operator and our final question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi thanks for the followup at the boston bank conference in november emily portney the head of your asset servicing business seemed very excited about ai and the implications and the implementation of that in the asset servicing business and im just wondering if that excitement is shared throughout bny mellon and what you see as potential use cases and the ability to go from pilots to production beyond the hype where is the reality of ai and any specific numbers of what it might be able to do robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah mike look the short answer is yes we are excited about ai were excited about it over the medium term we stood up in what we call the ai hub where we gathered up a bunch of engineers under sort of top talent leadership to really focus on building out a set of capabilities they worked with every business and every function in the firm to canvas for use cases we had hundreds of those we developed a series of different themes for investment because theres a lot of duplication actually across the different use cases when you think about them on a fundamental functional basis and then these themes for investment are things that weve actually been investing in and so we do have things in production we actually have a piece of software today that is creating predictions for clients in our treasurys business actually that looks at fails weve talked about that before thats a good example and that was a very early ai implementation that we made and its actually a piece of software that we currently earn some revenue on as part of our ccm business it also contributes more broadly to market stability and its a great client service on the flip side of that the question is going to be well for an organization which has as many processes as we have and people performing processes theres going to be an opportunity there to create more efficiency and so weve invested in and are investing in that space as well were also investing in the employee experience the opportunity to have ai do tasks which are mundane or repetitive in one particular case its helping our research team get a march on the day so rather than getting up at oclock in the morning to write research they get up at oclock in the morning to write research because the ai has given them a rough draft to start with and served up a bunch of data for them so there are all sorts of different things now we havent put it into numbers and so its not directly in our outlooks in terms of the way that were thinking about it but it would not surprise me if this is something that over the course of the next decade is going to be able to provide benefit on the top line and the bottom line and so were doing exactly what dermot said before were not talking too much about things that were still working on that we cant give you line of sight into the exact input but im answering the question because you asked it but we are excited about this under the hood for sure the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 12jan2024 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp youre welcome
