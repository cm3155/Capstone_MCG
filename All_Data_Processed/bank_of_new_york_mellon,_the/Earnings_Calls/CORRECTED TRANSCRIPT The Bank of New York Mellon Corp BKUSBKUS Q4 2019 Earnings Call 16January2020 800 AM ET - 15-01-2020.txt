reported earnings of billion and earnings per share of this includes a positive impact of per share from notable items which mike will discuss for the full year on an adjusted basis eps of on revenues of billion full year expenses were down slightly as we identified and implemented efficiencies to more than offset the increase in technology investments what that means is we actually delivered hundreds of millions of dollars of real productivity and we had solid operating margins of approximately we generated over billion of capital in returning more than of earnings to shareholders through dividends and buybacks while at the same time maintaining a strong capital position investing for growth and achieving a solid return on tangible common equity of greater than this year was not without its challenges however and notably those included interest rate cuts in the us and while some equity markets hit new highs client activity levels were constrained in many of our business despite this fees in investment services were resilient and we saw some modest organic revenue growth we also delivered strong operating margins and capital returns for our shareholders we built a

contingent net asset value calculation solutions for clients this is just the beginning in operations we have numerous initiatives in flight across the businesses that are already yielding

helping us do things such as reimagine the billing process and employ ai to resolve client inquiries faster across the company weve been disciplined about the investments were making and are focused on driving efficiency in our technology spend as an example were simplifying our infrastructure and were reducing the number of applications which are now down over the past months or so in the next months it will be reduced by another 10plus so a total reduction of 20plus in applications over a two to three year period so to summarize while we have more work to do were on the right path were beginning to see the benefits of the investments made over recent years and will continue to invest and weve made progress on a host of initiatives while maintaining strong operating margins and capital returns as we look to our priorities are unchanged they are centered on one driving sustainable revenue growth through a strong performance culture focused on improving service quality as well as fostering faster innovation two improving every aspect that we can within our operations maintaining our investment in technology is key to this our overall technology spend for is expected to exceed the billion we spent in three were continuing to drive efficiency throughout the organization through automation as well as good expense discipline and four ensuring we continue to deliver

foundation and we are excited about the future prospects for the firm the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16jan2020 with that ill turn it over to mike to review the financial results in more detail michael santomassimo chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp thanks todd and good morning everyone let me run through the details of the results for the quarter all comparisons will be on a yearoveryear basis unless i specify otherwise beginning on page the financial highlights document in the final quarter of net earnings of billion and earnings per share of in both the current and prior year quarters included a number of notable items the notable items in the fourth quarter of were costs related to severance the relocation of our corporate headquarters and litigation expenses partially offset by some tax adjustments reducing our earnings by per share and in the fourth quarter of we benefited by per share from the gain on sale of an equity investment partially offset by severance net securities losses and litigation expenses total revenue was billion fee revenue increased with nearly all of that from the gain on the sale of the equity investment underlying that investment services fees were up foreign exchange and other trading was down and most other line items were relatively flat net interest revenue declined to million expenses were down slightly but excluding the notable items were up with the increase driven by technology we generated billion in net income applicable to common shareholders or million excluding the notable items we continue to have a strong return on tangible common equity and maintain a solid pretax margin in terms of shareholder capital returns we repurchased approximately million shares for just over billion and paid million in dividends in the fourth quarter weve reduced the number of shares outstanding by a little over since the beginning of for the full year of we returned billion to common shareholders which is over of earnings through billion of share repurchases and approximately billion in dividends moving now to capital and liquidity on page our capital and liquidity ratios remained strong all of our key ratios were strengthened since the third quarter common equity tier capital totaled billion at the end of the year and our cet1 ratio was under the advanced approach our average lcr in the fourth quarter was and our slr was including the impact of the recent change to the rule our slr would have been approximately basis points higher turning to page my comments on the balance sheet will highlight the sequential changes net interest revenue was million up almost versus the lease adjusted net interest revenue in the third quarter as we have mentioned previously we have been focused on growing and optimizing our deposit base for the last months or so for example weve been working with wealth management clients to convert their cash from offbalance sheet investments to onbalance sheet deposits our sales teams have been focused on attracting additional client deposits and other businesses and weve been targeting escrow and other opportunities while being disciplined about pricing all of these initiatives and some of the macro factors contributed to the result the activity that drove the outperformance versus our expectations came in the last few weeks of the year and some of it was episodic now as you look at the drivers both noninterestbearing and interestbearing deposits increased across our businesses some of the noninterestbearing and interestbearing deposits related to some targeted activity including episodic corporate actions and other activities which we do not expect to repeat in  margin and non the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16jan2020 margin loans in our securities portfolio balance increased modestly the loan balances were driven by increased client demand the yield on interestearning assets continued to decline as expected due to the decline in shortterm rates as the fed cut rates at the end of the third quarter and again in october the increase in intermediate and longterm interest rates is helpful but the overall yield on the securities portfolio loans and other interestearning assets declined the shortterm rates had a bigger impact sequentially we also made minor adjustments to our securities portfolio that should modestly enhance the yields going forward the reduction in asset yields was partially offset by lower deposit rates and other funding costs lastly at the end of december we did benefit modestly from higher spreads and activity levels indiscernible retail business and from the money we deployed in reverse repo at yearend although repo rate over yearend ultimately normalized we were able to lock in some trades when reverse repos were between and we dont expect yearend pricing to repeat again in  all of this activity resulted in our net interest margin remaining flat at basis points versus the lease adjusted nim in the third quarter as weve said in the past were focused on driving higher net interest revenue and we will continue to take advantage of low risk opportunities even if theyre not nim accretive page gives you some more detail about the drivers of the net interest revenue increase versus the third quarter we can see how the increased client deposit volumes higher interestearning assets and lower funding costs benefited our net interest revenue this more than offset the decline in interestearning asset yields page details our expenses on a consolidated basis expenses of billion were down slightly the decrease is mostly due to the impact of expenses associated with the relocation of our headquarters in the fourth quarter of and lower litigations and excluding notable items expenses were up primarily reflecting the continued investments in technology turning to page total investment services revenue was down assets under custody andor administration increased yearoveryear to trillion primarily reflecting higher market values and client inflows although the higher market levels were a bigger driver we did see good organic auca growth throughout the course of the year within asset servicing revenue was down to billion primarily reflecting lower net interest revenue and volatility impacting foreign exchange revenue partially offset by the impact of higher equity markets asset servicing fees in this business were up slightly foreign exchange and other trading revenue was down due to lower foreign exchange volatility and volumes the pipeline continues to remain healthy dialogue with clients remains active and were not seeing an acceleration in pricing pressure in pershing total revenue was up to million clearing fees were up reflecting growth in client assets and accounts from new business onboarded and from existing clients which was partially offset by lower net interest revenue issuer services was down to million on lower depositary receipts revenue which was partially offset by higher client activity in corporate trust the decline in depositary receipts revenue was due to the timing of fees and crossborder settlement activity as well as lower net interest revenue the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16jan2020 treasury services revenue was flat at million as higher client activity and payment fees were offset by lower net interest revenue fees were up sequentially treasury services revenue was up driven by higher net interest revenue clearance and collateral management revenue was up to million reflecting growth in collateral management and clearance volumes which were mostly offset by lower net interest revenue average triparty collateral management balances were up page summarizes the key drivers that affected the yearoveryear revenue comparisons for each of our investment services business now turning to page for investment management total investment management revenue was up asset management revenue was up yearoveryear to million primarily reflecting higher market values and the impact of hedging activities partially offset by the cumulative aum outflow since the third quarter of performance fees of million were down from the fourth quarter of which was one of our stronger quarters in a while we had outflows of billion in the quarter and overall assets under management of trillion were up yearoveryear due to higher markets and the favorable impact of the weaker us dollar partially offset by net outflows the sequential market impact is negative due to lower uk fixed income market values which more than offset the impact of the increased equity market values and managed assets wealth management revenue was down yearoveryear to million primarily reflecting lower net interest revenue partially offset by slightly higher fees that benefited from higher market values and client assets grew yearonyear turning to our other segment on page total revenue increased reflecting the previously referenced gain on sales of the equity investment partially offset by the net securities losses that were due to a small portfolio rebalancing now before we open it to questions ill spend just a few minutes on how were thinking about the first quarter in as i mentioned earlier net interest revenue in the third quarter was better than expected in part due to some episodic balances so at this point in the quarter both interestbearing and noninterestbearing deposit volumes are lower than the elevated levels in december we expect that the yields on our securities portfolio will continue to going down with lower ph reinvestment yields and therefore we expect net interest revenue to be down a little less than sequentially in the first quarter we expect that net interest revenue would stabilize later in the year if the forward curves remain stable and steepen a little the mix of deposits dont change significantly and as the impact of lower rates on the balance sheet become more fully incorporated into the results and just a reminder that approximately of the securities portfolio reprices each quarter we will continue to actively focus on growing deposits optimizing the mix between onand offbalance sheet offerings and being disciplined about pricing the fed actions to increase excess reserve should be helpful as theyve been historically correlated to the level of our deposits just to keep in mind that the relationship may not hold in the short run or in any given quarter we would expect that investment and other income would be between million to million per quarter for the year the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16jan2020 with regard to expenses todd spoke about the importance of consistently investing in technology we expect that the level of technology investment will be up from we can calibrate the pace of that investment if we need to this will lead our overall expenses for the full year of to increase by up to yearonyear excluding the notable items included is approximately basis point impact from accounting related to higher pension expense now keep in mind that the charge we took in the fourth quarter for severance reflects the actions that will take place over the year so we wont see the full run rate impact until and note that in the first quarter staff expenses will be impacted by the acceleration of longterm incentive compensation expense for the retirement eligible employees the impact of which will be similar to last year and will affect sequential expense growth at this point we currently expect the full year effective tax rate will be approximately and lastly on the regulatory front we are quickly entering this years ccar process and are awaiting next steps in the capital reform proposals we continue to be encouraged by the direction of the proposals being discussed but well all see the final outcome and impact when they are complete with that operator can you please open up the lines for questions question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of brian bedell with deutsche bank please go ahead brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks good morning guys just maybe just back on the expenses real quick if you i didnt see it in the press release the bifurcation between severance and litigation in the fourth quarter and then as we think about the expense trajectory into and even can you just talk about the investments in technology and how you expect that to reduce the structural cost base over the next couple years thomas p gibbons a interim chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp you want to take this michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah hey brian this is mike on the first piece we didnt disclose the exact number and the split between the two i think you can get a pretty good sense of the magnitude of the severance by looking at the staff expense and the difference versus the third quarter so that will probably give you a good sense of the magnitude there the bigger piece by far was severance in the number as you think about overall expenses as both todd and i mentioned we would expect to continue to invest even more this year than we did in and really its across a range of items both continuing to build out our the infrastructure that is important for operating our businesses were building new capabilities and youre seeing some of those get announced and released even over the last couple weeks and then theres a large chunk thats going into the efficiency agenda on the cost side as you suggested there the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16jan2020 and i think working with lester owens our head of operations weve got a very long list of those programs that were just clicking down the list and executing and as you can imagine the benefits of those continue to come in the pl over a period of time so well get some of them in and well get some of them as we exit into and ill just reinforce what todd said in his remarks you can see the benefits of those investments and efficiency agenda coming through the pl already as weve increased the technology spend significantly in and overall expenses are down and thats a result of that focus brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thats helpful thank you and then on clearing just on the actual clearing service fees of million just given the way the markets have moved in darts and the online brokerage industry at least had been pretty strong if you want to just i would have expected that line to be a little stronger in the fourth quarter on a sequential basis if theres anything that you can call out would maybe depress that and then maybe longer term you talked about within pershing in your ria strategy maybe what are your expectations of potentially picking up market share given the industry consolidation thats upon us here thomas p gibbons a interim chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp okay ill take some of it in terms of the yeah why dont i take the second piece in terms of the industry consolidation and how we kind of look at that i mean were a little different because pershing is more b2b and we serve brokerdealers and corporate iras and weve also kind of differentiated ourselves because we provided choice whether thats related to the open investment platform that weve got or the ability to integrate bestin class kind of front office system so our clients have the choice as far as that goes and i think that will in the long term be the preference right now the desire for choice seems to make it more of an opportunity what i mean by thats just the consolidation probably as we look at it makes it more of an opportunity theres a lot of interest in alternative providers and that just puts us in a better position as to the revenue growth i think were seeing some pretty decent positives there as we have won some meaningful new business that we are implementing mike i dont know if you have any michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah and i would just again brian on our revenue stream were not a commissionbased revenue stream and so most of the revenue that we see come through the clearing services fee line is not based on the number of transactions that are getting executed its actually a very small piece of the puzzle there so you wont see the same correlation between transaction activity in our revenue stream as you might with some of the online brokers thomas p gibbons a interim chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp but weve got a pretty strong pipeline there we continue to win new business we are differentiated on the institutional side with some of our capabilities and were investing on the advisor side both in the sales as well as the the sales team the branding as well as the technology that were deploying so we feel pretty good about the business the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16jan2020 brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thanks very much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of brennan hawken with ubs please go ahead brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my questions i just wanted to ask a couple first on expenses you guys guided to an expense growth of or less so is the expectation that youre going to be able to deliver operating leverage and therefore you expect there to be a revenue growth picture thats going to be at least maybe a little greater and can you help us understand why theres such a big delay on the severance benefit thanks thomas p gibbons a interim chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah thanks brennan ill take the start of that and then mike can provide a little more color in terms of the environment delivering positive operating leverage is really going to be driven by revenue mix as much as anything right now as we continue to make investments in the technology that we think will have longer term benefits to us so i think it would be its certainly not impossible but challenged in the very near term ph i dont know if mike michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah look and i do think though brennan once you get through the nir stabilization we feel very confident still in the model where a little bit of revenue growth drives a significant amount of earnings growth and so we think thats still we feel very confident that that still holds and once nir stabilize which as i mentioned we think under the assumptions i gave you we think that happens later this year then you should start to see some of that come back into the picture brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc great thats fair and on that point mike there was some encouraging signs here on the noninterestbearing deposits can you talk a little bit give us a little more color on trends there in that line this quarter and how sustainable should we i know you i think you said that theyre down from december levels which is probably pretty seasonally typical but like with the interest rates coming down in the market are those trends now like more durable some stability there and maybe even some growth and do you have some deposit efforts specifically intended to help support growth in that line as well michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah look i think ill start on the last piece and try and make sure i hit all your points but weve been as i said in my script weve been focused on this for a while now and that includes going after opportunities where theres noninterestbearing deposits and part of the episodic activity that we saw in the fourth quarter was very targeted activity that we go after related to escrow as an example where theres some significant transactions there its hard to predict when theyre going to come and how theyre going to come but its an intentional act on our part to go out and target those opportunities the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16jan2020 as you think about the path forward i think the macro environment certainly should be helpful and were encouraged by the level of dialogue and the activity were seeing and well have to let it play out a little bit longer to call a sustainable trend i think thomas p gibbons a interim chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah and you guys have picked up on the correlation to the feds balance sheet and the impact that its likely to have on us and that could be somewhat on the positive and then the rest of it is going to be also rate driven so if theres a change in the rate environment it could potentially move in that category as well brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay thanks for the color operator thank you our next question comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning thomas p gibbons a interim chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc todd at the beginning you highlighted a variety of areas that should be able to deliver growth i wondered if you could give us a sense as to what is the most important one or two areas that youre looking for to deliver growth this year and im asking the question in part to understand the context for the investment spend and where its most critical for you thomas p gibbons a interim chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp okay well i think the investment spend is kind of coming across the board so were spending mike talked a little bit about just building a stronger and stronger infrastructure for resiliency which just provides an increase in the quality of our services we are investing in integrating thirdparty capabilities which i think is a bit of a differentiator we are investing in improving operations and were starting to see the positive feedback from that and the scorecards that our clients keep on us the most important thing is to retain business and by providing great service and covering and increasingly better capabilities around that service its difficult for clients to leave in terms of initiatives that might drive future revenue so really kind of three or four areas where im most focused one is the things that weve talked about in the clearing and collateral management clearance and collateral management so we are building an interoperable triparty system which we think will make our clients much the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16jan2020 more effective in managing their collateral globally and as a result we can pick up some of the global market share and also provide some of those services to those traditionally ph whove been in the buy lot space thats all thats probably another year or two before i think that really that kicks in but were starting to see some of the benefits from that now one of our other focus area is around data and analytics and i think this is going to be an increasingly competitive advantage for us as we build we currently with the under eagle have approximately trillion of assets under management eagle is the other brand name of our data and analytics capability as weve built on that platform and what we call the data vault we think weve got an exciting capability where we will see growth this year and will provide the ability to do for our clients to do deep analysis around the structured data thats on our platform were investing in our wealth management platform thats more longterm as well and weve already talked a little bit about the investments that were making at pershing so id say those four are in terms of business growth are where my key focus is betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay thats help michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah no i think i think id echo what todd said on the bigger priorities but i think the good part is that each of the business we really do feel that each of the businesses still have some opportunity to grow some of them require a bigger investment some of them require smaller investment and so i think were focused really on each of them to make sure we get we take advantage of those opportunities betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thanks and then mike for you specifically or todd can chime in too but on the capital you highlighted that the slr under the new rule will be up i think to what or or something like that i know ive asked in this call many times about press and what your intentions are there now that we have the final rule set in maybe you could speak to what opportunities you have to become a little bit more capital efficient there and not sure if it has to wait until the ccar given where the slr came in michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah look i think slr as you know betsy is one piece of the puzzle in terms of the rules that are being discussed and contemplated and so i think we really do need to look at all of the rules that are still a work in process around stress capital buffer and all the related pieces of it before we have a complete picture on how were going to optimize the capital stack betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and is it better to michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16jan2020 indiscernible betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah and is it better to do a call of the ph prep or is it better to utilize the full capital stack you have in increasing the balance sheet size for example for sponsored repo michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp well for sponsored repo that doesnt have any impact on the size of our balance sheet and so to take advantage of opportunities like that we dont need to we dont need capital to do that betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc indiscernible michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp so i think look i think were going were going to look at all of the options to figure out what our opportunity is on the revenue side to grow and keep the balance sheet where it is or grow the balance sheet and were going to look at our opportunities given the new capital rules and i think youll hear more from us on that as ccar and stress capital stuff comes into focus hopefully over the next few months thomas p gibbons a interim chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah its a its a little bit challenging because we just dont know exactly what the rules are going to be we do lots of different things and we obviously follow all discussions but at this point we just dont have enough precision to say what the actual impact is going to be to us betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay all right do you think youre going to get that at ccar indiscernible michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp who knows i think thats the honest answer i think the i think were all going to find out when the rules come out on ccar how much of how much of it is clear and then well see as they finalize the notice of rule the nprs that theyve got out there thomas p gibbons a interim chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp its a lot michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah yeah the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16jan2020 thomas p gibbons a interim chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp to get done for a short period of time michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah okay all right appreciate it thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of alex blostein with goldman sachs please go ahead alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning everybody so just a couple followups so one i guess on expenses mike maybe just to clarify the base for what you guys are talking about expense growth is about billion kind of the core number that you reported in michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah yeah its whats in the press release on page alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc yeah and then when you talk about the tech spend you guys had billion or so in i just want to make sure is that all running through the income statement and again sounded like that was a growth in how much of a growth rate do you guys expect to see there for basically just kind of trying to get a flavor for how much you need to reengineer in savings to keep the overall expenses below the range michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah i think look most of its running through the pl already alex so for so most of its going through the pl so i think were not i dont think weve given you the exact percentage increase thats going to go up but were continuing to deliver consistent efficiency gains as we go and as you and i and others have talked about over time like we still think theres a long road ahead of efficiencies that we can generate through these investments were making so we feel pretty confident that were going to be able to get at those over the next couple of years alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16jan2020 all right and my second question around the asset management business so when i look at the flow dynamics fixed income ldi was a little light this quarter again despite what has been a really strong trend in the industry and then cash management also i think had some outflows can you provide a little bit of color kind of whats been driving that and then the market performance also a sizably negative number which obviously is surprising given what the market has done so maybe kind of help flush out whats driven both the flows and the market delta this quarter michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah i think on ldi its not going to be a straight line up as you think about flows in that business and theres been lots happening in the uk pension market that made people make sure they were thinking about how to manage their liabilities in the right way and we feel really good still about the pipeline and the unfunded commitments that weve got in that business in the uk plus theyve been continuing to invest in bringing their capabilities outside of that of their core market so i think we still feel good about the ldi space we feel good about what theyre doing performance has been good and so we dont really have any concerns in the ldi space really at all and as you know just more broadly about our asset management business its largely institutional set of clients and so youre going to have some chunky flows from time to time for various reasons as you look at any given quarter and so theres nothing underneath the fixed income side that i would point to that is a core issue or core trend that were concerned about thomas p gibbons a interim chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp well then you had also had a question around market i think one of the things to keep in mind we have a fairly substantial exposure to the uk where the currency impacts and the equity impacts are a little bit different than it would have been domestically so thats one thing i was drawing there in terms of the cash i would say thats a little disappointing and i think we need to work to do a little better there alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it great thanks very much operator thank you operator instructions well next to the line of brian kleinhanzl with kbw please go ahead brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah good morning quick question on the deposit optimization that you talked about just trying to get a sense of how far along you are in that process it sounds like you did that over the course of or is it like theres still a long runway to deposit optimization from here michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16jan2020 yes i think brian its were continuing to optimize so i think the this is a dialogue that is a very granular conversation with clients and its a clientbyclient dialogue and so i think weve made some progress but weve got more to go to continue to make sure that were optimizing the pricing and footprint weve got there so brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then separately is there any way ph you can give an update on how the aladdin offering is moving forward theres still some concern across the industry whether or not proprietary versus thirdparty solutions is the way its moving do you have any update there thanks thomas p gibbons a interim chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp sure weve been building on a number of partnerships over the past six to nine months and id say theyre really coming in two flavors the first is where is the ones that youre referring to is where weve connected with some of the leading order management systems aladdin bloomberg and simcorp many of our mutual clients already have signed up and many are in the process of signing up so weve got a very high success rate where weve got common clients the other thing that its doing for us is its opening doors for other conversations where we see our clients able to gain efficiencies because of this so i think right now the benefits that were seeing is its initiating discussions opening doors and giving us more opportunities to bid on new business and secondly its strengthening the relationships with the businesses that weve already got because it is integrated it is single signon the client is able to look down into their custody activity near real time i think theres the real benefits to our clients that are paying off and i mentioned that theyre really as we think through the partnerships theyre really coming in two flavors the other type is everything that we are doing with fintechs and so weve announced quite a few just this week we announced one where were working with the fintech to provide independent alternative navs for funds so this provides both an oversight function and it enhances the control and in addition it serves as a contingency if there were a problem in construction of the nav so weve partnered with them some of our clients have actually looked to use them but they found the implementation would have been too difficult and so by partnering with them implementing we gain scale from doing that as well as providing it as a service rather than just as a piece of software so were pretty excited thats already attracted quite a bit of attention this week brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah thanks operator thank you our next question comes from the line of robert wildhack with autonomous research please go ahead robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research good morning guys just wanted to ask a question on the balance sheet and the impact of the fed injecting reserves into the system are you seeing significant impact there and either way how long until we can kind of see that play out in the numbers thanks the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16jan2020 thomas p gibbons a interim chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp indiscernible its so difficult robert for us to be able to identify any single particular incident on a day today basis or even but if you just look back at historical trends and you look at the balance sheet and you look at the feds balance sheet and you look at our balance sheet related to deposits youll see that there is a correlation but ph depicting why that took place whether it was a money market fund that decided ph theyll need a little extra cash and to capture anything like that is very very hard to determine ph theres still a lot of it do you have anything to add to that mike michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp no robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research thanks i think thats all i had thomas p gibbons a interim chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp okay thanks robert operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of vivek juneja with jpmorgan chase please go ahead vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi todd hi mike thomas p gibbons a interim chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp good morning michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp good morning vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc two questions which businesses need the most tech catchup ph if you can aim at talking from a business standpoint i know youre spending in a lot of different areas lot of ph business to do where do you think you need to do so more either from a competitive standpoint or a business need can you give some sense of because youve got obviously a lot of businesses thomas p gibbons a interim chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16jan2020 yeah i actually think we are in pretty good shape what were trying to do vivek is kind of get ahead of the game and if you think about some of the things that were doing i just walked through a whole list of partnerships and kind of differentiated in capabilities and this willingness to integrate with bestinclass were not always going to be able to deliver the best application and we want to provide our clients flexibility so that holds when we look at pershing it holds when we look at asset servicing weve made some very good investments in our corporate trust business and were starting to gain back market share we had lost a little market share over the years i like where we are in wealth management i think we can continue to do better there so i think this is a matter of trying to break out not catchup vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah is there any room to improve the efficiency of tech spend what we hear from others is theyre trying to flatten it shift the mix of what theyre spending on youre hearing from competitors and peers of yours is there room for you to do that and if not when can we start to see that flatten up michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp hey vivek its mike i think todd highlighted a little bit of that in his script where we are as focused about driving efficiency in our technology spend as we are anywhere else in the company and we reduced the number of apps by theres another coming so its over a reduction of our apps and as we make these investments in the underlying infrastructure and application it makes the next set of investments we want to make that much more efficient cheaper faster and so its something youre already seeing in the spend that were making vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc so do you have a range or something on operating margin where you think you can get to with all of this tech spend as we look out a year or two michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah we havent given you a view on goforward operating margins vivek but as i said earlier i think as we get through the short term and medium term on net interest revenue we do feel confident that the model still holds where well be able to deliver for a little bit of revenue growth a pretty significant amount of earnings growth and i think that implies expansion in operating margin at that point so i think i would just model that way i think the guide we gave you a while ago now at investor day a couple years ago is probably a good way to think about it still vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc one last one for you mike your reverse repo yields fell pretty sharply the one that the way you have it on the balance sheet the lowest level weve seen in five quarters how should we think about that is michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16jan2020 the fed reduced rates vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc that drop michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah the fed reduced rates and the september the peak in reverse repo spread in september didnt happen again those two drivers thomas p gibbons a interim chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp i know you like to do the arithmetic there vivek but we look at that since its novated down the size matters the spread matters and then the overall rate matters ultimately were generating a spread thats been novated down that spread has been weak and weaken consistent but in the third quarter we saw the spike with an unusual activity in the repo market vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi you mentioned retiring apps youve retired more to go whats the total number of apps that you have and i dont think this is completely related but what percent of apps on desktops are webbased versus having old versions that could support them thomas p gibbons a interim chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp im going to turn this one over to mike mike but in terms of the we dont disclose the total number of apps i dont believe weve disclosed michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp no thomas p gibbons a interim chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp total number of apps that weve got but weve obviously got a pretty careful inventory of those apps and part of what were doing in our resiliency buildout in infrastructure investment is also making ourselves more efficient by being able to sunset ph or eliminate some of these applications and so im pleased that were down the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16jan2020 probably closer to now and weve got another or so that wed probably take out over the course of the next to months so i cant really get into the specifics of where those apps are in terms of what base michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah mike im not i think that im not sure thats the right way to think about it not all modern apps are web based apps but i think you should assume that many of the tools that our folks are using are always getting better and were always investing in those and that gets we have every weekend of the year theres something thats being rolled out across our product suite through either internal folks or external folks and that improves the way they work so indiscernible thomas p gibbons a interim chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah in terms of productivity tools we are rolling out processing the cloud version of microsofts office and one of the things that were also doing is our operations we get over million client email queries each year and we are developing ai around making that much more productive and responsive in responding to it so were continuing to invest a lot in productivity and the infrastructure build that we have that were making i think will help us do that as well mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then just one followup so just generally speaking you said youre spending more in technology what was that billion going up to what number im not sure if you said that if you are willing to do so and when do you think that turns like if you if we think of it going down the jcurve when do you come up the other side with these investments is that like a year or three years or five years thomas p gibbons a interim chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp let me make one comment and mike can get into more of the details as weve really picked up the tech spend over the past three years i would say the rate has come down slightly although the total amount continues to go up because its not a little bit of a bigger base but rate of growth has probably come down i dont know mike if you want ph us to really the jcurve as you can think through how quickly we amortize infrastructure michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah i mean look mike i think the the way we think about the tech spend is its not a were shooting to spend a certain number what were doing each year is looking at how much can we actually execute what are the business cases how do we think about like the return were going to get on them and most importantly like can we successfully execute it and do we have people in place to do it and i think thats driving and thats going to be the constraint that weve got in most years is making sure that we can execute it well and i think right now we feel its important to continue to make those investments because thats whats going to differentiate us going forward and keeping in mind that weve got to deliver bottomline on bottomline as well and so were trying to find the balance there to make sure that were doing the right thing by all of our stakeholders and so thats the way we go about how much were going to spend in any given year the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16jan2020 thomas p gibbons a interim chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah so that a really good point so as we look out to next year i dont want to predict this because if theres not an roi on the total spend well bring it down but right now we believe there is mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you thomas p gibbons a interim chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thanks mike michael santomassimo chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp all right looks like thats the last question thank
