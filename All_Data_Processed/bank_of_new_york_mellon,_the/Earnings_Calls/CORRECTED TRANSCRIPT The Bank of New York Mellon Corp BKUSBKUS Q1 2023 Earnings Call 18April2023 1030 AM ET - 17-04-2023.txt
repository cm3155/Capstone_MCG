president director the bank of new york mellon corp thank you marius and good morning everyone before i turn the call over to dermot to review our financial results i want to provide some broader perspective and an update on how were serving our clients stepping up as a firm in this complex environment following a relatively benign start to the year markets were quite unsettled in march when we saw two prominent bank failures in the united states and a government broker distressed bank takeover in europe while things have calmed down somewhat over the past couple of weeks after over a decade of zero interest rate monetary policies the risks and uncertainty associated with the fights against inflation higher interest rates and quantitative tightening together with geopolitical tensions remain elevated and domestically we continue to march closer to another debt ceiling standoff against this backdrop its a healthy reminder that the strength of bny mellons highly liquid lower creditrisk and wellcapitalized balance sheet in combination with the resilience of our platforms is the bedrock that supports our client franchise the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2023 for nearly years weve built up a legacy of client and industry trust rooted in our resiliency through good times and bad weve been a port in the storm for our clients in periods of stress over that time and recent weeks have been no different as weve helped our clients to navigate the volatility in markets with our strong balance sheet and broader liquidity solutions after seeing deposit balances increase following recent market events we ended the quarter slightly higher than where we started it and our broader liquidity platform which manages over trillion worth of cash and other shortterm investment options on behalf of our clients has seen growth across most channels but more broadly the recent events have led to concern around the health and stability of some banks as theyve highlighted the critical importance of robust asset and liability management for all financial services participants as one of the largest banks in the united states and as a gsib we are held and we hold ourselves to a high standard including stringent capital liquidity and stress testing requirements on capital unrealized losses related to our availableforsale investment securities portfolio are already reflected in our capital ratios we have consistently maintained the majority of our investment securities portfolio as availableforsale and as you will recall weve had a view for a while now that rates would be a little higher in their terminal rate than the market has been pricing in and so over the last yearandahalf we meaningfully reduced the duration and enhanced the risk and liquidity profile of the portfolio together these actions provide us with ample flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions as we move through the year and on liquidity our robust liquidity management framework includes risk metrics such as concentration limits and daily liquidity stress testing protocols that go beyond regulatory requirements it is these periods of stress that also showcase our characteristic resilience and the power of our diversified and lowerrisk business model we primarily serve large institutional clients who collectively maintain substantial deposit balances with us as part of the services we provide to support their business activities whether thats custody cash management clearing and corporate trust services as a result roughly twothirds of our deposit base is operational and sticky in nature and derived from a diverse set of business lines and as i mentioned earlier we manage over trillion of cash on behalf of our clients across deposits money market funds repos and securities lending which allows us to retain a connection to the money when it moves around various shortterm investment alternatives and were also the largest provider of collateral services globally our average triparty balances increased to trillion this quarter which is another example of just how comprehensive our role is in the broader liquidity ecosystem now turning to our financial performance in the quarter as you can see on page of our financial highlights presentation we delivered solid results we reported earnings per share of up yearoveryear or up excluding notable items primarily in the first quarter of last year revenue was up yearoveryear we closely managed expenses up yearoveryear and we generated a healthy return on tangible common equity of and given how in focus capital and liquidity are at the moment ill note that our tier leverage ratio as well as our liquidity coverage ratio remains strong and unchanged compared to the prior quarter well above regulatory requirements and our own management buffers the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2023 stepping back for a moment im encouraged by the early progress that we are seeing around the company to deliver on the commitment that we made to you back in january first we are bending the cost curve our first quarter expense growth came in marginally better than our initial internal plan and we remain firmly committed to cutting our core expense growth by roughly half this year compared to on a constant currency basis second in line with our outlook for the year we continued to derive healthy growth in net interest revenue third we delivered positive operating leverage on a yearoveryear basis and fourth we returned a meaningful amount of capital to our shareholders including billion of common share repurchases weve made good initial progress on our plan to return more than of earnings to shareholders in and we currently expect to continue buying back stock albeit at a slower pace given the uncertain environment at the same time ive made a promise to you to call it as it is when we fall short of our expectations and so to be candid our fees being flat yearoveryear was somewhat lackluster having said that there were a number of business highlights this quarter that are designed to help us change this trajectory and drive underlying fee growth over time and so ill call out a few in asset servicing the pipeline remains strong and the margin on new deals is improving as were increasingly holding the line on price to drive more profitable growth in the business etf activity is up across all measures with healthy increases in auca orders and flows and wins with alts and in our data platform services business were pleasing to see this quarter in january we announced the launch of our outsourced trading business powered by a platform that already executes more than trillion in volumes annually for our investment management business this global multi asset trading service can help clients to reduce their costs and focus on alpha generation while still early days we think there is significant opportunity here to offer front office trading capabilities in a trusted unconflicted way to the market pershing brought in a healthy billion of net new assets during the quarter representing midsingledigit organic growth on an annualized basis and total revenue was a quarterly record as part of bny mellon clients recognize pershing as a source of strength and stability in the marketplace in the current environment clients also appreciate the flexibility and choice of our product offering meanwhile our pershing x team continues to make great progress as we aim for a broader rollout this summer just last week we announced a collaboration with snowflake to provide our prospective pershing x clients with more powerful analytics and faster data management improving their digital experience so they can operate more efficiently clearance and collateral management activity remained elevated given the volatility in the market and as dealers increasingly finance larger inventories via triparty we continue to see growth from the investments that weve made to increase market connectivity by expanding our triparty platform into new markets across asia and emea and into new trade types and collateral pools reinforcing our role as the only truly global provider of collateral management treasury services delivered broadbased client wins across us dollar digital and fx payments liquidity and trade finance products and also saw a nice pickup in account and operational deposit growth towards the end of the quarter the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2023 in investment and wealth management although our investment performance remained solid aum flows were mixed with strength in fixed income and ldi strategy partly offset by outflows in other longterm strategies during the quarter our uk investment manager newton launched five futurelegacy funds its first range of risk rated sustainable multiasset funds to support growth in the uk retirement market and back in the us the dreyfus bold share class which we introduced last year has now raised over billion in aum in summary over the past few months ive spoken about our combination of client trust atscale platforms client focused culture and resilience as a powerful foundation on which we can build im also proud that our culture has been front and center in recent weeks as our people have risen to the occasion responding commercially and working tirelessly to enable successful outcomes for our clients in these uncertain times i view this clientfirst culture as the key to make more out of our diversified portfolio of adjacent businesses while we are the worlds largest custodian and a trust bank the contributions from clearance and collateral management pershing treasury services and issuer services are differentiating in our client value proposition with that let me officially welcome dermot to his first earnings call dermot over to you dermot william mcdonogh chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp thank you robin for the introduction and good morning everyone its a privilege to be here and i look forward to working with you all ill start on page of the presentation with some additional details on our consolidated financial results in the first quarter total revenue was billion up yearoveryear this reflects fee revenue being flat as headwinds from lower market value a stronger dollar and the sale of alcentra which closed in november last year were offset by significant improvement in fee waivers and the absence of a notable item last year related to russia firmwide assets under custody andor administration of trillion increased by yearoveryear growth from new and existing clients more than offset the stiff headwinds from lower market values and currency translation a real testament to the strength and diversification of our franchise quarteroverquarter assets under custody andor administration increased by assets under management of trillion decreased by yearoveryear here the impact of lower market values and the stronger dollar was tempered by cumulative net inflows over the months quarteroverquarter assets under management increased by investment and other revenue was million and included another strong quarter of fixed income trading on the back of elevated volatility and greater demand for us treasuries and net interest revenue increased by yearoveryear primarily reflecting higher interest rates expenses were up driven by higher investments and revenuerelated expenses partially offset by efficiency savings and the impact of the sale of alcentra the impact of inflation and merit increases were largely offset by the favorable impact of the stronger dollar and the provision for credit losses was million in the quarter reflecting changes in the macroeconomic forecast the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2023 as robin mentioned earlier earnings per share were up yearoveryear or up excluding notable items largely in the first quarter of last year our reported pretax margin was and our return on tangible common equity was the highest in three years turning to capital and liquidity on page our tier leverage ratio which continues to be our binding capital constraint was essentially flat quarteroverquarter and our cet1 ratio was the strength of our balance sheet and our healthy earnings generation in the quarter allowed us to return billion of capital to our common shareholders including billion of common share repurchases while maintaining our capital ratios well above regulatory minimum and above our more stringent management target similarly on liquidity our liquidity coverage ratio was also unchanged compared with the prior quarter the strength of our highly liquid lower creditrisk and wellcapitalized balance sheet is one of the cornerstones of our franchise starting in late2021 and throughout we proactively reduced the duration and enhanced the risk and liquidity profile of our investment securities portfolio while consistently keeping over of the book availableforsale to position ourselves with ample flexibility for changing market and interest rate conditions between the beginning of this year and early march we saw deposit balances decline in line with typical seasonal patterns and in line with our expectations considering continued central bank tightening by both rate hikes and quantitative tightening this was followed by a swift increase in deposit balances as clients sought the strength of our balance sheet during the recent turmoil in the banking sector we ended the quarter with deposit balances up sequentially on a periodend basis but we expect continued moderation of deposit levels in the months ahead now moving on to net interest revenue and further details on the underlying balance sheet trends on page which i will describe in sequential terms net interest revenue of billion was up quarteroverquarter this sequential increase reflects higher yields on interestearning assets partially offset by higher funding costs and the impact of balance sheet size and mix while this is clearly a very volatile quarter in rates markets it is worth noting that on average realized rates were in line with our projections for the quarter our outperformance compared to our prior expectations was primarily driven by slightly lowerthanexpected deposit betas on a quarterly average basis deposit balances decreased by sequentially noninterestbearing deposits represented of total deposit balances which continues to be above our longterm range of to based on historical averages in normal interest rate environment average interestearning assets decreased by quarteroverquarter underneath that cash and reverse repo was flat loan balances were down and our investment securities portfolio was flat moving on to expenses on page expenses for the quarter were billion up yearoveryear as mentioned earlier this reflects investments in higher revenuerelated expenses partially offset by efficiency savings and the impact of the sale of alcentra the impact of inflation and merit increases was largely offset by the favorable impact of the stronger dollar robin has been clear about our determination to bend the cost curve were executing with discipline and urgency as you can see signs of our delivery in our professional legal and other purchase services net occupancy and business development lines we feel good about our progress in the first quarter and how it positions us for efficiency savings in the coming quarters to help us meet our goal for the year the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2023 turning to our business segments lets start with securities services on page as i discussed the performance of our securities services and market and wealth services segments i will comment on the investment services fees for each line of business described in our earnings press release and the financial supplement securities services reported total revenue of billion up yearoveryear fee revenue was up within this fx revenue was down as the benefit of higher volatility was more than offset by a decline in emerging market volumes and net interest revenue was up in asset servicing investment services fees decreased by the benefit of lower money market fee waivers and net new business was more than offset by the impact of lower market values lower client activity and the stronger dollar in issuer services investment services fees increased by this increase largely reflects the absence of the notable item last year related to russia as well as lower money market fee waivers in corporate trust next market and wealth services on page markets and wealth services reported total revenue of billion up yearoveryear fee revenue was up and net interest revenue increased by in pershing investment services fees were up primarily driven by the abatement of money market fee waivers partially offset by lower client activity net new assets were a healthy billion in the quarter and average active clearing accounts were up yearonyear in treasury services investment services fees decreased slightly by driven by higher earnings credits on noninterestbearing deposit balances on the back of higher interest rates partially offset by lower money market fee waivers and net new business and in clearance and collateral management investment services fees were up largely reflecting higher us government clearance volumes amid continued demand for us treasuries moving on to investment and wealth management on page investment and wealth management reported total revenue of million down yearoveryear fee revenue was down investment and other revenue was million in the quarter primarily reflecting seed capital gains as opposed to losses in the first quarter of last year and net interest revenue was down yearoveryear assets under management of trillion decreased by yearoveryear as i mentioned earlier this decrease largely reflects lower market values and the unfavorable impact of the stronger dollar partially offset by cumulative net inflows in the quarter we saw billion of net inflows into longterm products we continued to see healthy net inflows into our ldi strategies of billion and we also saw billion of net inflows into our fixed income strategy in cash while we expected outflows from a small number of clients this was offset by healthy inflows on the back of our continued strong investment performance in investment management revenue was down yearoveryear this decrease reflects the impact of the sale of alcentra the mix of cumulative net inflows lower market values and the stronger dollar and was partially offset by lower money market fee waivers in wealth management revenue was down driven by lower market values and changes in product mix client assets of billion was down yearoveryear primarily driven by lower market values page shows the results of the other segment ill close with a few comments on how were currently thinking about our financial outlook for the year which in short remains basically unchanged from our earnings call in january you will recall that based on market the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2023 implied forward interest rates at the end of last year we projected an approximately yearoveryear increase in net interest revenue for the full year as you all know we continue to see significant volatility in rates markets and marketimplied forward interest rates currently suggest some meaningful fed easing relative to the dot plots we have positioned ourselves for continued interest rate volatility and retain ample flexibility and liquidity to respond to a wide range of outcomes as the ultimate impact of continued tightening remains uncertain were off to a good start in the first quarter and based on marketimplied forward interest rates at the end of march we still believe our outlook for yearoveryear growth in net interest revenue is realistic with some skew to the upside we also still expect expenses excluding notable items to be up yearoveryear assuming foreign exchange rates at the end of last year or by approximately on a constant currency basis as we said on our earnings call in january we are determined to deliver some positive operating leverage this year we still expect an effective tax rate in the to range and finally as we calibrate the amount and pace of our continuing share repurchases in the weeks and months ahead we will be mindful of the continued uncertainty in the operating environment especially as it relates to the uncertain path of interest rates and so were planning to maintain our current more conservative capital buffers for the time being so to wrap up were pleased with the companys solid financial performance in the first quarter which amid a challenging operating environment once again showcase the strength and resilience of our business model as we look forward we are continuing to manage our balance sheet conservatively and we are confident that we are well positioned to help our clients navigate the elevated uncertainty in global markets with that operator can you please open the line for qa the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2023 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks guys welcome dermot to follow up on your nii you reiterated perhaps a little upside obviously with a good start to the year that implies a sequential slide as the year goes through can you just help us understand how that works through in terms of what youre expecting for deposit trends and liability costs as you look through to that dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp okay good morning ken and thanks for the question before i answer id just like to acknowledge emily who was the former cfo and has been a tremendous partner with the transition and to the finance team and investor relations team who really helped me settle in well and its a real privilege to be here and i look forward to working with you all so on to your specific question around the mix between nii and deposits look back in january the environment was a little bit different to where it is today we feel weve had a very good start to nii we did a lot of scenario analysis in january to come up with that number and look there was a big divergence between the market implied forward curve which we use to budget and project where we think nii is versus where the fed is in the dot plots if you look at it today theres a little bit more of a coming together of that and theres more of a market color around higher for longer were positioned for that we feel good about it and as a consequence of that weve locked in a good quarter and we feel good about subsequent quarters and look the important thing in my remarks was skewed to the upside the range of outcomes is probably more uncertain today than it was in january we have the debt ceiling to come geopolitical uncertainty all the factors that you would know about and as a consequence i dont really want to update the guidance but feel were solid on with that skewed to the upside ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it great and just as a followup then can you maybe just flesh out a little bit how youre thinking about how the deposit trends go from here both in an absolute sense and then perhaps what that mix of ddas to total looks like from i think the that you posted this quarter thanks dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure so if you take a step back on deposits and think about coming out of the pandemic and as people started to focus on inflation and having better yield opportunities and you look at the system in total you see over the course of the last months across the industry deposits leaving the system were tracking that and were the same really as everybody else were down in terms of average deposits the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2023 and maybe if i doubleclick on what happened in the quarter a little bit up to march we were in line with our forecast which gave us the yearoveryear growth we had a blip to the upside for deposits in the latter part of march as a result of a little bit of the turmoil that happened there we saw a flight to our balance sheet people wanted to use our platform and so we saw deposits elevate now thats largely moderated albeit were a little bit above our forecast we expect that to moderate further like the rest of the industry in the coming quarters as our clients are sophisticated and they will look for yield but look i refer you to robins comments in his remarks where he talked about the cash ecosystem and we touch trillion of a cash ecosystem we want to point them to our products and services so while they may not use our deposit platform we want them to use other products within our ecosystem so we feel very good about where our deposit balances are and the trajectory for the rest of the year ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay great thanks again dermot and best of luck dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp thank you operator and our next question will come from steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp good morning steven steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so wanted to start off with just a question on some of the buyback commentary we saw a strong capital return in the quarter you noted plans to temper the pace of buyback was hoping to get some more context as to whats informing that decision if i think about some of the key inputs the leverage denominator should be shrinking albeit modestly given some of the deposit commentary you just cited you sounded more sanguine on basel iv youre less exposed to credit shocks it just feels like youre better placed than most to continue a healthy pace of buyback just want to understand the decision to retrench a bit in terms of the pace of deployment dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2023 thanks for the question steven i wouldnt use the word retrench i would just go back to january and just reaffirm what we said wed do which is return north of of earnings to our shareholders this year in  it was a total of billion of which million was dividends billion in share repurchases so a good start march came along and maybe some of it is me being a freshman cfo and wanting to just slow down the pace a bit to see how the macro environment plays out theres a lot of uncertainty out there i would reiterate we are going to continue to buy back but were just going to take it easy now and watch the situation day by day week by week if the situation clarifies itself if we get debt ceiling resolution there are a lot of things that play into the next couple of months and well watch and see and adjust accordingly steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so just to understand youre making adjustments but are you still committed to the payout or north of payout at least for the time being dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp thats correct steven steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc okay great and just for my followup on the topic of efficiency really encouraging to hear that youre doubling the efficiency savings this year i know you had highlighted that previously we saw some really nice progress in improving the securities services operating margin you talked about staying disciplined on managing cost there with the margin there above how quickly do you think you can get to that margin i wanted to understand what your plans are for the investment management segment in particular the pro forma the alcentra sale the margin there is fairly subdued just wanted to get some expectation around where you think that margin could potentially traject to over time what your plans are in terms of efficiency if there are any for the investment management segment as well dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp okay so there were a few questions there so ill try and deal with them as best i can so if we zoom out for a second and look at the firm yeah margin with a rotce the highest in three years okay so margin good always want to improve and then you doubleclick into that and you go securities services going to the positive in there is emily was the cfo for a number of years and now i get to partner with her figuring out how to drive that margin higher and so we have a plan you will have noted that we committed to halve the expense growth yearover year were off to a good start and that will have that segment will be a beneficiary of that then you doubleclick into the next segment which is market and wealth services which is a margin which i have no problems as cfo with that long may it continue and then we go into investment and wealth management which margin is a bit to be honest its probably a bit disappointing but months ago that was a margin business and we dont see any reason why we cant get back there with a lot of hard work the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2023 there were quite a number of headwinds going into that last year lower market values a significant strengthening of the dollar and some of our clients wanted to do a bit of a mix shift from equities to fixed income and that was going from higher fee to lower fee but the important point that i would draw to you there is the clients stayed in our ecosystem and thats the key message clients are in our ecosystem and just mix shifting and were working with our clients to deliver good outcomes for them steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats great dermot thank you so much for accommodating the multiparters and welcome dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp thank you sir operator and our next question will come from alex blostein with goldman sachs alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning everybody thanks for the question i was hoping we can zone in on fees in investment services particularly within asset servicing and pershing at a macro level it feels like a lot of things have gone your way markets were up activity rates were very strong particularly in treasuries money market funds retail et cetera so all sort of things in your wheelhouse yet the revenues in both businesses were down sequentially so can you just unpack a little bit what were some of the offsets that drove to disappointment on fees and as you look out i guess for the rest of the year i think on the  call you guys made comments around just the overall firmwide fee growth for just wondering to get your latest thoughts on that thanks dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp hi alex hope youre well as a former colleague i think you were supposed to ask me an easy question not a hard question so look asset servicing the way i think about asset servicing is and look the headline number is down yeah that equates to a little over million yeah in the context of our quarter thats a small number so the way i think big picture again ive said this in the answer to other questions did we attract clients to our ecosystem yes and then within that its like how do we derive fee revenue from those clients some of it has to do with market levels some of it has to do with volume and some of it is other stuff like account opening so within that context we did see a riskoff sentiment from our clients wanting to pause push stuff out to subsequent quarters so the client volumes were down and so that really drove the asset servicing side of it and if you look at issuer services its a smaller number for us but thats a seasonal business and depository receipts is within that and  is typically a quiet quarter there and well expect that to pick up in  for dividend season and on the plus side for asset servicing we had higher market levels and we got some fees from that so overall i feel good about asset servicing we have to work hard on the fee outlook but its not i would say its not as negative as some commentators would portray the fee outlook to be as i see the situation today the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2023 as it goes to pershing look were very excited about the pershing business youll see from our commentary in our prepared remarks that we had billion onto our system robin talked about it in his prepared remarks were very excited about pershing x the partnership with snowflake were going to do a lot of great stuff in that area and we will tell you about it as the quarters unfold but pershing and pershing x is very very exciting for us alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got you thanks maybe as a former colleague an easier question on the followup i guess as you sort of think about the dynamics in the banking space over the last month month and a half and sort of the disruption that thats created and some of the opportunities that you guys might see on the back of that whether its retaining some of the deposits that came over or some new areas within the fee side of the equation where do you think you could lean into most to gain extra share robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp look alex ill start there look i think the events of march have really shown the importance of asset liability management as a key discipline and so whether you start on the asset side and think about tailoring your liabilities accordingly or you start on the liability side and make sure that youve got the right duration of assets and the right composition of assets that to me is lesson number one im sure well see a bunch of outcomes from that from policymakers over time as that all gets digested were in the preparedness business not the predicting business and that goes to everything across the franchise and we positioned ourselves well for this and we positioned ourselves so that we would be able to deal with lots of different eventualities and critically to your question that we could help clients through those various different eventualities and so were proud of the fact that we served as a little bit of a port in the storm for some of our clients weve had a lot of net new accounts opened in various angles on the business and i think its reaffirmed for us and we said this before that resiliency is a commercial attribute we spend a lot of money on resiliency we spend money in terms of making sure that our technology systems are stateoftheart all of the investment that weve made over the course of the past few years our investment in cyber but its also investment in the resiliency of our balance sheet and the combination of that allows us to then be able to use times like this to be able to attract clients to the platform dermot talked a bit more about that ecosystem which is another example which is we built the businesses over time and weve went into investments in those businesses that allow clients to be able to get what they need within our ecosystem even when they may be a little risk on they may be a little risk off they may favor deposits they may favor a money market fund they may favor equities they may favor fixed income but we have all of those cylinders if you will to the engine to be able to help our clients and we think that breadth and that diversification of the business which is built up over a period of time and which we have been leaning into is very very important i know we get described as a trust bank and by the way were proud of the trust that that moniker implies but remember that our most profitable highest growth highest margin segment of market and wealth services contains a set of businesses which you would not find in a trust bank the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2023 alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc totally agree all right thank you both operator and our next question will come from brennan hawken with ubs brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my question dermot welcome to the role looking forward to working with you a question on the nii reiteration dermot so previously there was an expectation that noninterestbearing deposits would get back to the historic to range is that still the case and can you maybe add a little color on why you think the noninterestbearing deposits have stayed above that range that weve seen in prior history is there a business mix shift change that has happened or any other structural reason which could cause it dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp thanks for the question brennan so like the way i think about it again is like i know ive said it a couple of times it really is nibs and bny mellon it really is an ecosystem point that i will start with clients leave and we dont lead with the deposit product clients come to our ecosystem for a range of products and they leave their cash with us to prosecute that business so ill pick out three examples like corporate trust nibs stay with us because they have to make coupon payments treasury services clients leave balances with us to offset fees asset servicing balances stay with us because of underlying client activity and then our clearance and collateral management business to mention another one we have decent nibs there so our businesses are bigger than a few years ago balances are bigger and clients are doing more with us so nibs are just attracted to the ecosystem so then you take a look at history and you do the bottomsup analysis and through the last cycle nibs did bottom out at the range currently were at were still at around the range it stayed sticky and i think our reason that you could ascribe to that is clients left cash with us in march because they just wanted to leave and use the safety and resilience of our balance sheet and just it stayed there and so in our forward outlook in terms of why we reiterate the guidance with the skew to the upside is we expect that to moderate not meaningfully but in line with our projection and the work that we did at the beginning of the year so we feel good about where it is at the moment we feel good about the forecast and its been stickier in the past than we projected it to be is how i would answer it robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp but were not relying on that stickiness and i think that is an important point that dermot mentioned and so to the extent that we are we will harvest the benefits as we have them but we definitely recognize that they could go down to the prior cycle lows in percentage composition terms and were managing ourselves accordingly the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2023 brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc yeah thats very very clear thanks for all that color robin you spoke to you actually said it very eloquently resiliency is a commercial attribute in the past youve spoken to the embedded position that bk bank of new york has as a counterparty how are you thinking about utilizing that position and that commercial attribute of resiliency in order to drive revenue do you have any additional color or commentary that you can provide on how youve been thinking about that robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp sure so look weve been quite careful over the course of the events of march to help our clients and to welcome clients into the ecosystem but we have not wanted to profit from the fact that theres been stress in the system and so thats obviously an important line and we participated as you know were one of the banks that participated in helping another key participant in the financial system with a large deposit and so we are very cognizant of our role in the system and the responsibility that we have to the system given the role that we play but at the same time over time we do view this resiliency to be a strong commercial asset so if you step back from the whole of bny mellon i think of ourselves as sort of offering a couple of things that are really differentiating one is this 239year history where we touch of the worlds investable assets we are the worlds largest custodian we are the worlds largest collateral manager we have that trillion worth of cash in the ecosystem we have another trillion worth of triparty thats trillion in total in that space largest depositary receipts firm number one in the brokerdealer pershing wealth management infrastructure space et cetera we have these terrific individual components and for us bringing them together and actually being able to demonstrate to our clients the breadth of the platform with the resiliency that we offer we think thats a winning combination and one that over time as ive talked about before we dont think weve taken full advantage of so it is telling this story of who we are our place in the world the roles that we play and helping our clients to realize just the breadth of activity that they can actually do with us and the fact that they can trust and rely on us brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc thanks for that color operator and our next question will come from mike mayo with wells fargo securities mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey dermot dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp hey mike good morning the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2023 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey well as you said to me at the annual meeting its a new country new firm and new job and so just pulling the lens out a little bit now that i can ask you a question specifically how do you approach the cfo job what skill set do you bring to the position i know emilys still there bigger and better but how might you look at things a little bit differently what kind of lens do you use and what are your objectives say over the next several years dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp okay so its interesting you asked the question mike when robin and i talked about the opportunity and when i decided to join i listened to the first earnings call after id made the decision to join and robin in his first as ceoapparent he talked about connecting the dots across the enterprise and hes just answered in the question that he just answered there he talked about that too and so in my prior life connecting the dots across the enterprise was a thing that i majored on i also grew up in the financial world and i intend hope and plan to bring financial discipline across the firm we have a great finance team here at bny mellon i couldnt be prouder of what they do and so i think about the role in three ways one is working with all of you clients regulators external stakeholders really delivering the message of what were about at bny mellon over the next several years so i view that as very important and then internally working with the executive committee and the rest of the leadership of the firm and the finance team to develop really good financial analysis in which we can make good strategic decisions about the way we want to take the firm and thats a lot of work but the team has already done a good job and look youre beginning to see the fruits of this come out in the expense area and other parts in terms of my top three priorities for this year it really is about slowing the expense growth of the firm weve made a commitment one quarter in were delivering on it and this is not about i dont think about it in some ways as expense cutting its like its attacking structural expense bases in the firm where we can think we really fundamentally believe we can do the same thing in just a better way and more efficiently and we want to invest and grow the firm so its i think about my expense priority as like how do i think about run the bank and how do i think about grow the bank because we really want to take those dollars that we get from efficiency and invest in things like pershing x and other really key growth initiatives so its all about financial discipline and giving the team the financial resources they need to grow the firm dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp and just managing the balance sheet which is a thing that weve had to do in the last couple of months quite aggressively mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc just one followup connecting the dots it makes sense you and robin both came from goldman sachs where theres the culture of connecting the dots its just the incentives to get people to connect the dots right breaking the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2023 down the barriers breaking down the silos and dont people just ultimately do what they get paid for and isnt that like a big tough task to change the incentive scheme to get people to connect the dots with each other robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp so if your question is does it take a lot of work and is it a big task to run a company differently than its been run before the answer is absolutely yes and we have got a leadership team who are very focused on approaching the next decade differently than the last decade and this point of connecting the dots is a very important one let me give you one example so dermot was talking about in our investment management business and he also mentioned pershing and so mike when you look at those two businesses just interestingly they couldnt have been run more separately within the ecosystem of bny mellon investment management was run as essentially almost a separate company off to the side pershing was run essentially as a different separate company off to a different side and we never really explored the opportunities to be able to think about the manufacturing of investment management with the fact that we have across pershing and wealth management a trillion distribution base now were an open architecture firm and so we arent distributing all of our manufactured product into our distribution arms but we have opportunity to explore that which frankly hasnt been fully explored up until now take the adjacency between margin where weve seen a significant growth for our collateral management business associated with new margin rules of uncleared margin exchanges need more efficient margin delivery those products are very adjacent to the rest of our collateral management business in triparty theyre also quite adjacent to our foreign exchange business theyre quite adjacent to our cash management ecosystem so we have both diversification in the firm but we also have a lot of natural adjacencies that people havent explored before so thats the way i think strategically about it and then your question is one of the several pillars of execution which is what are the things that we have to do to actually get after that some of those things are structural some of them are incentivebased some of them are peoplebased some of them are organizationalbased and so were going to approach all of those different pillars so that we ultimately attack that strategy effectively and were very committed to doing it mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp thanks mike operator and moving on to gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning gentlemen the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2023 robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc can you share with us robin around the debt ceiling thats coming up for this country what type of risks there are for your business if a debt ceiling isnt negotiated effectively by congress and the president can you what risk do you see in just that situation developing as we go forward robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp so first of all we obviously do play an important and somewhat special role as a market infrastructure provider in the space and we have a good vantage point on the operating of the treasury market we dont have a crystal ball though obviously in terms of how debt ceiling is going to get resolved and we do think of the fed and the treasury as clients of ours as well and we want a seamless experience as much as possible for them and also of course for our broader client franchise and so were really doing a couple of things number one we think its our responsibility to the system to lean in to the dialogue thats going on in dc in a way that can be helpful and so doing our bit for raising awareness sort of educating on various things debt ceiling breach is not the same thing as a government shutdown and making sure that that folks really understand what would happen and some of those consequences and so were spending time there we obviously spend time with the fed and the treasury on the topic as you would imagine and then internally really for the benefit of our clients were using all of the lessons learned from the past to update our playbooks were putting in automation on various different things and we are organized around being very ready to be able to execute come what may now of course were going to take a lot of guidance from the fed and the treasury on that as well as we go through it so there are a whole bunch of different things that we are doing i will also note that in the background our own iflow data which as you know we have quite good insights into market liquidity it shows that once again treasury market liquidity isnt great the market is a little bit less supported from foreign buyers we can see that from our iflow data and we all have access to the information on sort of offtherun versus ontherun bid offers etcetera and so its not great from a starting point which i think is a cautionary tale to the official sector that we really do want to try to get a good outcome on this thing gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good robin thank you and then dermot more of a technical question in your average balance sheet i think in the supplement its page can you share with us why is the fed funds sold yield so high and the same thing with the fed funds purchase the yields one in the first quarter and then the fed funds sold looks like its any particular reason why these seem to be out of line with the rest of the yields in the balance sheet dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2023 hey gerard i think thats largely a grossup netting issue but i will get marius to followup with you after the call and give you a more detailed explanation gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay yeah it just seems very odd to be so high okay i appreciate it thank you operator and well take a question from brian bedell with deutsche bank brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks good morning folks and welcome dermot looking forward to indiscernible maybe just to the growth outlook for can you guys hear me okay robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp you were breaking up for a second brian but i think youve come back brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc come back yeah im on my handset its much better than my headset okay just wanted to come back to the growth in pershing and asset servicing the revenue growth i heard you loud and clear on the drivers for as we think about the trajectory over the course of this year i guess two questions on this first of all did you benefit do you think from a revenue perspective in those areas on the fee side in march versus january february so just to get a sense of how volatility can help the revenue picture and then secondarily if you can talk about what you mentioned before in terms of connecting the dots if you will and how sort of quickly that can work its way into the revenue picture or is that much more of a longerterm goal and then ill do a followup question separately dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp okay so brian let me start with pershing so i would say in both businesses that you asked a question on  was it was predominantly a riskoff environment but notwithstanding the riskoff environment for pershing we attracted billion of new assets onto our system and so were growing organically at a nice clip which were very pleased about so i would say pershing feels good the outlook feels good and were going to do the launch official launch of pershing x in june and so the clients that are betatesting that feel good about what theyre seeing weve got the partnership with snowflake so i would say the outlook for that business overall in terms of our continued growth in assets and as a consequence of that notwithstanding the riskoff sentiment in  we believe being the number one in the market with brokerdealers and the several million active clearing accounts that we have on the system we feel pretty good about the future for that one asset servicing i think the way i would think about asset servicing is more steady as she goes yeah its a big business we have a mixtures like in the past people have talked of us as being a fixed income house and so i the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2023 would characterize it were both a fixed income house and an equity house and so twothirds of what comes in is largely fixed income related onethird equities and we continue to grow our auc and our aum and so over time that mix shift between fixed income and equities where they either play to our strengths or it will slow us down a bit so overall we feel like its a steady as she goes environment for asset servicing brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thats great color and then if i could just followup with the comments you made on the global multiasset trading capabilities similar question there is that something more nearterm or a little bit of a longerterm build out and is that coming in asset servicing or the fx and other trading line and then if i can sneak in on pershing x if youre rolling that out in june should we expect a revenue ramp contribution in the second half to that or again is that more of a longerterm build robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp so ill start with pershing x that is a longerterm build weve talked about the fact that it wasnt going to meaningfully contribute over the course of the first couple of years since we first talked about that and so thats really a thing you should expect essentially nothing from it in that period of time but well update as we go past launch well give you some updated view on that but i view that as being a story overall in terms of its ramp and again were still in beta testing we feel quite enthusiastic about the client response to the product but im going to reserve judgment until we start signing contracts and were launched live in the market on that in terms of outsourced trading so this is something that weve launched and we made the public launch during the quarter hence weve made the comment but this is a very medium longterm opportunity we talked before about the fact that as a firm we are very interested in crawling up the value chain of the various different businesses that we do in asset servicing once upon a time it was custody and then middle office got added and now data solutions get added and integration and these various different components that create a broader solution set for investment management and asset owner clients and now were adding to that and saying hey theres not actually a ton of alpha for an asset owner or investment manager particularly one that is managing in the tens or hundreds of billions of dollars of aum theres not a lot of alpha associated with execution the alpha is in portfolio construction asset selection but the actual buysell action isnt and in fact its not great scale because clients often need desks in multiple locations if theyre a multiasset asset manager they need lots of different specializations when it comes to the execution so we have all of that weve executed trillion or so a year of exactly that type of broadbased asset management execution for our own investment management firm and so now weve turned that into a platform that can operate not only for ourselves but also operate for clients were externalizing an existing atscale platform which is fully capable across products and were externalizing that now for clients and saying hey theres no real alpha for you associated with your own trade execution let us take it off your hands the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2023 and i view this also in a way as an extension of what we already do in foreign exchange where we do exactly that on a range of different execution basis for our clients in foreign exchange and so this is something that we know how to do and something that we already do now were externalizing it and i view it as quite an exciting evolution but its a very medium longterm thing as part of our overall journey on fee growth over time brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thats very interesting looking forward to hearing a lot more about that in the future thanks operator and our next question will come from robert wildhack with autonomous research robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research us lp good morning guys you called out the strong pipeline in asset servicing while holding the line on price and i wanted to unpack that a little more first how does the current backlog and velocity of new business compare to past periods and then second given that youre being disciplined on price what are the common elements that you think are driving your success here thanks robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp so this is part of our overall march to margin in the securities services business rob and so when we look at that dermots talked a little bit about the focus on the expense line thats important and it goes a little bit handinhand here if you look at our margin last year of now depending on last year or this years stat but if you just take this year stat we should be putting four times as much energy into the expense line as the revenue line in order to be able to get the same net effect at the bottom line and so were doing that but on the revenue line as well as driving new activities this discipline point pricing pressure is a normal part of this business but as we look back and we review certain deals that have been struck over the course of the past few years going back in some cases going back several years i think we did win in some cases on price and we look at and we now have new capabilities about reviewing the margin on a dealbydeal level and when we look at some of those deals were pretty disappointed so thats causing us to engage with those clients and talk to them about the other things that we would like to do for them that help us to be able to broadly improve the margin at a client level and then in some cases there have been deals and im thinking of one example in my mind of a client who came and they had a real expectation about pricing at a certain level and we were like were just not going to do the business at that level and we negotiated and we substantially increased the price to a level which we thought was appropriate for the actual business involved and look i dont know about the past how that would have happened but if i look at the history of deals that weve actually got on the platform my guess is that that behavior is not something that would have occurred before and therefore its yielded a different outcome so theres focus on the true cost to serve and then the standardization that needs to be done across the platforms that will improve and in fact reduce over time the cost to serve so even the same piece of business can be more profitable not only because were pressuring on price but also because were making it cheaper to actually execute that business and the trick will be doing both the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2023 dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah look the point i would add in there halving the growth rates and becoming more efficient as a company so all the work that we do on expenses and efficiency management feed into that discussion as well so you have to join the expense narrative again with the pricing good business narrative to get the complete picture robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research us lp thanks a lot guys and dermot welcome to the role dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp thank you sir operator and well take a question from vivek juneja with jpmorgan vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi thanks for taking my questions couple of clarifications robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp hey vivek vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi couple of clarifications the deposit inflows in march that you were talking about which businesses did you see that in dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp so i would say broadly speaking we saw it across the ecosystem the pointtopoint was up we finished the quarter on a periodend basis at billion our average for the quarter was i think roughly billion sic billion but there was no one business it really was broadly spread and i guess the important point that i would call out here is we made a strategic decision about months ago to centralize how we think about deposits into one platform so we think of deposits as a platform as well as a product and we have very very good client connectivity and engagement so when we talk about deposits we talk about it across the system and that will echo robins point about connecting the firm desiloing different businesses so we think of deposits as an enterprise effort and thats how it came together for us in the quarter vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2023 thanks and the flip side during this turmoil in march there was a lot of inflows into money market funds but when i look at your cash aum you had no for the quarter it shows no inflows any color on why you didnt benefit in that business also because youve historically been a big player in there dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp so yeah like i think and historically i would say and continue to be a very big player in that our performance in our dreyfus cash business has been excellent and continues to be excellent this year the simple answer to that question is we had some we knew in january we were going to have some known outflows so we were projecting to be slightly down in  and with the inflows as a result of what happened in march that got us back to flat so overall i think the average balances were higher but on a periodtoperiod basis were flat but we continue to feel very good about the business and more importantly performance and in this business performance matters so we expect that will youll see better balances going forward vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc and the outflows that youre talking about in january what was driving that is that pricing is that something else what drives that dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp it was clients wanting to do something else with their cash they told us that they were doing it it was in our forecast at the time we knew it was going to happen there was no specific reason robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp and ill just add on to that i think this quarter was a little idiosyncratic in a couple of different ways and last year we outgrew the market in the dreyfus money market platform and sort of two other observations theres a little bit of composition that you have to look at under the hood on these institutional money market funds in terms of where the money is coming from was it really coming from sort of mega individual ultrahigh net worth or was it coming from actual institutional flows and so i think you have to look a little bit at that on a money market fund by money market fund basis as well and then as dermot pointed out the broader our broader connectivity to money market funds goes beyond our own money market funds and so we have this marketleading liquiditydirect product and so even when money goes to other money market funds we are benefiting from that because we have this connectivity and so we are a very large source of inflows to some of those other money market funds that youve seen growing and again this is the benefit of the ecosystem it might be on our balance sheet it might be on our money market fund it might be in someone elses money market fund it might be that were selling treasury bills to clients but all of those things are in the mix as is the repo and feds reverse repo facility vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2023 operator and well take a question from rajiv bhatia with morningstar rajiv bhatia q analyst morningstar inc research good morning thinking about operational interestbearing deposit versus nonoperational interestbearing deposits how much does the rate you pay differ between those two buckets robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp so we dont disclose the exact rates on the different components but let me just sort of broadly talk to you about the deposits rajiv because i think this is quite important so first of all to me the decision tree is not insured versus uninsured thats a convenience its sort of a retail expression its a shorthand that gets used in the market the ultimate decision tree is whether deposits are stable and sticky or whether theyre not and insured is just one lens of that and that lens is a bit more relevant to retail than institutional and by the way even within insured not all deposits are equally sticky right because youve got checking youve got highyield savings youre going to have different outcomes for these whether theyre true operational accounts even on the retail side but there are other types of sticky and stable and so for us twothirds of our deposits in the first quarter are operational across our portfolio of businesses and those are as dermot said earlier on those are required in order to be able to provide clients with those operational services and its diversified across our portfolio and you know custody cash management clearing corporate trust there are a bunch of different sort of business cylinders that give rise in that operational cash engine and we obviously spend a lot of time and effort modeling all of these types of things and sort of and weve seen that that is really proven to be stable over multiple cycles and so thats sort of why we focus so much on operational and then for nonoperational deposits look theres a little bit there associated with we dont expect them to leave but we plan for them to be able to leave at obviously at a much much higher rate than we would think about that on the operational side because we just think thats good asset liability management rajiv bhatia q analyst morningstar inc research okay and then just one followup in your prepared remarks you mentioned that wealth management revenues were down in part due to changes in product mix can you expand on what that is and whether you expect that to continue dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp so i think that just goes back to the point of the riskoff sentiment that we saw in  and people just wanting to a not do activity and move from fixed income products to equity products sic equity to fixed income products normal behavior nothing out of the ordinary that i would call out totally expected just us working with the clients to deliver the risk appetite that they wanted to have for that quarter the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2023 the turmoil of march is you would say for now may have a basis and we may see a change in client behavior but back when they took these actions in march we didnt know how long we were going to be in this situation for so its behavior that we expected to see and is i would view it as normal bau rajiv bhatia q analyst morningstar inc research all right thank you robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp thanks rajiv operator thank you and our last question will come from betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc oh hi good morning robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp hey betsy good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah okay just a couple of things one on the mmf discussion that you just had with vivek you also benefited from mmf through your custody platform as well right because you custody a lot of mmf is that fair robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah thats right we touch its another touch point with money market funds on the asset servicing side betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right okay and that helped the deposits im guessing so my question really has to do with your role as a global payment provider one of the top obviously and i think youre involved in the fednow pilot i just wanted to get a sense as to how youre thinking about how fednow is integrated within your global payments platform get an update on the bny mellon digital asset platform and is there anything thats going on within crypto that would have you lean in or out so three legs of that question thanks robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp okay so let me start with realtime we are part of the fednow test i think actually might have been the first bank to start testing on it we were the first bank to do a test on the clearing house realtime payment rails and look overall when i step back from realtime payments if i use that as the generic term that would cover the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2023 both fednow and the clearing house it is a couple of things it is a new payment rail and i think that represents an interesting disruption and we would like to participate in that disruption which is one of the reasons why weve been leaning in i think theres a bunch of opportunities for clients there quicker cheaper more control over the payments and so thats a good thing saves them dollars and ultimately its quite helpful for the industrys carbon footprint as well because its really a check should be over time a check eradicator and theres a lot of sort of carbon footprint and esg more broadly in the handling of checks so that would be a good thing weve got the opportunity to be part of that disruption because of our existing treasury services business and we see that also as part of a broader solution set because wrapped up in realtime payments theres payment validation theres fraud protection and there are other data services and we find ourselves selling that bundle more often than not when we sell rtp and i think we have a position you sort of framed it in terms of fednow but we have a position in terms of realtime payments and payments more broadly as a pretty unconflicted provider as you said were a very large provider but that unconflicted nature means that whether youre a fintech whether youre a small or mediumsize regional bank whether youre a ph foreign bank were not threatening as a set of rails to plug into and that makes us pretty appealing as a partner but look this is a multiyear endeavor were pleased with the traction weve done a bunch of stuff and were playing it forward but obviously the story is going to be inextricably linked to seeing all of this take hold in the us the other key question that you asked betsy was on digital assets and look i havent changed my point of view here at all i view it as a completely different thing than realtime payments and in fact in digital assets some people do conflate the two and view things like coins and central bank digital currencies as solutions to problems which i would actually argue that realtime payments might be a better solution for so there is a little bit of overlap but i do favor realtime payments more broadly on the question of how to speed up payment rails and payment processes in the united states to make them more efficient but then on digital assets we think this is about the tech weve believed in the fact that distributed ledger technology smart contracts that you can build on top of it have good opportunity over time thats many years maybe several decades evolution its still early hasnt really been proven i think well see opportunities to have more efficiency easier handling of certain asset types think about things that arent as standardized today so theyre messy in the financial services system like real estate and loans probably speed up settlement there on tokenization as a sort of as a new form of handling assets so we like all of those concepts but in terms of the actual cryptos weve said all along were going to be incredibly slow well crawl before we run on digital assets broadly and cryptos are its something that weve gone exceptionally slowly on betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc im sorry you broke up at the end on crypto you mentioned robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp weve gone exceptionally slowly betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2023 yeah and just because of all of the opportunity of all the infrastructure that you have i would think you would be an attractive place for crypto deposits im wondering if thats something that you would agree with or not robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp i dont particularly agree with that no i understand that there are other firms who have over time made it part of their business model to really attract a ton of cash in that space we do not view ourselves as a crypto bank we have a variety of clients we have some clients who touch the digital assets ecosystem but thats not been a business strategy of ours to grow that aggressively betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then just lastly on fednow it launches in the next quarter or so is that accurate and is there a meaningful impact or is this as you mentioned a really long runway to have an impact on your revenues thanks robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp its a longer runway you have to get confirmation from the fed about their exact launch plans because it has evolved a little bit but its a longer runway and it isnt so much fednow as realtime payments of which fednow is one provider betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay super thank you so much appreciate that robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp no problem operator thank you and with that that does conclude our questionandanswer session for today i would now like to hand the call back over to robin with any additional or closing remarks robin vince chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp thank you very much operator and thank you everyone for your interest in bny mellon if you have any follow up questions please reach out to marius and the ir team and we wish you well operator well thank you and this does conclude todays conference and
