item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary the following financial review provides a discussion of synovus financial condition changes in financial condition and results of operations as well as a summary of synovus critical accounting policies this section should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in part ii item financial statements and supplementary data of this report economic environment and recent events the us economy has been substantially impacted by high inflation that began in the middle of as a result the federal reserve aggressively tightened monetary policy with the fomc raising market interest rates bps during and rates have since increased in early primarily due to persistent inflation that remains the largest headwind to the us economy the extent of interest rate increases and the period of time that higher rates will remain in effect depends greatly on the level of inflation and strength of the labor market economic uncertainty and market disruptions outside of inflation remain including geopolitical tensions primarily from russias prolonged war in ukraine the relationship between the us and china and to a lesser extent the lingering impact of the covid19 pandemic on global supply chains tourism business travel immigration and labor participation however these geopolitical uncertainties have served to strengthen the value of the us dollar as global investors flock to higher quality us assets us fiscal policy has been expansionary since due to the covid19 pandemic but government support is declining while leaving a significant federal deficit and a looming congressional debt ceiling debate in the inflation reduction act ira was signed into law in august which raises federal revenue by imposing an alternative corporate minimum tax if certain thresholds are met and a nondeductible excise tax on corporate share repurchases while increasing federal spending to address climate change and reduce prescription drug and healthcare costs for lowerincome households and seniors while the ira does not have a significant immediate impact on synovus it represents a shift from expansionary towards contractionary federal fiscal policy despite certain economic headwinds discussed above with an assetsensitive balance sheet and our position in southeast us markets synovus believes it is wellpositioned to execute on our outlook outlined below by focusing on productivity gains within our core

income per share critical accounting policies the accounting and financial reporting policies of synovus are in accordance with gaap and conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities synovus has identified certain of its accounting policies as critical accounting policies consisting of those related to the accounting for the allowance for credit losses and income taxes in determining which accounting policies are critical in nature synovus has identified the policies that require significant judgment or involve complex estimates it is managements practice to discuss critical accounting policies with the board of directors audit committee on a periodic basis including the development selection implementation and disclosure of the critical accounting policies the application of these policies has a significant impact on synovus consolidated financial statements synovus financial results could differ significantly if different judgments or estimates are applied in the application of these policies allowance for credit losses the acl is a critical accounting estimate that requires significant judgments and assumptions which are inherently subjective the use of different estimates or assumptions could have a significant impact on the provision for credit losses acl financial condition and results of operations the economic and business climate in any given industry or market is difficult to gauge and can change rapidly and the effects of those changes can vary by borrower in accordance with cecl the acl which includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments represents managements best estimate of expected losses over the life of loans adjusted for prepayments and over the life of loan commitments expected to fund synovus loans and unfunded loan commitments are grouped based upon the nature of the loan type and the forecasted pd adjusted for relevant forecasted macroeconomic factors comprising multiple weighted scenarios representing different plausible outcomes and lgd to determine the allowance for the majority of our portfolio expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loan adjusted for expected prepayments and curtailments when appropriate to the extent the lives of the loans in the portfolio extend beyond the period for which a reasonable and supportable forecast can be made which is two years for synovus the company reverts on a straightline basis back to the historical rates over a oneyear period lifeofloan loss percentages may also be adjusted as necessary for certain quantitative and qualitative factors that in managements judgment are necessary to reflect losses expected in the portfolio these adjustments address inherent limitations in the quantitative model loans that do not share risk characteristics are individually evaluated on a loanbyloan basis with specific reserves if any recorded as appropriate given the dynamic relationship between macroeconomic variables within an economic forecast it is difficult to estimate the impact of a change in any one individual variable on the acl as a result when formulating the quantitative estimate management uses a probabilityweighted approach that incorporates a baseline forecast an upside scenario reflecting an accelerated recovery a downside scenario that reflects adverse economic conditions and a scenario that assumes consistent slow growth that is less optimistic than the baseline to illustrate a hypothetical sensitivity analysis management calculated a quantitative allowance using only the downside scenario this downside scenario includes a severe deterioration in economic conditions compared to our baseline forecast the downside forecast assumes a recession starting in the first quarter of as well as worsening inflation pressures which cause the fed to raise interest rates higher than currently expected our quantitative cecl model is most sensitive to the unemployment rate which peaks near in the downside scenario compared to the multiscenario forecasts weighted average peak of around excluding the impact of qualitative considerations using only the downside forecast scenario would result in a hypothetical increase over our reported acl of approximately million at december the sensitivity analysis result does not represent managements view of expected credit losses nor is it intended to estimate future changes in allowance levels for reasons including but not limited to the following management uses a weighted approach applied to multiple economic scenarios for its allowance estimation process the impact of changes in economic variables are interrelated and nonlinear therefore the results of the analysis cannot be extrapolated to additional changes in economic variables subsequent changes in the mix of portfolio characteristics could materially impact results potential future government or regulatory intervention could cause results to differ materially from historical relationships between the economic variables and related credit metrics and the sensitivity analysis does not account for any quantitative or qualitative adjustments incorporated by management as part of its overall allowance framework to reflect losses expected in the portfolio see part ii item financial statements and supplementary data note summary of significant accounting policies and part ii item financial statements and supplementary data note loans and allowance for loan losses in this report for additional details income taxes the calculation of synovus income tax provision is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments in its determination as part of synovus overall business strategy management must consider tax laws and regulations that apply to the specific facts and circumstances under consideration as such the company is often required to exercise significant judgment regarding the interpretation of these tax laws and regulations in which synovus anticipated and actual liability could significantly vary based upon the taxing authoritys interpretation specifically significant estimates in accounting for income taxes relate to the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities estimates of the realizability of deferred tax assets including income tax credits and nols and the need for a valuation allowance the calculation of taxable income the estimation of uncertain tax positions and the determination of temporary differences between book and tax bases adjustments to these items may occur due to modifications in tax rates newly enacted laws issuance of tax regulations resolution of items with taxing authorities alterations to interpretative statutory judicial and regulatory guidance that affects the companys tax positions changes in the companys tax accounting methods or elections or other facts and circumstances management closely monitors tax developments and the potential timing of these changes in order to evaluate the effect they may have on the companys overall tax position and the estimates and judgments used in determining the income tax provision and records adjustments as necessary see part ii item financial statements and supplementary data note summary of significant accounting policies

originated for the purpose of financing owneroccupied properties the financing of owneroccupied facilities is considered a ci loan even though there is improved real estate as collateral this
