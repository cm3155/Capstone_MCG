in financial condition and results of operations as well as a summary of synovus critical accounting policies this section should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in part ii item financial statements and supplementary data of this report economic environment and recent events the us economy contracted in the first half of ending the longest expansionary period in us history due to the covid19 pandemic during march in an effort to lessen the impact of covid19 on consumers and businesses the federal reserve reduced the federal funds rate percentage points to to percent and the us government enacted the cares act the largest economic stimulus package in the nations history synovus responded to the pandemic beginning in march by supporting our clients employees and communities with such measures as remote work capabilities and branch service enhancements loan payment deferrals and accelerated investments in several technology initiatives that provided more convenience and a better digital experience as clients adapted to this highly virtual environment synovus participated in the ppp and funded approximately loans totaling nearly billion under the programs available in both and additional government spending measures and the availability of vaccines improved consumer confidence and demand and the economy largely reopened in leading to a reduction in the unemployment rate and accelerated gdp growth while has seen a recovery in the us economy compared to uncertainty and market disruptions such as additional coronavirus variants pandemicrelated supply chain issues and labor shortages persist the economic expansion has been met with inflationary pressures that are expected to result in fomc policytightening in likely including multiple interest rate hikes with a strong assetsensitive balance sheet and our position in southeast markets that have generally avoided prolonged lockdowns synovus expects increases in loan demand and interest rates will improve returns going forward overview of financial results net income available to common shareholders for was million or

share critical accounting policies the accounting and financial reporting policies of synovus are in accordance with gaap and conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities synovus has identified certain of its accounting policies as critical accounting policies consisting of those related to the accounting for the allowance for credit losses and income taxes in determining which accounting policies are critical in nature synovus has identified the policies that require significant judgment or involve complex estimates it is managements practice to discuss critical accounting policies with the board of directors audit committee on a periodic basis including the development selection implementation and disclosure of the critical accounting policies the application of these policies has a significant impact on synovus consolidated financial statements synovus financial results could differ significantly if different judgments or estimates are applied in the application of these policies allowance for credit losses the acl is a critical accounting estimate that requires significant judgments and assumptions which are inherently subjective the use of different estimates or assumptions could have a significant impact on the provision for credit losses acl financial condition and results of operations the economic and business climate in any given industry or market is difficult to gauge and can change rapidly and the effects of those changes can vary by borrower in accordance with cecl the acl which includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments represents managements best estimate of expected losses over the life of loans adjusted for prepayments and over the life of loan commitments expected to fund synovus loans and unfunded loan commitments are grouped based upon the nature of the loan type and the forecasted pd adjusted for relevant forecasted macroeconomic factors comprising multiple weighted scenarios representing different plausible outcomes and lgd to determine the allowance for the majority of our portfolio expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loan adjusted for expected prepayments and curtailments when appropriate to the extent the lives of the loans in the portfolio extend beyond the period for which a reasonable and supportable forecast can be made which is two years for synovus the company reverts on a straightline basis back to the historical rates over a one year period lifeofloan loss percentages may also be adjusted as necessary for certain quantitative and qualitative factors that in managements judgment are necessary to reflect losses expected in the portfolio these adjustments address inherent limitations in the quantitative model including uncertainty and limitations among others loans that do not share risk characteristics are individually evaluated on a loan by loan basis with specific reserves if any recorded as appropriate given the dynamic relationship between macroeconomic variables within an economic forecast it is difficult to estimate the impact of a change in any one individual variable on the acl as a result when formulating the quantitative estimate management uses a probabilityweighted approach that incorporates a baseline forecast an upside scenario reflecting an accelerated recovery a downside scenario that reflects adverse economic conditions and a scenario that assumes consistent slow growth that is less optimistic than the baseline to illustrate a hypothetical sensitivity analysis management calculated a quantitative allowance using only the downside scenario this downside scenario includes a severe deterioration in economic conditions compared to our baseline forecast the downside forecast assumes an increase in unemployment starting in the first quarter of a decline in consumer confidence and a rise in bankruptcies as forbearance ends consumer spending drops significantly in the first quarter of and the economy falls into recession with the unemployment rate peaking at compared to the baseline forecast that assumes full employment by the end of excluding the impact of qualitative considerations this sensitivity analysis would result in a hypothetical increase over our reported acl of approximately million at december the sensitivity analysis result does not represent managements view of expected credit losses nor is it intended to estimate future changes in allowance levels for reasons including but not limited to the following management uses a weighted approach applied to multiple economic scenarios for its allowance estimation process the impact of changes in economic variables are interrelated and nonlinear therefore the results of the analysis cannot be extrapolated to additional changes in economic variables subsequent changes in the mix of portfolio characteristics could materially impact results potential future government or regulatory intervention could cause results to differ materially from historical relationships between the economic variables and related credit metrics and the sensitivity analysis does not account for any quantitative or qualitative adjustments incorporated by management as part of its overall allowance framework to reflect losses expected in the portfolio see part ii item financial statements and supplementary data note summary of significant accounting policies and part ii item financial statements and supplementary data note loans and allowance for loan losses in this report for additional details income taxes the calculation of synovus income tax provision is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments in its determination as part of synovus overall business strategy management must consider tax laws and regulations that apply to the specific facts and circumstances under consideration as such the company is often required to exercise significant judgment regarding the interpretation of these tax laws and regulations in which synovus anticipated and actual liability could significantly vary based upon the taxing authoritys interpretation specifically significant estimates in accounting for income taxes relate to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets estimates of the realizability of income tax credits utilization of nols the determination of taxable income and the determination of uncertain tax positions and temporary differences between book and tax bases adjustments to these items may occur due to modifications in tax rates newly enacted laws issuance of tax regulations resolution of items with taxing authorities alterations to interpretative statutory judicial and regulatory guidance that affects the companys tax positions methods or election s changes or other facts and circumstances management closely monitors tax developments and the potential timing of these changes in order to evaluate the effect they may have on the companys overall tax position and the estimates and judgments used in determining the income tax provision and records adjustments as necessary see part ii item financial statements and supplementary data note summary of significant accounting policies and part ii item financial statements

contractual payment obligations because of covid19 in the interagency statement on loan modifications and reporting for financial institutions working with customers affected by the coronavirus initially issued on march and revised on april for example the regulatory agencies expressed their view of loan modification programs as positive actions that may mitigate adverse effects on borrowers due to covid19 and their unwillingness to criticize institutions for working with borrowers in a safe and sound manner moreover the interagency statement provided that eligible loan modifications related to covid19 may be accounted for under section of the cares act or in accordance with asc on december the consolidated appropriations act extended the applicable period of section of the cares act this extension allows banks to elect to not consider loan modifications related to covid19 that are made between march and the earlier of january or days after the national emergency ends to borrowers that are current ie less than days past due as of december as tdrs the regulatory agencies further stated that performing loans granted payment deferrals due to covid19 are not considered past due or nonaccrual fasb confirmed the foregoing regulatory agencies view that such shortterm modifications eg six months made on a goodfaith basis in response to covid19 for borrowers who are

the reversal of provision for credit losses of million for the year ended december included net chargeoffs of million and resulted primarily from the continued improvement in the credit outlook for the loan portfolio the reversal of provision for credit losses is due to the reduction in the overall acl as well as a reduction of million in net charge offs compared to the change in reserves is due to the notable improvement in the economic environment compared to december as evidenced by the improvement in the unemployment rate from at the end of to at december likewise our economic and credit

adjusted noninterest expense adjusted total revenue adjusted tangible efficiency ratio adjusted return on average assets adjusted net income per common share diluted adjusted return on average common equity adjusted return on average tangible common equity and the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio are not measures recognized under gaap and therefore are considered nongaap financial measures the most comparable gaap measures to these measures are total noninterest revenue total noninterest expense total te revenue efficiency ratiote return on average assets net income per common share diluted return on average common equity and the ratio of total shareholders equity to total assets respectively management believes that these nongaap financial measures provide meaningful additional information about synovus to assist management and investors in evaluating synovus operating results financial strength the performance of its business and the strength of its capital position however these nongaap financial measures have inherent limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of operating results or capital position as reported under gaap the nongaap financial measures should be considered as additional views of the way our financial measures are affected by significant items and other factors and since they are not required to be uniformly applied they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures at other companies adjusted noninterest revenue and adjusted total revenue are measures used by management to evaluate noninterest revenue and total te revenue exclusive of net investment securities gains losses gain on sale and changes in fair value of private equity investments net and fair value adjustments on nonqualified deferred compensation adjusted noninterest expense and the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio are measures utilized by management to measure the success of expense management initiatives focused on reducing recurring controllable operating costs adjusted return on average assets adjusted net income per common share diluted and adjusted return on average common equity are measurements used by management to evaluate operating results exclusive of items that management believes are not indicative of ongoing operations and impact periodtoperiod comparisons adjusted return on average tangible common equity is a measure used by management to compare synovus performance with other financial institutions because it calculates the
