president chief executive officer synovus financial corp thank you jennifer entering our primary corporate goal was summarized as focused execution that objective was rooted in delivering productivity gains within our core businesses allowing us to deepen relationships grow our client base and enhance financial performance and secondarily continuing to accelerate the contributions generated through our new growth initiatives and adding talent in key businesses and markets to expand our presence and profitability we made steady progress in these areas which led to solid growth and built on our foundation to deliver healthy and consistent earnings and tangible book value growth over time in the midst of executing on our plan we were presented with unforeseen challenges and our synovus team acted quickly and decisively in order to mitigate risk and better position the bank for a more challenging liquidity and economic environment despite a more challenging environment we produced healthy and consistent loan growth in key commercial business lines including middle market corporate and investment banking and specialty lending corporate and investment banking which was officially launched in mid2022 continues to prudently grow and execute with over million in loans outstanding and became ppnr positive in the middle of last year also our team was laserfocused on accelerating our core funding generation through sales activities product expansion and specialty businesses as a result we delivered an increase in total deposit production in synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 we delivered strong doubledigit growth and adjusted fee income in as our treasury and payment solutions capital markets and wealth management teams continue to expand their contributions supported by new solutions analytics and an intense focus on building full relationships also we further augmented and diversified our noninterest revenue stream with an expanded balance sheet light relationship with greensky we maintain top quartile efficiency through proactive expense rationalization and disciplined cost management while continuing to make the investments in areas that will drive longterm shareholder value on the asset quality front we continue to experience very manageable levels of credit losses and see no systemic deterioration across our asset classes and footprint finally the balance sheet was strengthened in from solid core deposit growth and a reduction of office commercial real estate loans and higher cost wholesale funding we also increased our common equity tier ratio to over through solid earnings accretion and prudent balance sheet optimization moreover the business mix was streamlined with the sale of our asset management firm globalt which enables us to reallocate investment into higher returning business lines now lets move to slides and for an overview of the fourth quarter and full year financial highlights synovus reported fourth quarter diluted earnings per share of and adjusted earnings per share of for we reported in diluted earnings per share and in adjusted eps however the million fdic special assessment reduced fourth quarter reported and adjusted earnings per share by therefore excluding the fdic assessment fourth quarter reported eps would have been and adjusted eps would have been higher funding costs and loan losses were headwinds for the banking industry in but in this challenging environment synovus was able to grow core deposits core noninterest revenue and maintain disciplined expense control even with the challenges and excluding the fdic special assessment adjusted preprovision net revenue increased about last year net interest income grew million for the year or roughly despite an basis point margin contraction excluding strategic loan sales of billion in period end loans increased about led by ci business lines including middle market cib and specialty lending despite muted activity cre also experienced year overyear growth driven by increased utilization on previously committed construction facilities there continues to be an increased emphasis on stronger returns and more deposit relationshipbased lending and we are pleased with the increased margin and relationship profitability profile of the originations on the funding side total core deposits increased and total borrowings declined in our fourth quarter net interest margin of was stable quarteroverquarter and better than our prior guidance as a result of modestly lower than expected core interestbearing deposit costs also we were able to reduce higher cost funding in broker deposits and fhob borrowings due to the continued success of our deposit production activities we remain confident that our net interest margin has reached a positive inflection point and should be relatively stable in the first quarter a more stable monetary policy environment coupled with fixed rate asset repricing should support the nim as we progress throughout and provide a multiyear tailwind for net interest income despite continued headwinds from a soft mortgage environment and intentional reductions in checking program fees adjusted noninterest revenue increased in supported by increases in treasury and payment solution fees capital market fees and wealth management fees as well as higher greensky income synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 noninterest expense remains well contained our proactive cost rationalization and management initiatives have placed synovus in a strong position as we start in this uncertain environment asset quality remains healthy excluding our loan sales net chargeoffs were a manageable basis points in the fourth quarter and basis points for the full year nonperforming assets increased at a slower pace over the last three months and we further built the allowance for credit losses finally we continue to focus on maintaining a strong capital position as we navigate through a more uncertain economic environment and with our cet1 position ending the quarter at up from the a year ago we remain confident in our capital profile and well within our targeted capital levels of to we continue to make consistent progress in diversifying and optimizing our business mix with growth in several key areas including middle market commercial banking cib treasury and payment solutions capital markets banking as a service and wealth management these are the core businesses where we have shown the right to win and through execution and expansion well deliver solid revenue growth well into the future our talent is what truly differentiates synovus our key objectives for the team in are one prudently growing the bank two winning full relationships and three enhancing profits we are committed to delivering on these objectives while preserving and even improving key elements of our safety and soundness profile i have great confidence in our ability to not only meet our goals but also to outpace our competition now ill turn it over to jamie to cover the quarterly results in greater detail andrew jamie gregory jr executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thank you kevin as you can see on slide total loan balances ended the fourth quarter down million sequentially or about while loans declined modestly overall trends were positive as key strategic business lines saw growth and transactionrelated declines signaled a return to more normal commercial real estate market activity there were three primary drivers of the modest sequential decline in loans first loan production has been softer over the past few quarters also cre and senior housing market transaction activity increased significant over the last three months due to property sales and refinancing which we believe shows more strength in those markets finally strategic declines in nonrelationship syndicated lending and thirdparty consumer loans continued in the fourth quarter further positioning our balance sheet for core client growth while ci loans declined million sequentially during the fourth quarter there was strategic growth in middle market loans cib and specialty lines these commercial loan categories also saw growth for the full year with regards to commercial real estate excluding the billion medical office building sale last quarter we generated approximately loan growth last year primarily from fundups of existing commitments we continue to prioritize clients both new and existing with broadbased deposit and fee income relationships at the same time we are rationalizing growth and creditonly lending areas such as shared national credits and thirdparty consumer lending that have a lower return profile or dont meet our strategic relationship objectives as a result of higher loan paydown activity and muted production we expect to see a reduction in senior housing and institutional commercial real estate this year our organic balance sheet optimization efforts will continue in as we focus on balanced loan and core deposit growth synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 turning to slide core deposit balances grew million or sequentially during the fourth quarter driven by a increase in time deposits and a increase in interestbearing demand deposits which was partially offset by a decline in noninterestbearing deposits seasonality contributed to public funds growth of million or on a sequential basis and the pace of noninterestbearing declines remains below the level experienced during the peak in early our strong fourth quarter core deposit growth allowed us to reduce broker deposits by million and overall borrowings by about million resulting in continued improvement in our wholesale funding ratio to from in the third quarter as we look at funding costs our average cost of deposits increased basis points in the fourth quarter to as a result our cycle today total deposit beta was which was just below the range we communicated at an industry conference last month from october to december total deposit costs were up basis points we continue to expect the deposit costs will peak sometime during the first quarter now moving to slide net interest income was million in the fourth quarter a decline of from the third quarter which is slightly better than our previously disclosed expectations our net interest margin was stable during the fourth quarter versus 9basispoint sequential decline in the third quarter betterthanexpected core interestbearing deposit costs reduced borrowings and the increasing earning asset yields supported the margin the partial securities repositioning which was completed in december had an estimated to 2basispoint impact in the fourth quarter with an incremental to basis points benefit expected in the first quarter as we look forward assuming a stable rate environment we continue to expect the first quarter net interest margin to be relatively stable followed by expansion in the second half of the year longer term the benefits of fixed asset repricing remain a significant tailwind to the margin our sensitivity profile remains relatively neutral to the front end of the curve and we remain slightly assetsensitive to longerterm rates however during an easing cycle the margin will exhibit shortterm pressure due to the timing lag between loan and deposit repricing slide shows total reported noninterest revenue of million adjusted noninterest revenue was million up million or from the previous quarter the sequential variance in fee income was due to a onetime greensky fee of million related to its legacy loan portfolio as well as stronger treasury and payment solutions and nonglobaltrelated wealth fees with the expansion of our relationship with greensky we anticipate onetimerelated fees of about million in the first quarter and approximately million in ongoing quarterly noninterest revenue thereafter which is currently reflected in our fundamental guidance there were million in security losses during the fourth quarter which we had previously announced in december also the globalt sale at the end of the third quarter reduced noninterest revenue by approximately million we continued to invest in core noninterest revenue streams that deepen our client relationships and have all demonstrated healthy growth this year treasury and payment solutions fees were up while wealth management fees increased and capital markets fees grew in fact syndicated finance and debt capital markets fees jumped over in noninterest revenue has also been impacted by a soft mortgage lending market as well as recent changes to our checking program however the banks relative stability of core client fee income over time highlights the diversity of our revenue streams many of which are insulated from the impacts of the volatile rate environment synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 moving to expense slide highlights our ongoing operating cost discipline reported and adjusted noninterest expense was million in the fourth quarter the million fdic special assessment inflated fourth quarter reported and adjusted noninterest expense without that expense adjusted noninterest expense would have declined from the third quarter in september we took prudent expense rationalization actions that will still allow synovus to appropriately invest for infrastructure needs and future growth adjusted employment expense was down sequentially and yearoveryear benefited by head count reductions during the fourth quarter as well as lower performance incentives finally the recent globalt sale reduced expense by about million in the fourth quarter as you can see on slide total head count is down from over that same period revenue has increased resulting in an increase in revenue per fte of and a top quartile efficiency ratio our sharp focus on operating expense discipline and prudent discretionary spend will continue throughout as we manage through headwinds that pressure industry earnings moving to slides and on credit quality credit metrics were relatively stable from the previous quarter adjusted for the third quarter loan sales with a net chargeoff ratio of an npl ratio of and a total criticized and classified loan ratio of the allowance for credit losses increased by million to million or of total loans up basis points from the third quarter we continue to expect ncos to average loans to be to basis points in the first half of and we have a high degree of confidence in the strength and quality of our loan portfolio moreover we will continue to apply conservative underwriting practices and advanced market analytics to new loan originations and portfolio monitoring and management as seen on slide our capital position improved during the fourth quarter with the common equity tier ratio reaching and total riskbased capital now at capital accretion was impacted by the fdic special assessment and the securities losses during the fourth quarter but as was the case throughout our core earnings profile continues to support our capital position looking ahead our capital plan includes a stable common dividend and prioritizing prudent capital management within our targeted range of to similar to and we have authorization for up to million in share repurchases in ill now turn it back to kevin to discuss our guidance kevin s blair chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp thank you jamie ill now continue with our updated financial guidance for which is unchanged from the expectations we outlined in early december loan growth is expected to be between and in growth should be driven by continued success in middle market corporate and investment banking and specialty lending business lines this growth should be partially offset by marketrelated loan paydowns which are expected to return to more normalized levels and rationalization of creditonly loan relationships we maintain our expectations for core deposit growth of to despite a challenging and uncertain industrywide growth environment we have confidence that our focus on core deposit production and expansion of relationships will continue to bear fruit in the adjusted revenue growth outlook continues to be in a range of negative to which assumes a flat interest rate environment the recent volatility in interest rates has shown the uncertainty in the outlooks for rates synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 the reduction in loan rates to the area if maintained would impact our revenue outlook for negatively by approximately however considering this impact our outlook remains within the current revenue guidance it is uncertain how will play out with regards to fed interest rate policy but we expect two things to be true first its a shortterm negative for net interest income and margin during the easing cycle as deposits reprice slower than loans and second over the longer term we are relatively neutral to the shortterm interest rates so the margin is expected to revert back to the starting point and likely higher once the easing cycle is completed adjusted noninterest expense which includes the fourth quarter fdic special assessment is expected to decline between and in from a combination of several initiatives including personnel and business optimization back office and corporate real estate rationalization and less discretionary and thirdparty spend we will continue to be very disciplined in expense management while investing in areas that deliver longterm shareholder value the result of expanding nim and controlled expenses has forecasted acceleration of core ppnr growth throughout the year assuming a stable economic environment we expect to end with strong growth in financial performance and an eye towards our longer term operating metric targets moving to capital we are within our cet1 range of to and well opportunistically manage our capital levels within this target range dependent on forecasted economic conditions we anticipate that tax rates should approximate to primarily supported by additional tax credit investments and further diversification of our revenue sources synovus strategic actions in as well as the strength of the business model and the relative growth of our footprint have positioned the company for strong longterm revenue earnings and tangible book value growth and now operator lets open the call for qa synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions and in the interest of time please limit yourself to one question and one followup our first question today comes from jon arfstrom from rbc capital markets your line is now open jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good morning everyone kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning jon andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc just wanted to go kevin you touched on it and jamie as well but on the revenue growth guide and your interest rate assumptions when i look at that guidance range what takes you to the lower end of that range and the higher end of that range is this mostly interest rate driven and what is kind of built into that guidance in terms of the shortterm rate variance andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah jon this is jamie thanks for the question as we think about volatility in revenue in the risks and opportunities are actually fairly similar to each other it comes from things like deposit mix economic activity and the fed interest rate policy so you know that our guidance is basically a flat rate scenario so we have no fed easing in the guidance we have the longend stand stable at but within that using those assumptions we would say that the biggest risks and opportunities come from deposit mix economic growth loan growth business growth we would say those can present both risks and opportunities to jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay and at this point if you think about the forward curve in terms of your net interest income outlook how much of a headwind is that jamie how difficult is that environment andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah we debated a good bit how to best give insight into our performance in given the volatility of interest rates we decided to keep the frontend stable but then speak to the impact based on the easing cycle just so people could use whatever rate scenario they deem most appropriate because the assumptions change weekly if synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 you compare where we were even a couple of weeks ago the assumptions for fed easing are very different than where they are today but for us as kevin mentioned in his guidance comments just a minute ago longer term we are neutral to the frontend of the curve and what we mean by that is that when we come out of the easing cycle and deposits normalized to the lower levels we expect our margin to be relatively similar to where it was when we entered the cycle but during the cycle the lag on deposit costs relative to loan yield declines will reduce the margin and thats dependent on a few things the impact of is dependent on the timing of easing when does the fed begin the easing cycle the speed of the easing and how far does it go but when we think about the impact to our margin we think that that impact during the easing cycle could be anywhere between and reduction in the margin and then again we would revert back to the starting point once those deposit costs stabilize at the end of the easing cycle so the timing is very important the speed is important the depth is important but those thats generally how we see that impact with regards to a full year revenue guide it could be anywhere up to of full year revenue given the scenarios weve seen from economists markets fed dot plot etcetera but there are other things that are not included in that guide one is in an easing cycle its likely that that will be a positive impact to deposit mix shifts and thats not included in my comments here and our expectations it also doesnt take into account the associated positives to economic growth fee revenue as well as credit jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay good thats all very helpful thank you very much all of you kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp thanks jon operator our next question today comes from michael rose from raymond james your line is now open michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning guys thanks for taking my questions kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc wanted to go to good morning wanted to go to slide and maybe if you can just kevin expand on the tailwinds and headwinds that are on the chart and then how we should frame up expectations for the greensky expanded partnership as we move forward as it relates to the outlook for the year thanks synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp yeah michael when we look at the slide i think it speaks to the diversity of our revenue and how weve continued to try to add new sources of growth that allows us to take on some of the headwinds and so whether its the sale of a business or just reducing our nsfod income or seeing a movement on products like repo where weve been very successful this last year if you look at the lefthand side of that chart banking as a service is greensky which were continuing to work through the contractual finalizing the contract there and we still expect that to represent a sizable increase in income in but also within banking as a service were expanding our offerings within our merchant acquiring company where we own a majority interest qualpay weve expanded our sponsorship of thirdparty isos and so all of those bankingasaservice programs will contribute growth yearoveryear treasury and payment solutions if you look at the last three years weve grown it we expect that to continue to increase in with some repricing opportunities as well as continued expansion of our sales practices wealth was up this past year with aum growing we expect that to continue to grow based on the talent and the success of our business model capital markets as weve expanded cib and our wholesale bank weve continued to grow thats up in and that will continue to grow in and then weve seen some traction on some of the government guarantee gains whether thats usda or sba loans and so when you look at all of those that will help to offset those headwinds and we think well get a little bit of growth in nir this coming year as a result of that michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc thats great color and maybe just as my followup i appreciate all the color related to jons questions but just wanted to dig into some of the mix shift the comments that you mentioned jamie and then how quickly do you guys think you would be able to kind of pull down some of the interestbearing deposit costs assuming we do get a couple rate cuts this year i think thats a pretty big outstanding question for you and a lot of banks thanks andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah its one of the bigger questions for the industry for for sure when you well first in our assumptions we assume that nib declines further in to somewhere between and of total deposits but to your question on interestbearing costs we really break it up into four buckets and so or three buckets excluding nib we have what we call the kind of high beta systematic repricing which would include broker deposits in our core cd portfolio those reductions the broker deposits are near ph beta and time deposits reprice pretty systematically given maturities schedules so thats pretty simple but then you have the interestbearing nonmaturity deposits and what we have is for us about of total deposits are standard rates and those reprice through decisions we make centrally and the rates on those deposits are lower within our interestbearing deposits and so the beta will be a little lower but the repricing is simpler than the exception price deposits exception around in total those are higher costs and so we do expect the beta to be lower but they involve a conversation and so were already focused on strategies of how synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 do we address that subcomponent of the deposit portfolio but were ready to go and were prepared for these in cycle michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc appreciate all the color guys thanks for taking my questions operator our next question comes from steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan your line is now open please go ahead steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc sorry to ask your third nim question in a row but i think clarity would be important here and i know jamie those scenarios that are changing every day but if you just look at the current forward curve say six cuts you guys are guiding under flat rates to get to a nim in how does that change if the forward curve plays out andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp i think you need to look to the prior comment around to compression of the margin during the cycle depending on how fast its going but if you assume a steady cuts per meeting i would just assume that the margin contracts somewhere between and in the fourth quarter steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc to down got it and your commentary is interesting about eventually returning to where the nim used to be and your nim used to be to do you think with that normally slope yield curve i know its been years since weve had one in normal rates you could get back into that range andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp so when we look further out when we we didnt include it in this deck but weve included it in our two prior investor decks the fixed rate asset repricing the benefit due to fixed rate asset repricing in is approximately synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 basis points and you could run that forward for it doesnt go forever but it does go for the next few years and so we think that that is a really strong tailwind now there are headwinds that are not included in that and one would be deposit mix and other would be business mix as far as loan spreads and where youre originating loans but that tailwind is there and so we do believe that when we get through whatever this easing cycle is however it plays out so we continue to have a strong tailwind to the margin for multiple years and we expect to see that play out and that would get us in the context of what youre describing with higher whats kind of historically more normalized margins steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay thanks if i could ask one other question so you guys had core revenue growth in really strong fee income growth and if i look at the guide youre down to plus when i think about the company or markets your position i think back to the investor day all the initiatives when i look at this really for you kevin are you pleased with that level of growth and is it that i perceive you to be more of a strong organic growth company but youre more about improving efficiency if you will just curious your take on the revenue capabilities of the company here this year thanks kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp yeah i think the percent growth in revenue is much more of a function of the decline in the nim from first quarter to fourth quarter and so when you look at a full yearoveryear increase in revenue it shows that negative number but when you look at it more on an inflection point you go back to fourth quarter earnings from versus fourth quarter of what youll see is that there is an to growth in ppnr and i think thats what does get me excited and it really does show the strength of our model steve and our footprint and our ability to grow but what youre seeing when you look at yearoveryear is much more of the financial metrics declining and margin during which makes that yearoveryear comparison look muted but when you look at it on a more applestoapples basis fourth quarter versus fourth quarter youre looking at growth in bottom line which i think again is much more constructive and supporting of our growth story steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay thanks for taking my questions operator our next question today comes from brady gailey from kbw please go ahead brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you good morning guys andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning brady synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc my first question is on greensky i understand the somewhat onetime in nature income that happened in the and that will happen in but as you look longer term what is the earnings impact that greensky could add to synovus and i think all that is realized in fee income correct andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp it is brady and look i said this on a previous call the number could be between million and million in revenue for the goforward program and its really a function more so of what the underlying production is of the new entity and so well continue to generate revenue based on that production and well get a maintenance administration fee on anything that still sits on the book so our revenue will be much more tied to the production volumes that theyre doing but again i think a good rule of thumb for this coming year is million to million brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay all right thats helpful and then kevin as you look bigger picture theres been so much change at synovus over recent years i know just in you exited medical office and auto you did the bond restructuring are you happy with where the business sits right now or are there other big strategic moves that we should be expecting going forward kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp look im happy with where our business mix sits today i think there are opportunities to continue to overinvest in certain businesses whether thats our middle market platform our private wealth platform our banking as a service and so youll see us continue to make strategic investments in those areas but as it relates to things like loan sales or exiting businesses i think those you will not see a lot of that going forward and when you look at our loan slide we provided this quarter and you look at where we grew some of those strategic growth engines like middle market specialty community bank are growing where you see strategic declines in things like our thirdparty consumer which will continue to decline for the foreseeable future as well as national accounts those wont be sales but therell be slow drawdowns of those balances because theyre not obviously relationshipfocused but the wild card on growth really comes in those market activity declines that we saw this past quarter where you see institutional cre where payoffs are increasing because theyve been at historically low levels our senior housing same thing were seeing a more constructive marketplace for sales and refinance activity with some of the agencies and so as i look at the business and just put loans on that as an example i feel really good about where we are well be growing some faster than others well be strategically shrinking some portfolios but you wont see the dramatic balance sheet or business mix optimization like weve seen in brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay got it thanks kevin operator our next question comes from brandon king from truist securities please go ahead synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey good morning kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning brandon brandon king q analyst truist securities inc so previously cd repricing was thought to be a headwind to nii and the margin i guess thats still the case for shortterm but could you give us an update on your cd strategy going forward as we potentially enter an easing cycle kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp well look yeah brandon on cd strategy we still have a lot of renewing cds that will come forward in the coming quarters and so were going to continue to be very aggressive at pricing those cds at market rates to keep them on the books obviously the marginal rate of a new cd when you look at this past quarter was when you combine production and renewals which was actually down about basis points versus the previous quarter and so it shows you that theres been a little bit of a rationalization in the marketplace from a competitive perspective but our portfolio is at about today so as we continue to produce new cds which again appears to be the decision of the consumer people are still moving money from money market accounts into time deposit and so we want to make sure that we pay attention to the consumer preference so well continue to produce that but at some point that portfolio will largely equal where the production is so to be less of a headwind as it relates to deposit pricing and as jamie has mentioned in the past the real benefit that well have to reach maximum deposit pricing will be deposit mix so as we continue to bring down broker and we can replace that with core deposits the negative impact that headwind you faced with cd production will be offset by a positive shift in mix and so thats why we think in the first quarter well largely see the peak for deposit pricing andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp and brandon just to add a little more to that answer the first quarter the core cds that are maturing the average rate is just over thats about and so the marginal impact of that to the margin is much less than it was in the fourth quarter as kevin mentioned and then as we look forward in our core deposit growth will be led by money market in which will be a little bit of a change from and so we believe that that will also be a positive when you think about total deposit costs going forward brandon king q analyst truist securities inc very helpful very helpful and then jamie just give us an update on how you think about managing the balance sheet this year in regards to your liquidity position and maybe the potential to pay down more debt synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp as we look at the balance sheet our liquidity position is very strong the efforts we made in have positioned us really well for so we can go out there and do what we do best which is serve our clients and so thats how we feel heading into this year what you should expect to see from us is a continued paydown or attrition of our broker deposit portfolio potentially million to million here in the first quarter we are very low on home loan bank advances at the moment a little less than billion at yearend so as we look forward we think that we are positioned to optimize liabilities out of balance sheet we dont have any imminent needs for unsecured debt and we think that well continue to try to be balanced on core deposit growth which will be more backend loaded this year and core loan growth which could be more balanced growth throughout the year so we may have a little bit of a funding gap between loans and deposits early in the year but thats not unexpected brandon king q analyst truist securities inc thanks for taking my questions kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp thank you brandon operator our next question comes from timur braziler from wells fargo please go ahead timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning timur timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc maybe asking brandons question a little differently so wholesale funding went from to you continue to work that down i guess ultimately as you continue working on the liability side of the balance sheet where is the target there where could that wholesale funding ratio continue to migrate towards andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp were very comfortable with where it is right now were comfortable with our liquidity all together and so its really just a balancing thats not a ratio that we manage to and so we look at all of our hierarchal sources of funding including the marginal public funds and we think about how do we optimize our liability mix to fund the balance sheet synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 but we have a lot of sources of liquidity we have a lot of sources of liquidity that are higher cost and right now given our liquidity position we have the luxury of being able to run those down but as we look forward into and beyond its our intent to go out and take advantage of the opportunity in the southeast and as kevin mentioned in response to stevens question go out and grow and deliver synovus to more and more clients and so we believe that we are wellpositioned for that and whether or not we fund that with priority one being core deposit growth but beyond that we have a lot of availability either in wholesale funding which would include broker deposits or home loan bank advances or even go out and grow some of those easier marginal sources of liquidity like public funds timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay got it and then switching to the loan side so you had the medical office sale earlier in the year youre working down balances in senior housing i guess one whats your remaining exposure or what is your exposure to kind of the healthcare medical field and then two as you look at it from a credit standpoint where are you guys at as far as credit quality and things to look for primarily within that senior housing portfolio kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp well look from a healthcare perspective you have to look at it really across two different areas on ci its about of our balances and a lot of that is on the senior housing side we talked about managing down our exposure there it was really more around the fact that weve seen more payoff activities and so we feel really good about where we are in senior housing when you look at some of the losses that we incurred this quarter there were a handful of losses and bob can touch on that but we feel very good about the overall exposure and so we are not trying to manage down our exposure in healthcare some of it has been just the fact that weve started to see a more constructive market in terms of payoff activity and put that in broader perspective when we talk about that we had about billion in payoffs this past quarter weve been running about million to million a quarter in our loan book so about million more in payoffs if you look at a three year average we generally run about billion in payoff activity so were back to a more normalized level so you could continue to see things like senior housing and some other cre portfolios decline just given the fact that production has slowed and payoff activities picked up bob if you want to touch on some of the credit metrics around that robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp sure yeah specifically to the senior housing metrics of our portfolio in that space is still passrated credit so we have a fairly low ratio of rated loans there our chargeoffs have been small and manageable and non accrual loans are also small and specifically the shrinkage there to kevins point of really the market the payoffs beginning to pick up and the net effect of that would just be a reduction in that specific portfolio overall though were pretty comfortable with healthcare as an industry we have our specialty vertical in our corporate and investment banking business that specializes in healthcare its just that the senior housing portfolio itself so a lot of real estate characteristics is probably seeing some reduction relative to the increase in payoffs but the credit quality certainly still remains manageable synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you for the color operator our next question comes from christopher marinac from janney montgomery scott please go ahead christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc thanks good morning i wanted to dive into the deposit growth and the success youre having there kevin or jamie can you give us additional background in terms of where that growth is focused are you looking at the sort of standard customer using jamies explanation a few callers ago or even would you take on new exception customer if it sort of fit your objectives kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp you go ahead jamie you go ahead andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp as we think about deposit growth its a very important component to our outlook for but before speaking to this year id like to speak to because we had core deposit growth in with significant headwinds in the first half of the year including the billion decline in nonbearing deposits and i think that that shows the strength of our production i mean production was up yearoveryear and that strong production is basically result of renewed focus driving deposit growth incentive realignment and we think that thatll continue and we think that thats what is the underpinnings of our core deposit growth forecast for and so we have our incentives are pushing it were having the intentional buildout of our businesses aligned around bringing in the full client which will include increased deposit growth we have a new leader in private wealth focused on full relationships cib is growing and theyve hired a liquidity specialist whose partnering with new and existing clients to help bring liquidity solutions to our commercial clients and our commercial lines of business continue to target clients with full balanced relationships and one data point on that is in our middle market business we had core deposit growth in and so we believe that fundamentally were well positioned to grow deposits this year and we think that that should see continued success christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great do you think that lower rates could actually trigger more cirelated movements in your business kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp well number one it could trigger line utilization increasing just as rates come down we did see a modest increase in just same line balances this past quarter but as you know chris for the last several quarters weve synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 seen folks using their cash to pay down lines so i think lower rates will drive up some line utilization one short term if rates were going lower it tells us that the economy is slowing so there may be a latent impact of that but longer term or more moderate term yes i think it could drive up ci as people are looking at projects again and starting to expand their facilities or add inventory as prices come down and the economic the underlying economic conditions remain constructive yes it would result in having stronger loan growth in that kind of the outquarters christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great thank you both for the background we appreciate it kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp thank you chris operator we will now take a question from russell gunther from stephens your line is now open please go ahead russell e t gunther q analyst stephens inc hey good morning guys i just have a couple of points of clarification on the margin commentary so first the outlook of around thats down from the expectation earlier in the month despite the better results in so could you just walk us through whats changed andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp that is simply the reduction in the long end of the curve so thats the move from 10year to a 10year that drove the decline from to russell e t gunther q analyst stephens inc okay excellent and then just to follow up again then on the to decline using the forward curve so are you guys talking relative to the margin on a percentage basis or is that nii dollars and then are you guys thinking of the starting point as results or relative to your expectation andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp ph and ill point on the to and thats a to reduction in the margin so to basis points is if you assume if you want to assume that the fed begins easing in may you could assume that the  whatever you had in there for your  margin would be to lower and so thats kind of how were thinking about it just because the assumptions continue to change around when does this easing cycle start and how aggressive is it we just wanted to give you something so that you could plug in whatever your expectation is and then just know that once were in that cycle that is what we expect the impact to the margin to be russell e t gunther q analyst stephens inc synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 all right thats very helpful i appreciate the clarification thank you guys andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah operator our final question comes from brody preston from ubs please go ahead brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc good morning everyone andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc jamie could i just wanted again just to clarify that was a to basis points so that per cut that youre kind of saying on a static balance sheet andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp no no thats not per cut thats just during the cycle thats our expectation of where the margin will be as we progress through the cycle brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay okay so it would be if the forward curve comes to pass its the to basis points off of the that youre kind of outlining as the ending point for the nim by the fourth quarter andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah and within that range you could say that the more aggressive the fed is so if theyre going faster then its going to be at the higher end of the range the larger negative impact and if its a slow methodical it could be the lower end of the range brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay and within the guidance kind of setting the forward curve aside what are you including for a broker deposit runoff andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 we are assuming i mentioned the million to million this quarter and then you would assume probably not the highend of that range each quarter going forward but maybe million to million  to  decline in broker deposits brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay cool and then i just want to ask one last one on the other income i know that greensky the million was in there but setting the greensky aside it looks like it was still a decent quarter for the other income line item and so i just wanted to ask what drove that and is it sustainable and for the guidance for lowsingle digit growth in fee income could you just remind us what base that is growing off of andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp in other income theres a little bit of that that is not necessarily repeatable we had about a million increase in boli revenue in the fourth quarter versus prior quarters and so thats something as we think about fee revenue in the first quarter there are two headwinds you have that million then you have the impact of the greensky fourth quarter transaction that will not reoccur in the first quarter what was the second part of your question brody brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc just the lowsingle digit growth in fee income that i think you called out on the slide just remind me what the base that youre growing that off of is andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp we had adjusted fee revenue for this year what was that its right at kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp it is thats right andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus
