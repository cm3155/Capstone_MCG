thank you cal and officially welcome jennifer we couldnt be in better hands with the two of you in your new roles for our company what youll see today is financial performance that remains quite strong with ppnr of yearoveryear and an adjusted return on tangible common equity of despite a slowing economic environment and tighter liquidity market which led to another quarter of contraction in our net interest margin we continue to see evidence that our relationshipbased model serves as a strong platform to attract and retain talent as well as clients our team member turnover is the lowest its been in many years engagement levels are high and we continue to add talent in key revenue producing and corporate services areas from a client perspective deposit production remained strong with second quarter levels over higher compared to the same period last year while loan production remains muted versus last year commitment levels increased versus last quarter and second quarter adjusted fee income is up versus the previous year and while youll see shifts in some of our expectations for the year to adjust to the trends were seeing internally and externally we also still strongly believe our success todate as well as our path forward is the result of our intentional approach to expand our business diversify our client base and gain share of wallet all while increasing our investments in innovative solutions to further enhance the client experience and sources of revenue we have also quickly responded to the changing economic environment and the recent industry headwinds to better manage the emerging risk over the course of the year we have increased our cet1 ratio by approximately basis points reduced the percentage of deposits that are uninsured increased contingent funding sources to billion and reduced the midpoint of our expense guidance for the year by percentage points excluding the impact of the qualpay transaction our bank has made significant strides in recent years paving a path forward towards achieving our longterm financial goals while pursuing growth opportunities and maximizing profitability in this environment we remain committed to optimizing our overall risk profile by implementing robust risk management practices closely monitoring market trends and adapting to regulatory changes we aim to ensure the stability and resilience of our synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 operations our dedicated team strive to strike a balance between growth and risk management fostering a culture of prudence and innovation that sets us on a trajectory of sustainable success now lets move to slide for the quarterly financial highlights when looking at the same period in the previous year revenue and ppnr grew at high singledigit rate supported by strong operating metrics which linked quarter saw revenue and ppnr headwinds as a result of increased deposit cost and nib remixing leading to margin contraction loans increased million or quarteroverquarter as we saw in the first quarter this growth rate declined from prior year levels as we continue to experience lower loan production due to client demand and our increased emphasis on returns and relationshipbased lending after seasonal taxrelated outflows in april core deposits increased modestly and ended the quarter roughly flat with the first quarter much like the rest of the industry we continue to see pressures from noninterestbearing deposit remixing as clients have increased their use of their operating funds thereby further reducing average balance per account our underlying credit performance remained solid and although our credit metrics are experiencing some expected increases as a result of the current environment overall credit trends are healthy and we have not seen meaningful change in the underlying performance of our borrowing base or stress focused in any particular industry or asset class lastly as ive stated previously we continue to focus on maintaining a strong capital position as we navigate through the uncertain environment and with the cet1 position ending the quarter at we are well inside of achieving our objective of exceeding cet1 by the end of the year now ill turn it over to jamie to cover the second quarter results in greater detail jamie andrew jamie gregory jr executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thank you kevin id like to begin with loan growth as seen on slide total loan balances ended the second quarter at billion reflecting growth of million as kevin mentioned new production and overall growth have slowed as new fundings are focused on customers with more broadbased relationships similar to previous quarters cre growth was a function of draws related to existing multifamily commitments and a low level of payoffs on the ci side the slight decline in balances was driven by lower utilization and exit of certain syndicated loanonly relationships lower ci utilization is a positive credit signal reflective of the health of our overall borrowing base in the current environment we are rationalizing growth in areas that have a lower return profile or dont meet our strategic relationship objectives on that note in july we signed an agreement to sell a billion medical office cre portfolio this transaction is expected to result in a onetime negative net income impact of approximately million in the third quarter and reflects the exit of a business that maintained pristine credit quality despite not meeting our longterm strategic criteria turning to slide deposit balances remained relatively flat for the quarter core deposits saw a modest increase after april seasonal declines and despite a more tempered outlook we continue to expect deposit growth through the remainder of the year supporting this growth are seasonal tailwinds along with targeted deposit efforts including deposit specialist hires and focused industry vertical initiatives synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 looking at the composition of the quarterly change in balances noninterestbearing deposits were down billion quarteroverquarter a byproduct of the aforementioned seasonality from tax payments cash deployment of excess funds and continued pressures from the higher rate environment as in the first quarter the decline in mma was largely impacted by a shift to other products in particular the cds within our consumer customer base as we look at deposit rates our average cost of deposits increased basis points in the second quarter to which equates to a cycletodate total deposit beta of through  our deposit costs and betas were impacted by the anticipated pricing lags on core interestbearing deposits as well as the decline in noninterest bearing deposits we expect those same dynamics to play out in  with deposit pricing lags continuing albeit at a slower pace given the fomcs slower pace of tightening and with some further decline in noninterestbearing deposits as a percent of total deposits the result is further pressure on our expectations for throughthecycle total deposit betas which we now approximate will end the year in the context of to last quarter we included statistics on our liquidity position that detailed our level of insured deposits and contingent liquidity sources these figures have been updated and are available in the appendix to this presentation now to slide net interest income was million in the second quarter an increase of versus the light quarter one year ago and a decline of from the first quarter in line with our previously disclosed expectations the asset side of our balance sheet continued to benefit from both higher balances and rates though as in the first quarter higher deposit pricing and remixing within our nib deposit portfolio offset those gains resulting in overall nim compression as we look forward we expect  nim to continue to contract at a pace similar to that in  followed by some relative stabilization thereafter as deposit pricing lags and nib remixing slowed against those diminishing headwinds should be the gradual benefit which accrues to the margin from fixed rate repricing which has a compounding effect and should support the margin through time assuming this higher rate environment remains slide shows total adjusted noninterest revenue of million down million from the previous quarter and up million yearoveryear the primary variance in quarteronquarter fee income was due to the extremely strong first quarter for capital markets which normalized as expected that said despite lower overall industrywide transaction volume the current level of capital markets income reflects the benefit of strategic investments in our cib and middle market banking platforms as we step back and look at the overall levels of durable core client fee income excluding mortgage the investments across our franchise and products and services continue to bear fruit over the last four years we have compounded core client fee income at nearly a doubledigit pace as we continue to invest in valuable revenue streams such as treasury and payments solutions capital markets and wealth management also of note in the second quarter is the closing of our qualpay investment which we announced last year the goforward impact is expected to have an immaterial impact to consolidated net income and is reflected in our guidance for the full year moving to expenses slide highlights total adjusted noninterest expense of million down million from the prior quarter and up million yearoveryear representing a increase we are very proud of the team for our prudent expense management in a challenging operating environment where production volumes have declined we have implemented head count reduction strategies and discretionary spend has been reduced across the organization in addition as we have said before our incentive plan alignment allows for expense flexibility in times when revenues are under pressure we will continue to operate with heightened expense discipline in the nearterm and adapt our expense base to maintain a competitive overall efficiency ratio synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 moving to slide on credit quality overall credit performance continues to perform in line with expectations as evidenced by the relatively stable life of loan loss expectations in the allowance calculation as we saw last quarter the basis points increase in the allowance was a result of modest deterioration in the forecasted economic outlook the quality of our originations remain strong and the impact of a few credit downgrades were offset by improvements in the performance of the aggregate loan portfolio as we look to the second half of we expect credit costs to remain manageable with expected full year chargeoffs of to basis points reflecting a second half chargeoff range of to basis points we continue to have confidence in the strength and quality of our portfolio we do not see any specific industry or sector stress within our loan book and we will continue to apply our conservative underwriting practices and advance market analytics to both new loan originations and portfolio monitoring and management as seen on slide our capital position continued to grow in the second quarter with the common equity tier ratio reaching and with total riskbased capital now at our organic earnings profile supported capital accretion in  which along with a somewhat slower pace of loan growth was more than sufficient to offset marginal headwinds from the consolidation of our qualpay investment as we look ahead we remain focused on eclipsing the cet1 threshold at which time we intend to reassess the broader macroeconomic environment and consider what actions if any may be prudent as we diligently manage our capital position to the interest of all stakeholders ill now turn it back to kevin to discuss our guidance kevin s blair chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp thank you jamie now ill continue with our updated guidance for the quarter before we review the details its worth noting that outside of loan growth the ranges provided do not reflect the impact of the impending fdic special assessment nor the impact of the medical office cre sale as the transaction is yet to be settled as you can see on slide the changes in the operating environment that have impacted the industry over the last days are reflected in our revised guidance loan growth is now expected to be to for the year this reduced guidance is due to lower anticipated production volume as well as the impact of the expected medical office cre sale despite lower demand and a higher hurdle rate for new business we continue to have growth oriented lines of business such as middle market and cib which we expect to produce strong second half growth we expect core deposit growth to increase to driven by the previously mentioned seasonal tailwinds and new growth initiatives the adjusted revenue growth outlook of to aligns with an fomc that reaches a target rate of and holds through the end of the year changes to the revenue guidance are the result of lower loan growth expectations and overall deposit betas which are now expected to reach to by year end we expect to expense growth in while the environment has resulted in some strategic shifts in priorities we remain confident in our growth strategies including maast and cib but have applied additional discipline across the entire expense base to better manage levels of growth over the course of the year we have significantly reduced our guidance range and when adjusting for new growth initiatives as well as uncontrollable environmental costs such as fdic and healthcare our core expense base is expected to be flat to up year overyear moving to capital as we previously communicated we are targeting a cet1 ratio above at this time we continue to believe it is prudent to build a larger capital buffer and we intend to continue to build capital levels synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 through year end through the retention of organic capital generation and slowing balance sheet growth lastly we expect our full year tax rate to be near the midpoint of our previous guidance range of to supported by new federal tax investments which will go into effect in the second half of the year our commitment to agility and responsiveness will be instrumental in navigating the everevolving landscape as we continue to focus on growing tangible book value we also recognize an opportunity to rightsize our balance sheet for sustainable profitable growth our medical office transaction announced this quarter is an example of diligent balance sheet management optimization efforts where we free up capital and liquidity to pursue higher returning more expandable relationships as we move forward we remain steadfast in our dedication to managing expenses and leveraging other strategic measures to perform optimally in the current environment by staying adaptable and resilient we are confident in our ability to achieve sustainable growth and to deliver value to our shareholders customers and communities alike and now operator lets open up the call for qa question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions the first question is from the line of steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please go ahead your line is open steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everybody kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc lets start on the updated revenue guide hi so the environment is tough i dont know if its that much tougher than we thought it was a quarter ago whats really changed to drive the revenue outlook moving down to the to range andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah steven this is jamie thanks for the question as we look at the revenue outlook for compared to what we said in april its really two different components on the asset side you have a couple some positives we expect spread revenue to remain high and that going on spreads to remain at these elevated levels but we do have the impact of lower loan growth and some of that is environmental due to the economy and part of it is due to the sale of that medical office cre portfolio on the liability side of the balance sheet you have the impact synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 of further deposit mix headwinds and thats really due to the decline in noninterestbearing deposits thats above prior expectations steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay and then jamie to followup on that so basically indicating nim down about the same amount in the third quarter but then leveling out so should we think about this really the nim should bottom in the third quarter and then maybe be flat to up pass that and what are you assuming for noninterestbearing is that mix shift basically done once we get past the third quarter also thanks andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp we do expect as you said the margin to decline in the third quarter a little less than what we saw here in the second quarter and that does include continued remixing of the deposit base with further declines in nib to total deposits and weve tried to look at it in multiple ways its a hard thing to model given everything thats going on thats kind of outside of our control you think about the exogenous factors of the fed balance sheet and rate tightening and trillions of dollars in stimulus in a gdp growth environment and so we try to look at history and determine where its going to go unfortunately the prior tightening cycles dont give us a lot of insight the mid is probably best but it still wouldnt imply declines like what were seeing right now and i think a lot of that has to do with diminishment when we look at the cash flows of our clients and using the same analysis that weve spoken about in the past about credit we see that our client spend is the growth in it is declining and we think that our clients are being managing their cash flows and so we do expect to see some of that diminishment slow as we go through this year but we do expect to see declines heading into year end we expect about another decline in nib to total deposits and perhaps if rates stay high a little more decline maybe another percent in but thats how we are thinking about that mix but its probably one of the more uncertain pieces of the model as we look forward but were just trying to be conservative in how we look at it make sure that the guide we give is pretty clear in that regard steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it so even with a sustained remixing theres no benefit coming from the fixed assets repricing that nim should be relatively stable in is what youre saying andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah thats right thats right and so let me talk about that for a second as we look at the margin youll see the decline in the third quarter and then youre right we do expect relative stability but the benefit of fixed rate asset or exposure repricing will come through and here in it will likely be offset by the tail end of this deposit cost increase and then you start to get the benefit in but just to put numbers on that in any given month we expect approximately million of fixed rate loans to paid off or pay down and when you look at the impact of that as you go forward looking forward about a year theres about an basis point impact to the margin a year from now just due to the fixed rate loans repricing and thats mortgages plus commercial loans so we have that tailwind and thats excluding the benefit of securities which have a little bit slower pay down and hedges and we have another billion of hedges that mature in the first quarter as well synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 so youre right to point out that that is a tailwind and thats what well start to see in and we believe that thats going to be the platform for growth as we look at revenue going forward steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it thanks for all the color andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah operator our next question comes from the line of brady gailey with kbw brady please go ahead your line is now open brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you good morning guys kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning brady brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc so maybe just a little more color on why you guys are exiting the medical office space i heard the comments on the call about how its a low return business maybe just a little more color on what made that a low return business for you all and a little more color on why you made that move andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah brady thanks for the question first we are extremely pleased with this transaction and the performance of the team that built this business the pristine nature of the credit in this portfolio the medical office cre portfolio was evident really throughout the diligence process and it led to the strong pricing that we have on this portfolio but to your point this portfolio performed exactly as designed and it was a great asset for the bank in a zero interest rate environment where a high singledigit roe was accretive but in this environment with much higher interest rates our return requirements are a lot higher and as a part of all of our more broad balance sheet optimization efforts we determined that this portfolio was one that was not as core of a fit given that it has very low relationship value even though its pristine credit but a high singledigit roe and so it helped us achieve a few of our key strategic objectives first it accelerates the timing to our capital objectives that we believe position us really well for growth going forward second it improves our liquidity profile and it helps increase our core deposit funding percentages third these capital and liquidity benefits will really give us the platform for growth going forward synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 and it also reduces our cre office exposure the cost of this i mentioned high singledigit roe its really about a spread is the way to think about it and thatll be a headwind to us in the near term but longer term were convicted that we can go and build and grow core clients deep relationships that offset and exceed the lost nii from this portfolio brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then the million burden if you look at that on a pretax point of view i think its only like of the loans being sold so thats a pretty minimal loss there but i was wondering what was the reserve on that portfolio that reserve probably gets wiped out im just wondering what the overall loss was on selling those loans andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah brady we will put all that out there at closing but youre right to think that thats a net number and so we do feel good about it is a little less than the you mentioned but its a net number and we will put out all the details of the economics at closing brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then just finally its great to see qualpay close i know thats probably beneficial to maast can you just remind us the benefit that that has on maast and with that business now closed does your outlook for maast change at all kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp brady qualpay is the front end for our payment facilitation platform so that we can process payments through the maast platform and so weve been very clear that having a majority ownership interest in qualpay allows us to ensure that the capital thats provided to our platform is their number one priority so it is great to have it closed it has a minimal impact to our pl but it has a big impact as we continue to expand the capabilities and functionalities of maast when we started this program a little over a year ago what we said is we would get into and we would start to pilot with a couple software vendors well were up to three partners that are onboard today and we also have five others that have signed on so well have a total of eight that will be on the platform with five additional software vendors in the contract phase today so that could take us to as many as software vendors that are signing onto the platform so i think weve confirmed our initial hypothesis that maast would be a product that is highly desirable by these software vendors just based on the interest and the individuals that have signed up to this point but i think its premature to talk about what the revenue is going to be from those software vendors because were still finalizing the mvp product and that will be rolled out more broadbased at the end of this quarter to all of those eight software vendors that have signed up and then the final stage which will determine how fast the revenue grows will be the end user adoption so those clients that are using the software will they leave deposits on the platform will they sign up for the money movement capabilities and eventually the lending capabilities but having qualpay finalize ensures that a big synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 component of the capabilities within the platform we have control over not only whats there today but the ultimate advancement and development on that platform brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay got it thanks for the color andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thanks brady operator our next question comes from the line of stephen scouten with piper sandler stephen please go ahead your line is now open stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co yeah thanks guys good morning i just wanted to follow up on the earlier conversation about kind of balance sheet trends around the noninterestbearing i know thats really hard to predict in this environment but you did note that average balances have declined a little bit im curious if you have some more detail around that what those average balances look like now maybe to precovid and kind of how we can think about the room for potential normalization there kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp yes stephen its a great point and to jamies point theres so many variables that go into determining what the terminal level is going to be with noninterestbearing if you look at our consumer operating accounts the average balance declined about quarteronquarter and that puts it back at about higher than where it was prior to covid and if you think about those balances on an inflation adjusted basis it would lead you to believe that were largely back to where we were precovid on the commercial side we saw about a decline quarteronquarter in average balance but theyre still about higher than they were precovid so you can look at that in two different ways number one i do believe that weve been increasing the average size of our deposits in commercial just based on our middle market and cib strategy so the production that weve had since covid has brought on larger deposits so i would expect that the average deposit to increase two i think our clients are carrying extra cash especially as we enter uncertainty in this economic environment so some of that will stick but three it would lead you to believe theres probably still a little excess cash thats sitting on our commercial operating account balances and you could continue to see some diminishment there and thats why i think jamie when he went through our analysis for the rest of the year we would expect there to be a little more decline in the percentage of total deposits in nib stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co got it thats really good color kevin appreciate that and then i guess maybe at just a high level question for you guys as you think about your business how have things changed maybe at a high level if theres one or two things you could highlight since february i mean obviously we know theres tons of funding pressure and sustaining your clients is different but we get all these questions about regional banks wont be able to make any synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 money the whole business model is dead can you kind of give us some color on why thats not true and kind of what has changed or what hasnt kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp well look ill tell you what hasnt changed is our value proposition to our clients and stephen when you go back to last quarter when we talk about being recognized by jd power as being the number one bank in the southeast for client service and trust i think it gets back to the heart of why clients choose banks and the primacy that we bring to the table they want folks that provide great service and they want advice and were going to continue to provide that i think what gets lost in all of this is whats happening today is just a contraction in margin and unfortunately in our business were not like manufacturing when we get an increased cost for our cost of goods we cant just pass that on to the clients a lot of our loans are already on the balance sheet and so having a little bit of margin contraction is not something thats new to this industry its been happening over the last really years and so i dont think theres anything out of the ordinary i dont think regional banks are experiencing any greater margin contraction obviously the big banks have a little bit of a advantage as it relates to scale and funding but i think when we get through this next quarter as jamie just talked about and margin stabilize were right back to where we started which is whos going to win market share whos going to grow its those banks that are providing the best level of service theyre providing the client experience and are winning market share and i think we were doing that before and i think well do it again on the other side and the contraction story will be one thats kind of one of history the other question mark that i thinks out there is credit so when we get to the other side of whatever this cycle is and we prove out the credit cycle and ive said from day one that i feel like theres going to be winners and losers in this environment based on where your portfolio sits what geography and what asset classes youre in and so when we get through that side you hear a lot of the rhetoric that regional banks are carrying a lot of the cre and a lot of negativity there so between margin contraction and the credit story i think that just has to play out and it feels like it is playing out and we get to the other side well be back to one of growth story and client primacy stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co thats great great answer kevin going to lay that one out for cnbc later today too well all appreciate it thanks for the time kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp ill do that operator our next question comes from the line of kevin fitzsimmons with da davidson kevin please go ahead your line is open kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst d a davidson co hey good morning everyone synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning kevin kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst d a davidson co was just hoping one thing i noticed was in your prior guidance slide you addressed ppnr growth and you dont have that in this slide is that simply because its sort of implied that thats going down with the revenue guidance or did you want to address that andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thats right thats right i mean we by giving the expense guide the revenue guide its implied and also its just theres so many different iterations of what can happen between those two line items that we didnt think it was as useful as it was last quarter but i do want to while were talking about ppnr i want to speak for a second about expenses because our expense guide is important to us and when you look at kind of how weve progressed through this year on expenses we started the year with a guide that was a lot higher than where we are right now is to and as we think about the growth there in the very beginning of the year we started to read the tea leaves look forward and see that the environment was deteriorating and so we started cutting back on our initiatives cutting back on our spend and that led to the reduction in the guide last quarter and then you see the reduction in the guide this quarter and when i say reduction it looks like its the same but were also including the approximate million impact of qualpay to the expense line this quarter that was not in the guide last quarter so we feel good about that component of our guide especially especially when you take into account that about of expense growth comes from growth initiatives and then other environmental costs like the fdic increase this year and healthcare costs and so thats something that we spend a lot of time on working on our expense base being efficient and i think thats an important part of the story when you think about ppnr yearoveryear kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst d a davidson co so jamie when youre so youre saying that to its staying the same but this bullet point over this assumption over to the right of the new initiatives fdic and healthcare costs and these other core operating expenses were not necessarily in the prior guide but youre finding ways to offset it is that what youre saying andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp no no no im saying that what was not in the prior guide is the impact of qualpay the other growth initiatives were in the guide in january as well as the guide in april but what i would say on the growth initiatives is those initiatives have been trimmed down a little bit individually and in various ways as we progress through this environment and so the spend on both maast and cib is a little bit less than what we guided to in january but the only change in those spends from april was really just the qualpay addition synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst d a davidson co understood okay and one quick followon some banks are talking about or that are evaluating potential bond transactions where you would take some kind of upfront loss but then you would be able to put those proceeds to work at higher rates and or pay down debt i would suspect that with your goal of getting to the cet1 maybe thats not something thats nearterm until you get to that point but is that something you guys are evaluating and in over what timeframe thanks kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp its a great question as we look at our bond portfolio first off in aggregate the duration and the paybacks too long to consider a transaction like that and youre right and you can see this through our mob transaction its our intent to accrete capital at the moment we remain really excited about with the opportunities thats in front of us in the southeast to drive client growth and thats our highest and best use of capital and so were not that interested in realizing a loss in the securities portfolio to mark the yieldtomarket at the moment kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst d a davidson co okay thanks very much operator our next question comes from the line of jared shaw with wells fargo jared please go ahead your line is now open jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey good morning thanks kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc just following up on the loan sales the participations in the medical offices is that the end of loan sales at this point and what are the uses of funds for these from the proceeds or should we just assume that the that wholesale fhlb is paid down or whats the use of funds there andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp were not anticipating further loan sales truthfully thats not something that we would anticipate in normal course of business outside of the thirdparty portfolio typically in an especially in an environment like this the best course of action for a business that may have a lower return than what youre targeting would be just to let it attrite and that would be a normal course of business is let the loans pay off at par and move on and free up the balance sheet that way and thats the traditional way to exit a high performing business like the medical office that was just a unique one that the credit quality was so pristine that we were able to get what we believed was a very fair synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 price for that portfolio and with regards to the use of bonds youre right it will go to pay down just more expensive funding whether thats fhlb or broker deposits it will likely be one of those two jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc and that million that you call out thats net of the paydowns or thats just the million hit from losing the loans and then we could see an offset on the funding andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp mark thats the mark thats the price mark effectively on the loan sale jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it got it okay and then on credit as we look at the trends with the expectation for higher net chargeoffs going into the end of the year whats driving that higher levels of expected loss and as we sort of flip the calendar into is that trend do you expect that trend to increase and continue going into next year robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp yeah hey jared this is bob just as jamie mentioned i mean youre going to see a slight drift up in chargeoffs and in credit metrics in general within and again we would expect that the drivers are not anything systemic its just a pressure that our clients continue to feel and some of them with more leverage are certainly feeling it more than others but that will push chargeoffs and nonaccruals slightly up we certainly increased this quarter that was a just a couple of credits that happened to fall in the same quarter we dont see it coming from any specific industry or any specific asset class but we do see just general credit pressure i dont like the term normalization but certainly in the environment were in we should expect credit to kind of ease up as it relates to the credit cost in total and thats what we saw and thats what we expect to see in the third and fourth quarter weve done a lot of deep dives into these portfolios and really feel good about our guide of sort of basis points to basis points in the back half of the year coming off a very low pretty low base in the first half still landed us in that sort of high basis points or so for the year as far as is concerned well get more specific on that in january as we talk about our guidance but i mean the general feel is overall its kind of more of the same at least in the near term jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay all right thanks and when you look at that allowance ratio tied in with that going up a couple of basis points this quarter so is that still sort of marching higher or given the expectation the broader economic expectations today that thats maybe a stable level robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp yeah as we look forward clearly we think were adequately reserved today feel good about the allowance i would point out that embedded in the allowance this quarter we do have a weighting to that stagflation scenario which is pretty onerous we dont show economic data for that forecast synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 but unemployment rate starts to approach at the end of that forecast which is a pretty high number and so thats embedded in our allowance this quarter as we look forward could we see it continue to increase slightly i think that thats fair but it could also remain at current levels and it would just be dependent on the economic outlook and the portfolio performance jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you operator our next question comes from manan gosalia with morgan stanley please go ahead manan your line is now open manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning i had more of a bigger picture question on credit just based on your conversations with clients what impact have percentage points and more of higher rates had on middle market and small business balance sheets and what do you think their appetite is to absorb these interest costs if rates stay higher for longer through robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp yeah thanks for the question manan this is bob again overall we do a commercial client survey and ill point to that first and weve been doing that for several quarters now and that survey gives us a lot of good data points and what its generally telling us is that our clients are starting to feel marginally worse about the future expectations of their business but not materially so its in keeping with this inflation rate being higher its in keeping with their cost and input cost being higher longer and some potential pressure on their revenue line so we certainly are tracking that that matches up with what cal and his team are doing with our cash inflows and outflow analysis and that algorithm so weve got a lot of data points generally speaking we think there is some pressure particularly on smaller businesses as they just dont have the access to the capital that a larger credit would as it relates to middle market i mean certainly it depends certainly on the industry and the effects of covid or the longerterm effects of what covid may have on those industries but overall its just general margin pressure that we continue to see in a slightly worsening environment that we expect it to kind of continue as long as we stay at this level thats what our surveys are telling us thats what our analytics are telling us and anecdotally thats what our discussions with our clients are telling us andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp and then bob just to add to that when you talk to clients i mean it obviously has had an impact on pipelines going into this year were down but weve seen a stabilization of pipelines so it feels like the reduction in demand that we saw in the first quarter has stabilized and you think about some of our clients who have been able to pass on that higher cost on to their clients and thats what weve seen through much of the cycle the synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 challenge becomes to bobs point is when you have increased input cost and you no longer can pass that price increase on to your clients and given where inflation has been and given the consumer and the health of the consumer i think were getting to a point where it becomes harder and harder to pass it on and so i think that leads to lower demand but ultimately it leads as bob said to lower margins but in general if you look at it kind of a throughthecycle many of these small businesses and commercial clients still look very healthy as it relates to their historical returns manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and then separately i know you dont fall in the category of banks that regulators are most focused on for new regulation but im assuming that the supervision process will get guided for banks of all asset sizes so noted your loan sale this quarter and your comments that you want to keep accreting capital at least for the near term but in terms of the overall balance sheet and capital and liquidity are you doing anything else to prepare for the tighter regulatory environment robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp theres nothing else that we are working on right now from a capital and liquidity i mean think when you look at our strategic plan what youll see is we will be building capital and improving our liquidity positioning now we feel very comfortable with our liquidity where it is right now you see billion of contingent liquidity but we also believe that we can improve the positioning and reduce the overall cost of our funding as well and thats something youll see over the next couple years and so thats just going to be part of our strategy part of our strategic plan if you look at the leadership team that kevin has built here the leadership team especially in the corporate services theres a lot of large bank history and you think about whats coming down the pipeline to billion and higher banks most people here have lived that breathed it and we know what it takes and so its already part of our nature its part of how we manage the bank when we look at scenario analysis we look at risk management its how we manage our daytoday so for us thats not regardless of the change officially its not a big change in how we operate daytoday the only thing that i would say that is a debate for us and it doesnt impact us is the potential impact of aoci on capital for the banks over billion it will be interesting to see how that plays out but if indeed how the maturity is excluded from that then thats something that we will have to consider is how do we leverage indiscernible maturity designation because its not something that we use today manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you operator our next question comes from brandon king with truist securities brandon please go ahead your line is open brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey good morning synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning brandon brandon king q analyst truist securities inc so i wanted to talk about the core deposit guide and just wanted to get your expectations as far as what kind of percentage contribution do you expect from seasonal benefits versus the new deposit initiatives kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp well look its true brandon that when you look at the fourth quarter specifically theres usually seasonal inflows both on the public fund side as well as generally the commercial side so i think its what we said to this point is that weve been focusing on new deposit production our production on a yeartodate basis is up over where it was in we believe that will continue and yes some of that has come in our cd promotions and the like but its really up across all of our lines of business number two we continue to focus on the blocking and tackling which just means that were using analytics and sweat equity to reach out to existing relationships to ensure that we have a full share wallet we talked earlier this year about changing incentive plans to align the banks interests with our relationship managers and we think that also pays dividends and will continue into the third and fourth quarter weve onboarded a new liquidity product specialist who will focus in kind of the large corporate middle market space and bringing in larger deposit opportunities and well continue with some of our promotions that we have out there today so seasonality is something that we are counting on but its not the only reason that were growing we think that the other half of the story is really around the production that will continue into the second half of the year brandon king q analyst truist securities inc got it and with the new deposit initiatives just could you give us kind of a big picture view strategically on how you think that will play into potentially next year as far as being able to drive deposit growth maybe higher than what has been historically kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp well look it will definitely be higher than it was this last year i can tell you that because with all the diminishment that weve had that jamie talked about earlier our story is not one of production its been a story of diminishment and with all these excess balances sitting on the balance sheet its hard to overcome the reduction in the average balances and i think as weve talked about that abating the production will obviously be much more impactful in terms of growing deposits and so what wed love to be able to see coming out of the other side of the diminishment story is a production level that closely mirrors that of loan production so to jamies point we believe that we can reduce our wholesale funding in the coming quarters and we feel very good about our loantodeposit ratio today which is under and going forward if we match our deposit growth with our loan growth we feel very good about not only the margin impact of that but ultimately our ability to continue to fund our growth story as we look into and synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 brandon king q analyst truist securities inc got it thats all i had thanks for taking my questions kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp thank you operator our next question comes from the line of brody preston with ubs brody please go ahead your line is now open brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning everyone andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc i wanted just to ask on the jamie can you help me just on the derivative hedge portfolio the rate thats been pretty consistent for the last several quarters is that a net rate i guess is that net of what youre paying on the floating and receiving on the fixed or can you help me better understand the moving parts there andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp that is the received fixed rate versus so we will be receiving fixed at and then we pay on the index on the other side so historically indiscernible brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp more on the floating rate libor on those indiscernible brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay so thats probably sofr i guess at this point okay cool and then just on i appreciated the slide i think it was slide or so i think you had tucked in the repricing dynamics on the fixed rate portfolio i just wanted to focus in on the nonmortgage portion that 23year duration is that a good cadence to use in terms of even repricing from the fixed rate loan perspective or is there any kind of chunky periods of fixed rate loan repricing within there synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp theres no real chunky portions of that its actually fairly steady brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay okay so that should just be consistent repricing going forward all right cool and then i just wanted to sneak in one last one just on the deposit outlook i think on one of the slides you said that you expected i think it was to total deposit beta range through december so that kind of calls for a bit of a step up in the back half i was just wondering how competition is evolving in the southeast markets especially now that fhn is back fully competing for deposits with everyone kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp so brody let me take the competition ill let jamie talk about the betas so it was interesting when we go back and look at our competitive data in the second quarter what we saw was for the first time that weve been tracking this that we had multiple banks that had cd promotions that were higher than the brokered rates and i wont mention the names you know who they are so that did drive up the cost of promotional cd production number two when you look at the change in the standard rates for just money market both on the consumer and on the commercial side we saw on average about a to basis point increase in standard rates in the second quarter if you compare that to the first quarter where we actually saw more rate hikes it was only up about basis points so what we saw in the competitive landscape was a movement on standard rates in the second quarter and i think thats whats driving a lot of the deposit beta discussion but ill let jamie talk about our forecast a big piece of that is the nib remix andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thats right thats right i mean as we think about deposit cost movements from the month of june that you see in our presentation to the end of the year we do expect to see a fairly steady just monthly step down in the rate of increase of total deposit cost and so thats how we think it will play out and youll see that steadily decline sort of approach zero at the end of the year and brody to your prior question ill point back to an answer i gave earlier about the on the fixed rate loans thats the million that we have each month that is maturing or paying down this repricing brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you very much guys i really appreciate it andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah operator this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to mr kevin blair for any closing remarks synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 kevin s blair
