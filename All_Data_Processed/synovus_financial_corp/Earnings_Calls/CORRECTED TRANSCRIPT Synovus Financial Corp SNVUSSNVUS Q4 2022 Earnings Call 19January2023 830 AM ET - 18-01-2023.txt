kevin blair will provide an overview of the quarter kevin s blair president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp thank you cal in many regards was a banner year for synovus we began last year with an investor day which affirmed to the market who we are and detailed our path forward to become a more innovative resilient and highperforming bank as the year progressed we faced an increasingly volatile operating environment however our team rose to the challenge continuing to execute the plan laid out in february given our strong footprint the ability to monetize rising rates and the performance of our business units weve demonstrated throughout our ability to execute and deliver profitable growth resulting in top quartile return on average asset and efficiency ratio levels as compared to our peers we achieved the success while also investing in the future and pivoting where needed to address the changing economic liquidity and credit landscape i want to thank our team for delivering on our purpose again in enabling people to reach their full potential feedback through sources like jd power is showing record client satisfaction scores and awards from greenwich associates for excellence in service to middle market and small business clients prove we remain trusted partners to a growing and loyal legacy client base across our geography credit for this kind of recognition goes to this exceptional team and our ongoing investments in strong scalable capabilities and solutions that add value todays report is shaped by continued growth and stability in our core banking franchise given our ability to deepen the wallet share of existing clients and consistently attracting new relationships we are also benefiting from investments in technology process improvement and innovation as well as a common sense approach to expense credit and capital management for these reasons we exit a stronger company with a tremendous amount of momentum as we continue to execute on our road map which will allow us to deliver sustainable top quartile financial performance now lets review and fourth quarter highlights on slide and we realized robust revenue growth in as net interest income expansion was fueled by doubledigit loan growth and our overall asset sensitivity given rising rates a challenging mortgage environment pressured fee income however excluding mortgage client fee income collectively increased high single digits on a fullyear basis signaling the depth and breadth of our core client relationships our efforts to double down on the commercial client segment is producing outsized growth as our commercial lines of business generated billion in loan growth all at higher spreads while adhering to our conservative credit standards to that point credit metrics improved over the year and currently stand at or near historically low npa npl and nco levels we applied the same disciplined approach to capital management growing capital in the quarter and ending the year with a cet ratio of our twoyear synovus forward initiative surpassed its million run rate goal in the fourth quarter and although the initiative is complete the emphasis on expense control and efficient revenue growth is more deeply synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 ingrained in our culture and we identify and act regularly on new opportunities to generate incremental value to our financial performance despite increasing pricing pressures on the deposit side we managed deposit cost well throughout the year benefiting from prudent strategy and an extended lag on deposit repricing overall deposit production rose for the year and was sourced from multiple lines of business i was especially pleased with our sales efforts in the fourth quarter as our teams increased sales activity resulting in an overall growth of million in new production quarteroverquarter the operating environment for deposits remain competitive with the retention of client balances and growth and new production remaining primary focuses in while delivering great financial performance during the year we also continued to make progress with the development and rollout of the key initiatives that will allow us to deliver new sources of revenue in and well into the future cib continues to prudently grow and execute reaching team members in the fourth quarter and booking their first capital market fees and depository relationships maast also reached a key milestone as they are live with their first client and have booked revenue during the month of january on the treasury and payment side we fully completed our client migrations into the new gateway portal and went live with our new foreign exchange platform we continue to see traction with the investments were making in treasury and payment solutions as the growth in production and the associated revenue continues to outpace the underlying markets and our peer benchmarks in order to continue to increase the capacity of our commercial relationship managers while improving the client experience we are also investing in new technology and reengineering our processes to streamline the client underwriting and onboarding experience on the consumer side we further streamlined our branch network by closing locations during the year while investing in analytics and digital capabilities to ensure we continue to efficiently and effectively serve our targeted client base simply was a year of progress across our entire organization i am extremely proud of our team and their accomplishments and encouraged by our positioning as we enter jamie will now share greater detail on the key activities and financial results for the fourth quarter jamie andrew jamie gregory jr executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thank you kevin id like to begin with loan growth as seen on slide total loan balances ended the fourth quarter at billion reflecting quarterly growth of billion on an annualized basis excluding ppp this represents a growth rate of our sixth consecutive quarter of annualized doubledigit loan growth growth was again led by our commercial lines of business and was diversified across multiple industries and segments for both ph cie and cre asset types growth as a function of moderated production and low levels of paydowns and payoffs particularly for transactiondriven sectors such as cre and corporate ma activity and pipelines remain muted as a result of the current environment in addition current underwriting standards account for higher risk in certain sectors and where we are extending credit we have been able to exercise greater pricing power to drive margins as reflected by increasing spreads on new floating rate commercial production in the fourth quarter synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 moving to slide the industry wide headwind for deposit growth remained in the fourth quarter as continued interest rate hikes seasonal spending and other liquidity deployment drove account diminishment despite these pressures we were able to grow core deposit balances which increased by million quarteronquarter this growth was a combination of a bank wide focus on new deposit production and seasonal benefits from public funds as evidence of the positive momentum we have around deposit production when looking at the fourth quarter new production excluding public funds increased over from  our recent efforts both to generate and retain deposits have been encouraging and our focus is on maintaining that positive momentum within what remains a challenging deposit environment to that end we will continue to ensure that we have balance between prudently managing deposit costs while remaining competitive through this fomc tightening cycle our average cost of deposits increased basis points in the fourth quarter to which equates to a total deposit beta of through  as a result of pricing discipline and continued pricing lag this beta continues to remain lower than the to range we have previously communicated as our base case for total deposit betas this rate cycle with recent deposit pricing pressures and a fed funds rate that appears likely to approach in we still believe that well reach this range as the cycle matures now to slide disciplined deposit pricing loan growth and interest rate increases led to growth in net interest income in the fourth quarter nii came in at million an increase of quarteronquarter or versus same quarter one year ago the growth in nii for  is supported by both higher loan yields which continue to outpace deposit calls and the consistent pace of loan growth which i spoke to earlier the net interest margin was in the fourth quarter an increase of basis points quarteronquarter supporting them are higher asset yields which continue to increase alongside the recent pace of fomc rate hikes and are supported by spread widening and the continued growth in our floating rate loan portfolio our funding calls have also increased the pace of increases in deposit rates has remained somewhat more consistent and measured than that of the asset side this time it served to be a significant tailwind to the margin as we progressed through as we look forward to the coming quarters and approach what is likely the latter phase of the fed tightening cycle nim is expected to be more heavily impacted by the delayed effects of deposit repricing assuming rates remain relatively stable from current levels over the mediumterm the margin will be supported by fixedrate asset turnover and hedge maturity and as we enter nii will continue to be supported by expected loan growth and pricing discipline slide shows total adjusted noninterest revenue of million down million from the previous quarter and down million when compared to the same period in negatively impact in  fee income were two tax related valuation adjustments which in combination totaled approximately million and were partially offset by benefits recognized in the tax provision outside of these taxrelated valuation adjustments we recorded another strong quarter of noninterest revenue on the wealth side revenue generated from clients movement in the shortterm investment has provided a positive offset to industry deposit pressures on the commercial side increasing client privacy continues to be a synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 key strategic focus we can point to progress made this year with syndication fees of on a fullyear basis despite a challenging capital markets environment on the card side we crossed a noteworthy threshold as commercial card spend exceeded billion contributing to a increase in fullyear card fees commercial analysis fees are also gaining momentum with strong pipelines heading into moving on to expenses slide highlights total adjusted noninterest expense of million up million from the prior quarter and up million from the same period in representing an yearoveryear increase when looking quarteroverquarter the majority of our expense growth was attributable to performancerelated costs investments in new business initiatives and infrastructure spend all previously disclosed as planned increases in  similar factors drove yearoveryear expense increases in our top quartile efficiency ratio of for the year highlights our alignment between performance and the expense growth next to slide on credit quality our credit performance and the credit quality of our originations remain strong the npa and npl ratios remain stable overall and are at or near historically low levels the net chargeoff ratio was for the quarter in line with recent levels in the fourth quarter our acl was million or of loans as detailed in the appendix given continued loan growth the acl increased million quarteronquarter while the acl ratio remained relatively stable this ratio reflects the positive performance of the loan portfolio offset by a negative bias influencing economic scenario metrics for and we are confident in the composition diversification and strength of our loan portfolio as we recently discussed at industry conferences when looking further at our exposures that are more sensitive to recessionary pressures we remain convinced that our targeted and selective approach to industry and sector lending will provide protection from an economic downturn we also feel that we are wellpositioned to detect and respond to shifts in commercial loan performance through tools such as our clientspecific cash flow analytics originally introduced during the pandemic as seen on slide the common equity tier ratio increased to reflecting our commitment to retain our strong organic earnings to support core client loan growth while also maintaining strong capital levels for the year we deployed over of our organic earnings towards supporting core client growth while also returning roughly to our shareholders through our common dividend both consistent with the capital management priorities we detailed during our investor day looking into we will continue to prioritize capital deployment toward client growth and we will remain mindful of the evolving economic environment as we manage within our target cet ratios additionally our planned quarterly dividend increase of to a share subject to board approval reflects our confidence in our stable earnings profile ill now turn it back to kevin to cover our guidance kevin s blair president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp thank you jamie given the more uncertain economic environment we have utilized wider ranges on estimates and have shared more detail on the assumptions supporting these estimates we expect loan growth of to in while lower levels of pipeline activity in some business units and a rundown in our thirdparty portfolio will act as headwinds synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 we have a number of existing businesses with strong pipelines as well as newer lines of business such as cib that will support overall growth exceeding that of the general economy we are also assuming a normalization of prepayment activity and utilization levels that are consistent with those experienced in its also worth noting that pricing discipline is a key focus in the current environment where pricing power continues to improve and we therefore expect wider spreads to persist in the adjusted revenue growth outlook of to aligns with an fomc rate that reaches approximately in the wide revenue range accounts for less certainty in the deposit environment on the fee income side we expect midsingle digit growth driven by continued expansion in core client fee income impacting fee income or checking account enhancements planned to be implemented in the first half of the year that is estimated to negatively impact annual service charge revenues by approximately million to million on the adjusted expense outlook of to the yearoveryear growth is a function of three primary drivers first approximately of the growth in is associated with core operating expenses secondly we have two sizable environmental factors affecting our expense outlook healthcare cost and the rise in the annual fdic assessment rate are collectively forecasted to account for of the overall growth lastly we remain committed to our investments in new initiatives such as cib and maast which in combination with other revenuebased investments and projects will comprise approximately of our expense growth however despite these expense headwinds we have found ways to prudently trim costs and we are benefiting from a full year of synovus board expense saves that will allow us to drive overall positive operating leverage and ppnr growth of to moving to capital as jamie shared we plan to maintain our same capital management philosophy in with a focus on prioritizing core relationship growth and maintaining a strong capital position all while providing shareholders with a competitive dividend while our board approved a million authorization for the year as was the case for any share repurchases will be dependent upon loan growth and the overarching economic factors lastly while we dont talk about it often our tax rate guide of to accounts for a number of successful initiatives that we have implemented in recent years from affordable housing to solar tax credits these initiatives offset forecasted negative headwinds in and serve a dual purpose of consistently reducing our tax rate while also benefiting our communities given our focus on driving actions associated with our esg objectives our strong momentum has carried as well through the first few weeks of the new year and we are so proud of the accomplishments that resulted in solid financial performance and meaningful progress in nearly every area of our transformational growth plan we are confident in our strategic plan and our ability to hit key financial targets outlined today even as we navigate the volatile economic terrain is a year of focused execution for our team as we emphasize investments and pour our energy into three key areas first advancing successful execution and productivity gains within our core businesses allowing us to deepen relationships grow our client base and enhance financial performance growth in core businesses enables us to invest in new and future sources of growth including maast cib and new treasury and payment solutions secondly continuing to benefit from contributions generated by our new growth initiatives and adding talent in key businesses and markets to expand our presence and profitability and then lastly maintaining a synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 cautious and resilient risk profile through capital management deposit generation across all lines and overall credit vigilance as we head into the qa segment i want to thank our incredibly talented and passionate team again and affirm our commitment to providing the best career and workplace experiences possible in we progressed in our dei efforts launched our new leadership development program increased base pay and enhanced incentive plans and enrich benefits like parental leave as a result synovus was again named a top workplace in atlanta and designated a great place to work but we cannot rest on our laurels were committed to listening and investing even more in to meet the needs and exceed the expectations of our workforce and i also want to mention a few examples of the success and achievements our lines of business delivered in our wholesale banking team delivered record results representing the largest growth engine for the company billion of funded loan production billion of deposits acquired and million in fee income highlighted the year we also on boarded new team members to support future growth by focusing on empowering our local leaders our community bank returned to a growth orientation in with both commercial and private wealth loan portfolios growing for the first time in many years moreover our geographic banking units continue to serve as a portal of entry and a primary referral source with over referrals made to other lines of business our wealth management units including securities and trust grew fee income million or in a year with significant headwinds from lower equity markets however the teams were able to overcome this given strong new client acquisition and the expansion of existing relationships as referenced earlier treasury and payment solutions increased production and fees significantly in driven by success in core cash management solutions as well as commercial card and international services and our consumer line of business optimized our branch network by closing of our facilities while expanding our digital and analytical capabilities which resulted in a more efficient and scalable organization with disciplined deposit pricing and high singledigitloan growth the consumer line of business expanded their ppnr by double digits and certainly none of these lines of business results would be possible without the hard work and dedication of our corporate services support team lastly im pleased with our efforts to build and strengthen our communities we launched a meaningful partnership with junior achievement in mid2022 one component of more than million and volunteer hours invested in our communities across the southeast with that operator now lets open the line for questions synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 question and answer section operator we will now begin our qa session operator instructions at this time we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster okay so our first question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan your line is open please go ahead steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi good morning everyone kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp good morning steven andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning steven steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc wanted to start first on the loan outlook if i look at the loan outlook is very strong most banks are guiding to strong growth in average loans for but not strong growth in period end loans so im curious whats your assumption for the economy that underlies the forecast and what gives you so much confidence at this point that you could deliver midtohigh single digit growth in period end loans kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp steven its a combination of several factors to your point when we look at the economic forecast there are parts of the forecast that would show in the latter half of the year that you could see contraction in the economy but we believe in total that when you look at our ci pipelines first and foremost we think we will continue to see good growth on the ci front that comes from pipelines but it also comes from some of the newer businesses that weve just initiated like corporate and investment banking where we really dont have a portfolio to this point but well be able to continue to generate growth from the new production secondly we continue to see a constructive environment on the home equity side as well as on portfolio mortgages obviously that volume is down but when you look at the need for home equity product given rising interest rates we continue to see a good productive environment there the area that were seeing a decline is really on the cre side weve seen pipelines decline to and so when you think about this year compared to the real difference will be that ci will continue to grow in a doubledigit fashion consumer will be in that lower singledigit and then instead of being doubledigit for cre its going to be in the low singledigit for cre double digit for ci low singledigit for cre part of thats just due to the fact that pipeline is down but the other part is well start to see payoff and paydown activities really start to pick up in synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 so when we look at it by asset class and by business unit we have certain units that are continuing to see pipelines expand weve had others that contract but at the end of the day you kind of look at all of those youll see kind of a midsingledigit growth rate next year steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay indiscernible steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah the only thing i would add to that its just kind of our noncore thirdparty portfolio you should expect to see that attrite as we go through steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful jamie and then for my followup question i look at the net interest margin basically in line with expectations in terms of the expansion this quarter but given what youre seeing on the deposit side right you talked about further remix noninterest bearing jamie how do you see nim trending in at this stage i recognize it could change in a month but right now if you look at where you ended in the fourth quarter how do you think about nim for thank you andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah its a great question its kind of the milliondollar question as we look at we expect the margin to be down marginally from where we ended in the fourth quarter and basically what will play into that is in the first half of the year we do believe that we will see the pressure of deposit lags we expect like the quarters with the largest deposit cost increase to be the fourth quarter that we just experienced that were talking about today and the first quarter and so the first half of the year well see the margin headwinds associated with those lags but how this impacts the margin will depend on how long the lag is and how deposit cost increase as we go through it as you know longer lags and cost outperformance would be margin tailwinds and the opposite is true with shorter lags and higher cost our current expectation for the first quarter is that we see deposit cost increase at a little bit of a slower rate than we saw in the fourth quarter but we do expect to see in the back half of the year the nim headwinds that well see in the first half turn to tailwinds as our fixed rate exposures become a tailwind with repricing and all of this is contingent on the interest rate outlook and so our guidance today includes the fed going to approximately and holding there consistent with their outlook and so thats embedded into this forecast synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it great thanks for taking my questions andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thank you steven kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp thank you steven operator thank you our next question comes from brady gailey of kbw your line is now open please go ahead brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey thank you good morning guys andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp morning brady kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp good morning brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah maybe just to ask the net interest margin question a little differently i know last quarter we talked about nii dollars growing basically in sync with loan growth in is that still the right way to think about spread income dollars andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp you know as we look at nii looking through the full year of i would just call it uneven as we progressed through the year our base case for nii in the first quarter is for it to be similar to what we just experienced in the fourth quarter outside of the impact of day count and so for that for us thats about million but as we progressed through the year theres just a lot of uncertainty with monetary policy competitive pressures on deposit pricing and the timing lags so as we look at the full year compared to  annualized there are scenarios where you could have nii increasing and that would be driven by longer timing lags betas at the lower end of our guidance and our guidance hasnt changed through the cycle of to total deposit beta but and the converse is true to that faster repricing higher deposit betas would obviously be a headwind synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 but again like i just mentioned and the response to stevens question we do think that the pressures from deposit costs are going to really be the highest in the first half of the year but then we have those tailwinds that will flow through in the second half of the year kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp and brady ill state the obvious i mean you see it in the guidance but revenue growth of to obviously exceeding that of loan growth so for the full year jamies talking about relative to fourth quarter but fullyear margin will expand to so nii would actually be growing at a faster pace than what loans would be growing brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right thats helpful then my followup as i look at last year for synovus you had the investor day you ramped up synovus board you had the new initiatives from the corporate and investment bank and also maast theres a lot of kind of new things announced so as you look at will synovus continue to be announcing some new initiatives or is this more a we have ph or we have enough time to execute kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp so look i think brady you always have to have an eye on the future and looking for new sources of revenue so im sure that well have some new ideas and things that will begin to develop and initiate on but as we had in the back of the document this is really a year of focused execution we believe that weve made tremendous progress in core businesses and focusing on productivity gains and ensuring that were getting full share of wallet yeah i was really pleased to see as i said on the prepared remarks when you look at our deposit production in the fourth quarter total deposit production was about billion so first quarter i can remember that deposit production outpaced loan production we only had billion in loan production and so theres opportunities to continue to focus on our core businesses to ensure that were getting fulsome relationships and that were delivering the highest level of value to our clients and profitability the second part of that is making sure that some of these initiatives that we kicked off during investor day deliver obviously in our expense guide for we have a considerable amount about of the growth tied up with current initiatives and we believe that thats prudent to continue to invest there given that as we look at and and even the amount of revenue thats going to be produced by those initiatives will more than offset the expense and be a major driver in top line growth so we want to make sure we deliver on those but we have a sandbox and we need to think about what are the new items that we uncover as opportunities to generate growth or efficiencies and thats what we really talk about within synovus forward were not going to do a synovus forward but what we try to do is embed in our culture the idea of coming up with better ideas to both drive new sources of revenue and to find new efficiencies and thats just something that we have to do going forward given the economic volatility and challenges that well face synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay got it thanks guys operator thank you our next question is from the line of michael rose of raymond james your line is now open please go ahead michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning guys hope youre doing well kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp doing well michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc just wanted to touch on the okay thanks yeah just wanted to touch on the dividend increase i think that was probably a little bit larger than i would have thought i saw that you looks like you approved a million share repurchase program just wanted to get some details around that and kind of how active your plan could be as we move through the year just given that youre within your cet1 range thanks andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah as we think about the dividend policy we try to pay out to of our earnings to the dividend we think thats a good place to be we think its what is right for our shareholders but we really want to make sure that were retaining as much capital generated through our earnings for core client growth and we believe that that gives us that flexibility scenarios and scenarios where rates decline and the world changes as well as scenarios where we continue to grow and that economy remains strong so thats how we think about it with regards to the share repurchase program thats the same approval as we had in and as you know in we repurchased only million in shares but our expectation is that loan growth will be slower in and were starting the year at a higher cet1 ratio closer to the high end of the range so as we progress through this year were going to monitor our capital ratios were comfortable where we are and as we get to the top end of our range as we get to were going to revisit our share repurchase strategy and thats a point where you may see us out in the market buying shares michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc okay just to be clear thats a program just for this year right the million andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thats right synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc all right and then just as a separate followup question yeah i think theres been a lot in the news about commercial real estate and resets as properties come up for renewal theres an article in the journal about it today you know i often hear from some investors that theres some concern just you got some thirdparty loans you got a decent amount of commercial real estate obviously there were issues pre and going through the gfc can you just provide some kind of overall context around your philosophy around the credit portfolio maybe where youre pulling back and how investors can get more comfort just given all the changes that youve made over the years as we potentially go through another credit cycle thanks robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp hey michael its bob ill start with that and jamie or kevin can certainly follow but just maybe just quickly go back to what we said at investor day as it relates to sort of credit risk management obviously our intent was to spread the balance sheet out building out corporate specialty lines of business i think that was a key focus for us secondly was to stay diversified and within our concentration limits and to build those out i think thats been accomplished and then finally and probably most importantly was to make sure we built out robust credit shops within our lines of business in the first line of defense with our rms et cetera so weve got credit resources deeply allocated in our business unit so from a broad context that framework is what were operating under as it relates specifically to cre those same sort of overarching framework supply you know we stay balanced were not outsized necessarily we do have billion in office that gets a lot of attention but if you back out the medical component of thats about half within that category a large percentage is at or near hospitals universities so we like our office were not immune to whats going on in our office but we certainly are comfortable with where we are other asset classes are relatively balanced and on the ci front that balance continue so thats our guidance from credit as it relates to policy exceptions and managing within our policy we certainly are vigilant about that and we will continue to be so so i think its just more of the same but building it out at the front lines michael and continuing to execute on what we laid out in february as we go forward andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp and mike ill jump in a little bit here is i mean we have a very long history in cre and thats whats getting a lot of attention today and as you can see in the appendix of our deck on slide were trying to give investors the details they need to make their own assessment on the quality of the book because we feel very comfortable with where we are in an uncertain environment and thats why you see us looking at the average ltvs but also the higher ltvs anything and were using which is fairly conservative as a tranche just to give a look into our portfolio so investors and analysts can come to their own conclusions but we feel comfortable with our strategy is one we have a lot of history in and its going to be as part of who we were in the past and its going to be part of who we are in the future and we feel good about that but we try to give all the insights we can into that portfolio given the headlines synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp and michael a quick follow up to that were running internal stress tests constantly on our cre book and under severe adverse conditions et cetera and we like the way the results of those stress test we do it by asset category you know we stress a whole host of variables but suffice it to say that that works been done and we feel comfortable that the portfolio can absorb some stress again were not immune to credit challenges but we feel really good about the results of that michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc i appreciate all the color thanks for taking my questions operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jared shaw of wells fargo securities your line is now open please go ahead jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey good morning everybody kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp good morning andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc i guess just circling back on the deposits the beta performance has been pretty good so far as we look at that loan growth expectations should we assume that deposit growth will match that and maybe thats where were seeing the accelerated beta just bring those in and how should we be thinking about the level of dda under that environment as well andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah yeah its an a very important question as we look forward to and i just want to be really clear that as we think about our balance sheet growth in achieving the high end of our loan growth range requires stronger core deposit growth and so those do go handinhand but the environment is pretty uncertain and its too uncertain that precisely estimate fullyear core deposit growth but we do expect to continue to see the strong production weve seen in the past couple of quarters and our teams are focused weve increased the focus on the teams weve changed incentive plans we have deposit initiatives in flight and so we think that organic client deposit growth will materialize in on the environment side we do believe that diminishment will reduce as we go through similar to the trend of reduced diminishment weve synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 seen in third quarter and the fourth quarter we believe the stability and fed policy both on rate and balance sheet will allow for a more stable deposit environment so allinall our current expectation again which is uncertain that we expect core deposit growth to be in the low to midsingle digits for and we expect the pressures that we experience in the last year in to continue albeit a little smaller in the beginning of so growth is likely going to be weighted to the back half of the year kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp and so jared on the business front there so two sides of that equation as jamie mentioned were ramping up production on deposit side diminishment is starting to abate a bit its important to note when we look at the balances that we lose in a quarter about of the balances that we lose are with existing relationships so its not losing deposits its not closure its folks that are using their cash or in many situations that we had a record quarter in the fourth quarter of moving money off balance sheet again into treasuries on the securities side so theres a lot of money movement thats seeking yield and we think that will continue to slow that combined with increases in production will help to drive the production and growth that jamie talked about the other side of the equation is loan growth and i want to be clear that our job is as we said is to go out and deploy capital for our clients and so were going to continue to be open to originate loans and thats why our to guidance but the other thing we can do is as we come up on renewals of existing loans or we look at certain asset classes we may make the decision that given our cost of funding we may not renew the loan if were not getting the right level of profitability or particular asset classes we may decide to downsize similar to what weve done with thirdparty given the underlying profitability with wholesale funding so i think you have to look at both sides of it but we obviously are focused on generating faster growth on the core deposit side and continuing to serve our clients but we have about billion of contingent liquidity through securities and through fhlb so we really dont have a funding problem we have a challenge to make sure that that funding comes on as cheaply as we can get it andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp and to circle back to the nib question as i mentioned theres a lot of uncertainty in the outlook but within products i would argue that the uncertainty increases as an industry weve seen a significant trend of clients taking advantage of rates and switching out the dda we expect that to continue in and thats embedded in our outlook its embedded in our beta assumptions of through the cycle betas but were also expecting to see continued strong client growth in dda that will serve to offset that mix shift i just described so how those puts and takes play out in is uncertain but our current estimate is they will fairly well offset each other jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks and then i guess just for my followup looking at the expenses guide its a pretty wide range and you had talked about being able to be flexible there i guess with the backdrop that there are some increases in fixed expenses like you said with healthcare and cost of living and fdic what are those levers where can we see expense growth moderate if the overall growth isnt there synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp when you look at our expense outlook first i kind of want to step back and kind of give components of it we have core operating expense increases so you can think about things like merit and just normal inflationary pressures and thirdparty spend things like that thats about to of our nie increase yearoveryear when you look at our growth initiatives some of the larger ones are cib and maast thats about to of our nie increase yearoveryear and then we have the environmental costs like the fdic increase that are about of the increase yearover year so that kind of gives you a breakdown of where the expense increases are coming from but to your question around where is the flexibility the first place i would point is on variable compensation so in a scenario where revenues are lower it is likely that variable compensation will also be lower and thats automatic it happens naturally and thats about of our expense base second in a slower environment we have the ability to spend at a slower pace on some of our growth initiatives and then third we have the largest expense categories and so thats personnel thats thirdparty spend and thats real estate and so as youve seen with us in the past through the synovus forward initiatives we can always go back and assess opportunities in those areas to reduce expenses jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks operator thank you our next question comes from the line of brad milsaps of piper sandler your line is now open please go ahead brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp good morning brad andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning brad brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co thanks for taking my questions jamie im just kind of curious on the to extend the funding conversation how much can the bond book sort of help you out to the extent youd like to do that in case deposit growth does fall short of your kind of loan growth targets just want to think about whether you plan to shrink that or kind of what the outlook might be synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp our outlook right now for the securities book is for relative stability but kevin mentioned that we have over billion in contingent liquidity available to us and that includes the unencumbered securities in the securities portfolio so if i were to shrink the portfolio by million and get the cash from shrinking it or if i was to repo securities at i could get the million that way so its a liquidity neutral portfolio just given the quality of the securities that we invest in so when we think about that the liquidity is there as it is and so our management of that book is a liquidity play its also an asset sensitivity play because investing in those securities is fairly similar to receiving fixed except for you get a nominal spread and so thats philosophically how we think about it and we expect as i said relative stability in that portfolio as we go through brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co got it thank you and as my followup you mentioned in your comments opportunities around fixedrate asset repricing i think in the deck of the loan book is fixed are there any larger pieces coming up that reprice can you kind of give us a sense of what you might pick up and to the extent does the swap book sort of offset any fixed asset repricing this year just kind of wanted to get a sense of kind of where you think the opportunity is there in terms of kind of fixed rate asset repricing this year andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah when you look at the fixed rate assets on the portfolio we have securities portfolio billion book value at just over yield the prepayments on that are slow maybe around million a month and so thatll be kind of a little bit of a tailwind but not as material i mean the jump in the fourth quarter was pretty strong and we wouldnt expect to see increases like that as we go forward our residential mortgage portfolio a similar duration as our securities portfolio around billion and you look at that yield in the mid so as that pays off that will definitely be accretive and then we have kind of other fixed rate assets that are approaching or right at billion and those are there are opportunities for increases there those are not as a material as far as increases as the other fixed rate assets as the mortgages the hedge portfolio is a meaningful tailwind and so you can see in the appendix when we put the hedge maturities in there you can see that in the second quarter we have a billion maturing and you can see the jump up in the remaining hedge yield after those maturities those maturities in the second quarter will be about basis points accretive to the margin going forward just the second quarter billion and so we will see a tailwind from that that benefit will happen in the third quarter and beyond not in the second quarter so but thats how we think about those fixed rates and we do believe that the opportunity is pretty material as we go through and have maturities and payoffs and paydowns brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co great thank you synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 operator thank you our next question comes from the line of kevin fitzsimmons of da davidson your line is now open please go ahead kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson co hey good morning guys kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp good morning kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson co i just was hoping to touch on the revenues i believe you mentioned in the outlook while you dont have the separate item for in the outlook i believe you mentioned in the revenue growth section that you expected to grow at midsingledigit pace i just wanted to check that thats correct and what kind of baseline thats off and then it seems like i recognized that the valuation adjustments were probably not expected but it seems like even adjusting indiscernible at the low end of the range as communicated just in early december so just wondering was it mortgage or were there other items that were a surprise to you how low they were kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp so kevin ill start with the fee income guidance so yeah midsingledigits is embedded in the revenue forecast off of a base of roughly million and what that is we expect to see core client fees continue to grow whether thats on the treasury and payments solutions side whether its on the card side whether its on private wealth where weve continued to see growth those are the areas that weve been investing and thats where we actually saw growth in the headwinds obviously on mortgage although we dont see mortgage rebounding from a production standpoint you wont see the yearoveryear drag that you saw in so overall we feel very comfortable in that mid single digit fee income growth level and then ill turn it over to jamie for the second part of that andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp on the valuation those are things that we analyze from timetotime and run scenarios on these deals and so theres two different deals that impacted us in the fourth quarter the first was a new market tax credit deal and basically what happened there is when we ran the math that thats something that you basically reduce the valuation of the asset as you take the tax credits and the tax credits came through and we reduced the value of the assets so thats why you see a lower etr in the fourth quarter as well as an offset the other was a solar deal that as we looked at the forward benefits of that deal they were reduced and its still a positive irr it still helps us achieve our esg objectives but it is a reduced irr and so thats why there is a valuation adjustment on that kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson co synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 okay great very helpful and just we talked about the balance sheet already but i just wanted to make sure i understand so the loantodeposit ratio is just a little below here so given that the intent is to not necessarily utilize wholesale borrowings much but to fund loan growth with deposit growth for the most part would you that ratio to migrate up only modestly over like whats your comfort level with taking that ratio andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp that is our assumption for is for it to increase moderately and again i think that the philosophy around liquidity management is similar to the answer that kevin gave on loan growth these all move in tandem and we will be monitoring loan growth in the context of core deposit growth as we proceed through the year but were very comfortable with where we are and there may be times where we choose to use broker deposits to fund growth there may be times where we choose to use home loan bank or other sources to fund loan growth but the loan to deposit ratio to us is more of an output but yes in our base case we do expect it to increase moderately kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson co great thanks very much thank you andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thank you kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp thank you kevin operator thank you our next question comes from christopher marinac of janney montgomery scott your line is now open please go ahead christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey thanks good morning just a quick question about from bob and you mentioned of stress testing earlier does that lead to better pricing on new cre loans that you have this year and does that contribute to some of the revenue upside robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp yeah thanks chris for the question yes i would say the answer is it does from as jamie mentioned in his remarks i mean we think weve got some pricing discipline in the market weve got opportunity for spread enhancement when we do deploy capital in the loan account so i feel pretty good about that on the stress test that was more of a credit quality exercise versus a pricing exercise but nonetheless as we do deploy capital we particularly in cre weve got a little bit of got the ability to increase spreads slightly synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp and chris ill put an exclamation point on that to bobs point you know as we look at things like cre construction what were doing as an organization is were increasing the minimum requirements from a profitability standpoint to be able to do those and its not so much to your point its not a risk decision but its more of a profitability discussion and to put some evidence behind our ability to generate incremental spread when you look at the second half of and compared to the first half we saw about basis points of incremental yield over index for all of our commercial loans and so i think for a when you look at risk rating for a better credit production level were getting much wider spreads and thats something that will continue to do given the higher cost of funding going forward christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great thank you both for that thats helpful just a quick followup about operating leverage i know the guide has it positive beyond does some of the expense growth that you have this year create flexibility in four years just to have less expense growth and then maybe perhaps an easier time to get into ongoing positive operating leverage kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp yeah absolutely chris and ill let jamie ill jump in here quick on this one so well probably fight over who answers it so when you just look at jamie talked about the to of incremental expense increase this year for just new initiatives over time those new initiatives are starting to put off revenue youll see revenue growth in for things like maast cib analytics new treasury and payment solutions the exponential growth in revenue will be much greater than what youll see in expense in out year so youll see that sort of scurve with many of these new initiatives and you wont see the same level of increase yearover year from some of those new initiatives so we believe that and could be even better from an operating leverage standpoint just based on those new initiatives christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great kevin thank you very much operator thank you this concludes our questionandanswer session i would now like to turn the conference back
