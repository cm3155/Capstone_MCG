and now kevin blair will provide an overview of the quarter kevin s blair chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp thank you jennifer good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for our third quarter earnings call over the past three months synovus has taken several actions to better position the bank for a more challenging higher for longer interest rate environment while continuing to build and expand our diversified business model in order to deliver longterm sustainable growth as previously announced we completed two loan sale transactions during the third quarter which strengthened the balance sheet and freed up capital for the bank to make more profitable relationshiporiented loans the proceeds from the third party indirect auto and medical office building loan sales allowed us to reduce our level of wholesale funding while accelerating the path to our greater than cet1 target also on september we further simplified our business mix by selling our asset management firm globalt to its management team the divestiture will be immaterial to earnings and allow the bank to reallocate capital to higherreturning fee income lines of business while continuing to meet our wealth clients needs we believe globalt has a bright future as an independent investment advisor enabled to explore a wide range of additional partners and potential client relationships to that end we are in discussions to continue and expand our longstanding held for sale partnership with greensky given our ongoing discussions any potential revenue benefits are not currently included in our guidance there will be more details forthcoming over the next two to three months we are navigating the short term headwinds presented by the higher interest rates by making the tough decisions around the business mix synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 balance sheet optimization and operating expenses all of which will generate better financial performance in the quarters and years to come now lets move to slide for the quarterly financial highlights synovus reported third quarter diluted eps of and an adjusted eps of there were yearoveryear and linked quarter revenue and ppnr headwinds as a result of the continued higher deposit costs leading to further but more moderate net interest margin contraction as expected loan growth outside the medical office building sale was less than in the third quarter this core loan growth was primarily attributable to multifamily construction draws while the middle market commercial corporate and investment banking and specialty lines activity contributed to ci loan growth there continues to be an increased emphasis on stronger returns and more deposit relationshipbased lending which has translated into higher yields on new production core deposits increased or million from the second quarter importantly the shift from consumer money market accounts to higher rate time deposits slowed during the third quarter noninterest bearing deposits declined less than in the first and second quarter but clients continued to use their excess operating and personal funds net interest margin contraction was not as significant as expected due to modestly better asset yields and funding costs also our deposit generation strategies are demonstrating continued success as production remained strong with third quarter levels approximately higher compared to the same period in given the pressures on the margin our operating expense discipline was quite evident as adjusted noninterest expense increased from the second quarter and rose just from the prior year cost containment remains a very high priority in fact we expect adjusted noninterest expense should be relatively flat yearoveryear in as we implement more cost reduction initiatives in a variety of areas as expected credit cost increased as we continue to move off historically low levels however excluding the third quarter loan sales net chargeoffs remained manageable at basis points which includes a basis point impact from a commercial industrial credit discussed in our recent 8k filing along with other banks in the syndicate we are in the process of evaluating and assessing all avenues of recovery to include legal recourse related to that specific transaction finally we continue to focus on maintaining a strong capital position as we navigate through a more volatile economic environment and with our cet1 position ending the quarter at we are now slightly above our targeted capital levels over the nearterm we expect to continue to preserve capital in excess of our target levels given the continued amount of economic uncertainty now ill turn it over to jamie to cover the third quarter results in greater detail jamie andrew jamie gregory jr executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thank you kevin as you can see on slide total loan balances ended the third quarter at billion reflecting a sequential decline of million or this includes the impact of the sale of the billion medical office loan portfolio similar to recent quarters cre growth was a function of draws related to existing multifamily commitments and low levels of payoffs on the ci side middle market commercial lending and corporate investment banking contributed to growth our new loan fundings remain focused on customers with more broad based deposit and fee income relationships at the same time we are rationalizing growth in credit only lending areas that have a lower return profile or dont meet our strategic relationship objectives our balance sheet optimization efforts should continue over the near synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 term and loan and core deposit growth should be relatively balanced no further meaningful loan portfolio sales are being contemplated over the foreseeable future turning to slide core deposit balances grew million or sequentially during the third quarter driven by a increase in time deposits which was partially offset by a decline in noninterest bearing deposits importantly we leveraged our improved liquidity position to reduce wholesale funding by billion which improved our wholesale funding ratio by basis points while public funds declined million or the noninterest bearing deposit decline is a byproduct of deployment of excess funds and continued pressures from the higher rate environment this is a slower decline than we experienced during the first quarter and second quarter there was also a moderation in the decline in money market accounts during the quarter as the shift from money market accounts to cds slowed we expect to experience some core deposit growth during the remainder of the year supporting this growth are the seasonal tailwinds along with our targeted deposit gathering efforts as we look to deposit rates our average cost of deposits increased basis points in the third quarter to which was a slower rate of increase than in the second quarter and equates to a cycle to date total deposit beta of through the third quarter from the month of june to the month of september total deposit costs were up basis points our deposit costs and betas were impacted by the pricing lags on core interest bearing deposits as well as the decline in the noninterest bearing deposits our expectations for the through the cycle total deposit betas are now slightly reduced to to at year end now moving to slides and net interest income was million in the third quarter down versus a year ago and a decline of from the second quarter which is slightly better than our previously disclosed expectations nim compression moderated during the third quarter down basis points from the prior quarter versus basis point sequential decline in the second quarter the asset side of our balance sheet continued to benefit from higher rates though higher deposit pricing and further remixing within our nib deposit portfolio offset those gains as we look forward we expect the fourth quarter nim to decline in a similar amount as the third quarter followed by a relatively stable margin in the first quarter that is expected to be followed by expansion as fixed rate asset repricing is more than enough to overcome the gradually reducing headwinds of deposit repricing and negative deposit mix shift the graph on slide outlines the estimated marginal benefit to our nim relative to our nim in the third quarter of attributable to fixed rate repricing for the asset and liability categories listed there this assumes rates remain constant with the september levels at a fed funds and around on the 10year slide shows total reported noninterest revenue of million adjusted noninterest revenue was million down million from the previous quarter and up million yearoveryear the variance in quarteronquarter fee income was due to a combination of factors there was a change to the nsfod program in july which impacted noninterest income by approximately million and is now almost fully reflected in fee income as of quarter end core fee income has also been impacted by a soft mortgage lending market and more muted capital markets activity however the relative stability of fee income over time highlights the diversity of our revenue streams many of which are insulated from the impacts of the volatile rate environment we continue to invest in core noninterest revenue streams that deepen client relationships such as treasury and payment solutions capital markets and wealth management which have demonstrated healthy growth over the past few years we also continue to synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 simplify and optimize our business mix during the third quarter the sale of asset management firm globalt to its management team on september led to a million nonrecurring gain during the third quarter and should result in approximately million per year reduction in the fee income and million reduction in the non interest expense moving to expenses slide highlights our operating cost discipline reported noninterest expense was million adjusted noninterest expense of million was up million or from the prior quarter and million from the previous year representing a increase personnel expenses were flat sequentially benefited by our head count reductions during the second and third quarters reported noninterest expenses were impacted by an million voluntary early retirement charge and the million loss from the loan sales during the quarter a million special fdic assessment should be incurred in the fourth quarter importantly we will remain quite proactive with disciplined expense management in this revenuechallenged environment we implemented reductions in a voluntary early retirement program in the second and third quarters which supported a nearly companywide reduction in the head count in addition and as kevin mentioned we have several expense rationalization initiatives in various areas underway which should keep our adjusted noninterest expenses relatively flat yearoveryear in there will be more underlying details of these initiatives discussed at forthcoming industry conferences during the fourth quarter moving to slides and on the credit quality as expected credit losses have risen over the past two quarters primarily from idiosyncratic chargeoffs the basis point increase and million growth in our allowance for credit losses primarily reflects loan migration trends and an uncertain economic environment excluding the medical office building loan sale net chargeoffs were basis points compared to our to basis points guidance for the second half of this year approximately of third quarter chargeoffs excluding the medical office building loan sale were attributable to a previously disclosed shared national ci credit totaling million nonperforming loans increased modestly to as credit metrics migrate from historically low levels total criticized and classified credits rose slightly but are still a manageable of total loans we expect net charge offs to average loans to be to basis points in the fourth quarter we continue to have a high degree of confidence in the strength and quality of our loan portfolio we will continue to apply our conservative underwriting practices and advance marketing analytics to new loan originations and portfolio monitoring and management as seen on slide our capital position continue to increase in the third quarter with the common equity tier ratio reaching and with total riskbased capital now at retained earnings and strategic transactions supported basis points of capital accretion in third quarter in addition the proceeds from the third quarter third party indirect auto and medical office building loan sales allowed us to reduce our level of wholesale funding and total commercial real estate exposure even though synovus have achieved its greater than cet1 target we will continue to preserve our capital over the nearterm given theres still a fair amount of macroeconomic uncertainty moreover there should be more limited capital accretion in the fourth quarter as a result of the expected million fdic special assessment of course we will regularly reassess the economic environment and consider if any opportunistic capital management may be appropriate in the future ill now turn it back to kevin to discuss our guidance kevin s blair chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 thank you jamie ill now continue with our updated fundamental guidance for the remainder of loan growth is still expected to be to for the year we expect fourth quarter loan production to be at similar levels to third quarter which remains muted versus growth in the current quarter should be fueled by continued success in middle market and corporate and investment banking as well as draws on construction lines we maintain our expectations for core deposit growth of to as the company strives to balance loan and core deposit growth and will be aided by the previously mentioned seasonal tailwinds and new funding growth initiatives the revenue growth outlook for is to which assumes a fed funds rate of that holds through the end of the year deposit betas are now expected to reach to by yearend versus in the third quarter we have lowered our adjusted expense growth expectations to approximately to in versus previous expectations of to please note that the noninterest expense guidance does not reflect the impact of the upcoming million fdic special assessment expected to be incurred in the fourth quarter while the environment has resulted in strategic shifts in priorities we remain confident in our growth strategies and we continue to remain diligent in expense management over the course of the year we have reduced our guidance range as we have implemented various expense initiatives moving to capital we are now at our target cet1 level at this time we think it is prudent to maintain that target and continue to build capital over the nearterm given theres still a fair amount of uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment we still anticipate the tax rate should approximate in supported by recent federal tax investments at synovus we are focused on execution and closing out in a strong fashion we remain optimistic that through the actions we have taken we are better positioned to overcome the shortterm headwinds and to strengthen the banks foundation for return to growth as we proceed through and now operator lets open the call for a qa synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions the first question we have comes from ebrahim poonawala of bank of america ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc maybe a question kevin on the credit quality so i appreciate that theres a no hit from one credit in the third quarter but just looking at the criticized loans and the im not sure if thats impacted by that or not but just talk to us around your sense of where credit is headed youve spent a decade talking about just the cleanup that has happened in the castle and then under you on the credit quality side postgfc so give us a sense of one where you think credit is headed from a macro perspective over the next months and then within your loan book where are you seeing stress like what should we expect from the outside in terms of potential lumpiness in credit cost over the coming quarters thank you kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp so ebrahim theres a lot of questions in that one question but let me take it from the start and ill let bob add in some comments around credit but weve been talking for some time about normalization and moderation of credit cost and that comes off as you know some of the lowest levels of credit cost and metrics that weve seen in many many years and what youre seeing this quarter was weve talked a lot about and publicly disclosed is one large credit that charged off which was a syndicated credit and even with that credit were still within the guidance that we provided during the second quarter where we noted basis points to basis points in the second half of the year so although credit is moderating we believe that its still very manageable its within the ranges that we had anticipated and ill be honest with you that large transaction the loss content in that was not fully considered when we gave that guidance so that tells you that in general our credit cost came in a little less than what we would have anticipated so its manageable we still believe that the second half of the year will be basis points to basis points excluding the loan sales yes theres been some increases in npls and criticized and classified but i think that comes with the territory as you see in this environment many of our clients are having their margins compressed by the recessionary and inflationary efforts that are or numbers that are happening and that results in things being downgraded but again its all within a manageable range and when you look at it for the full year we still think were going to come in between that basis points and basis points so for all the discussions that were talking about net chargeoffs theres really just a modest increase over what weve seen in previous years synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 and bob what would you add to that robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp yeah ebrahim hi its bob i wouldnt add much other than to say we just its just general normalization particularly in our corporate businesses that recall that we have about of our balance sheet is made up of wholesale corporate businesses and for years those numbers were extremely low so as they move back into sort of normal territory as it relates to credit cost it kind of pushes your number in that basis points to basis points range as kevin said i think thats a reasonable expectation for us and overall stress is in some of these portfolios but nothing that we dont feel like is manageable ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc noted and i guess maybe one for you jamie around give us a sense of deposit pricing as we move into next year just competitively what are you seeing in the market are things getting easier or are they as competitive as they were earlier in the summer and maybe if you can talk to just the asset side of the balance sheet around potential offsets with some of the fixed rate low assets repricing thank you andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp ebrahim i think youre the champion of multiple questions in one let me make sure i hope ill answer them on this but ill start with deposit production and what are we seeing there if you look at the rate of deposits the going on production quarteronquarter we were up basis points quarteronquarter right around million was the cost of deposit production in third quarter and whats included in that is a little more than basis points increase in the cost of cd production so thats around but the rate pressure on cds has been a little bit reduced recently in the month of september so we feel good about that and then on other interest bearing deposits we saw in maa production come down about basis points quarteronquarter we saw the now production down almost approximately basis points quarteron quarter so we feel good about the trends of deposit production within our interestbearing products mix will be a impact there going forward so all in i would say the deposit production cost increases in the fourth quarter will probably be similar to what we saw in the third quarter but for overall deposit costs we gave our guidance of to throughthecycle beta so we expect continued increases in the fourth quarter and that actually has a little bit less to do with the production than it has to do with repricing in the existing book and i would point to the table we put on page of the earnings deck with the fixed rate repricing what you see below the line there is the impact of the cd repricing in the fourth quarter it has a decentsized impact of cd maturities so we have a little more than billion in cds that mature in the fourth quarter the rate on those today is about and so we will have a headwind to deposit costs in the fourth quarter as those reprice kind of the normal going on production rate we do expect further declines in noninterestbearing deposits in the fourth quarter and so we think that the net result of all of that is you get to that to throughthecycle beta for the month of december and deposit costs in the year in the mid to upper2 synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 and you asked about the asset side of the balance sheet will you remind me was that the rate on the asset side ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc yeah i was just wondering in terms of the churn the repricing that were going to see and the magnitude of that next year whether that could be indiscernible growth andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah so as we look at looking forward next year so well have a few things happen first going back to the liability side we think that deposit cost total deposit costs will peak in or flat line starting in early but then you start to see the benefit of the fixed rate asset repricing and you can see that on that same chart with the fixed rate assets and you see how that impact just grows as you go through the year so we expect the margin to decline in the fourth quarter be relatively stable in the first quarter and then because the impact of cd repricing is a couple million dollars incrementally each quarter when you go through that will be easily overwhelmed by the benefits of the fixed rate commercial loan repricing securities portfolio hedge runoff and residential mortgage repricing and you can see that in the chart that its pretty powerful as you go through as a nice tailwind to both nii and the margin ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thank you so much bye operator thank you we now have steven alexopoulos you may proceed with your question when youre ready steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everybody kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc so i want to start on the ability to generate positive operating leverage in on the expense side kevin you said you planned to hold adjusted expenses pretty flat in so hoping first you give a little color on that and then i also want to talk about the revenue opportunity and at this juncture do you see as an opportunity to show very modest operating leverage do you think it could be more substantial we will start there synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp yeah steve let me take this off as we look longer term well first ill speak to our communications strategy for the fourth quarter so in the next six weeks well be out with a couple of different presentations and we have today where were speaking to the third quarter and the fourth quarter and then well be presenting it at baab or give more of a strategic update and including some of the details of our expense initiatives and then we have the goldman sachs conference in early december where we will give more details of our financial outlook longer term but when you look at where we are right now on expenses so in the very nearterm we expect expenses to be down in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter we had a range of million to million on adjusted expenses and then as we said we expect adjusted expenses to be relatively stable in of course were excluding the fdic onetime assessment that we expect to come in the fourth quarter we have a lot of different initiatives behind that flat expense guidance and really whats exciting to us is a lot of it just improves how we gotomarket and embedded in that expense outlook is still spending for growth to grow our core client base so what youll see from us is youll see in our businesses that drive core relationship growth youll still see spending to grow and so thats embedded in our strategy and well speak more to that in a couple of weeks up in boston and so we feel good about that outlook but when you think about positive operating leverage for the calendar year its challenging because the first half of had such strong revenue growth that the exit run rate on revenue is just simply lower than it was at the entry to but when you look at quarterly increases and it goes back to ebrahims question just a minute ago the nii tailwinds because of fixed rate repricing and where yields are today is very powerful and so while we may not have positive operating leverage for calendar year if youre comparing quarteronquarter yearoveryear it gets pretty powerful as you go through calendar year the issue is simply just looking at calendar year versus calendar year steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it thats helpful and then maybe just one other one so on the noninterest bearing deposits are down fairly sharply again peers are seeing the pace of outflows to be fairly materially how close are you to seeing a bottom and when you talk about your expectation for nim to stabilize in and then expand whats the underlying assumption of where noninterest bearing deposits are thanks kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp our outlook for nib to total remains the same as we said in july and so we expect to end the year around noninterest bearing to total deposits and embedded in that would be a decline in the fourth quarter somewhere around million in nib deposits we do believe that that rate of decline will slow significantly as we look out into and again well give more details on the longerterm outlook in early december but we do believe that that will slow and thats due to both environmental impacts as well as strategic impacts with our businesses that were continuing to grow like treasury and payment solutions steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay perfect thanks for taking my questions synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp thanks operator your next question comes from michael rose from raymond james you may proceed michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning guys thanks for taking my questions maybe just a broader stepback question for you kevin obviously a lot has happened since the investor day earlier last year can you just give us an update on some of your initiatives whether it be maast or the commercial real estate initiative and just broadly where you think you stand in some of those efforts and kind of maybe some of the areas that might require some additional kind of investment from you obviously the targets that you laid out back then i think are going to be tough to achieve in this interest rate environment but just wanted to get a sense for where you think you are and what the opportunities are as we move forward thanks kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp yeah michael its a great question and i think part of the answer is that with this sort of environment where youre seeing margin contraction youre seeing questions around credit it kind of masks some of the success that weve had in some of the underlying initiatives and thats not just with our new initiatives it also stands to talk about some of our core businesses that continue to see improvements in productivity deepening the wallet share things like that but as it relates to our targets i would just tell you as weve said in the past when we did that forecast for our threeyear top quartile performance obviously we did it under a different interest rate environment our goal is to continue to focus on generating top quartile performance and those numbers may be different but relatively speaking outperforming that of our competitors but when it gets into some of the initiatives something like a maast when we talk about our banking as a service platform one of the things that we set out from the beginning was we wanted to prove a hypothesis that this was a solution that would be wellreceived by independent software vendors and partners as i said on the last call i think were proving that hypothesis pretty clearly in that weve already on boarded nine isvs and payment partners onto the platform today the spend of the payment facilitation portion of that is approaching million and we have additional partners in the pipeline evaluating the software and going through the contractual phase those partners would represent about billion in payment volume so it shows that theres a great deal of interest in the maast solution the second part of that objective was ensuring that we had the right type of products to be able to fully offer the capabilities that the end users would desire today we have payment facilitation and a banking suite of products that include checking and a debit card but we just announced this week we signed a strategic partnership with fintainium which will provide additional apar capabilities to the end user so as we entered this we had just a minimum viable product were expanding that into additional solutions the third leg of the stool is we have to assess whether the utilization and the adoption by the end users will generate a great deal of revenue and thats the part of this equation that its still too early to tell but based on the demand that we have from the software providers we remain very optimistic as to the viability of this solution and were actually expanding it into a bankingonly solution where some folks actually dont need the payment facilitation they just want the banking services and thats about of the pipeline we have today synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 i think its also important to note were not betting the bank on this initiative weve spent about million in expenses yeartodate and so its a measured investment for us cib corporate and investment banking we have about ftes were up to clients that weve been able to onboard we have almost million in outstandings and million in revenue yeartodate from a capital market standpoint so that is progressing we continue to get traction and thats just going to take time to continue to build but it is exceeding our expectations from a pl impact at this point again weve spent about million yeartodate so were not betting the farm on any one of these initiatives its really the combination of many and the third one ill just mention is analytics we talked a lot about analytics and the importance at providing proactive advice to our clients both on the commercial and consumer side were fully up and operational with our consumer platform and yeartodate we booked about million in incremental revenue just from some of the leads and insights that that solution has provided us and thats just starting to scratch the surface so some of the big initiatives that we rolled out in february in investor day are ahead of schedule again small numbers in the grand scheme of things but as i said then ill say again today its really not about the pl impact today its about the impact two and three years down the road where its going to create new sources of revenue that we havent had and let me just im answering this longwinded but let me add in one new one and i referenced this in the prepared remarks but were currently in discussions with greensky and the private equity firms that are acquiring the greensky platform from goldman our discussions around a sponsorship program that would allow us to continue to support their origination and distribution of production with a balance sheet light liquidity neutral solution and as a reminder i know you know this michael weve been in business with greensky on a held for sale arrangement since that continued with goldman after the acquisition but it was only on a small portion of their originations which this quarter created only about million in revenue the new program that were contemplating is not built into our guidance and would have a much broader program across all of the production and well be very excited about sharing specifics about that banking as a service program and the financial benefits in the coming months michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc kevin thats a great color and maybe just kind of following up to that jamie i understand that the positive operating leverage is going to be pretty challenged next year but just given this forthcoming arrangement with greensky i think third party loans are down to about of the total should we expect a higher level of balance sheet growth as we think about the next year obviously to given this quarters production seems a little bit light it seems like you have some momentum i just wanted to get a sense i know its early if we could expect a more robust balance sheet growth as we move into next year thanks andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah michael as we look further out and again well give a more detailed outlook here in about six weeks but as we look further out we do expect balanced loan and deposit growth and what youll see there is youll see that our core client businesses will continue to grow and our objectives there to grow faster than the market we believe that we have a right to win we believe we can take share and so thats our objective in our core client businesses but you may see some other businesses that remain flat or even decline on the margin that are non core and noncore multiproduct clients and so youll see a little bit of a mix there over the next few quarters as we go forward synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc great thanks for taking my questions kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp thank you michael operator we now have brady gailey from kbw you may proceed brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey thanks good morning guys kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning brady brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc so you have a common equity tier of over now and as i think about the future its probably not going to be a lot of growth youre still making good money so that ratio is still going to creep higher and the stock is sitting here barely on top of tangible book value so do you think that sometime in it makes sense to consider reengaging in the share repurchase program andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp brady first as youre well aware weve been in capital accumulation mode now for about six quarters and weve achieved those objectives that we raised a while back to get above to your point so now we are in capital management mode so our priority in that is just what its always been in the past is deploying that capital to clients but beyond that we will manage our capital ratios as appropriate including the use of share repurchases and right now we believe two things are important for that discussion first in the fourth quarter if you assume that we have that fdic fee we do not expect to accrete a lot of capital in the fourth quarter second we believe theres still a lot of economic uncertainty so where we are right now were going to sit on the sideline likely here in the fourth quarter but in well be balanced like youve seen with us in the past weve been in capital management mode prioritizing clients and then secondarily youd likely see us with share repurchases brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right thats helpful and then my second question is just on the path of the nim like i understand its down a little bit more in and then stable and then youre starting to see some expansion especially in the back half of the year if i look at that slide where you suggest basis points of nim expansion i know thats only looking at synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 like the fixed rate piece of it so is there any way to look at the entire company and gauge what the possible nim expansion could be after we reach this bottom andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp well let me for todays purposes lets go through what is not on that fixed rate chart and so first what that does not include would be any mix shifts in deposits between the noninterest bearing and the interest bearing or even within the products that are within interest bearing it doesnt include the headwind of deposit production costs and as i mentioned production for us was around in the third quarter which is clearly higher than our total deposit costs it would not include any deposit product rate increases and so all of our guidance is a flat rate forward look and so were not really expecting any material product rate increases but if they were to happen it would not include that and then it also doesnt include the impact of the loan spreads and i want to point to something there because the loan spreads have been a really good story for us weve had six consecutive quarters where the floating rate loan spreads to index have widened and so we believe that were getting paid for the risk were putting on the balance sheet we believe its accretive to capital and so thats a good trend there so those four things are not included in that now because the first three were negative so i mean its likely that those are a little bit more headwinds they are tailwinds to what you see on the fixed rate repricing but the trend should have a similar shape is what you see on that chart brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right thats helpful thanks jamie operator we now have christopher marinac of janney montgomery scott christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc thanks and good morning i had a question for bob on the kind of the combined snc portfolio and club and purchase business where do you want that to go as next year comes into focus its more about kind of where do you think that will land in the future robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp yeah hi chris thanks for the question right now were at around of our total loans is our snc book and thats what would be defined as sort of the official snc definition we also have another or a little over billion in what i would call sort of club syndicated deals more of a regional level so you kind of take those two together were sitting around of that being sort of true sncs of that number were agenting around million of that so for what thats worth we think thats good fee business for us et cetera i think were comfortable in this range in terms of percentage and relative to concentration limits we kind of like that to range were sort of there i think thats our expectation is we kind of manage the business going forward weve been in this space a long time obviously it can bite you occasionally as you saw but nonetheless we think weve got a really good group of bankers running that business very focused on opportunities that that book can present us and there are some and we feel like well just be more strategic there synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 but in terms of balances i think were kind of where we need to be and well stay in that range as we look ahead if not slightly declined but certainly in that range christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great thats helpful thank you for that and then kevin just a quick question about sort of dda flows for maast are you seeing any of those now or is that still going to be kind of fourth quarter in kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp were starting to see some deposit flows theyre still immaterial at this point because with the million payment transactions that i referenced that money moves pretty quickly so the deposit story and the revenue that will come with it will make about million in revenue in maast this year so its still in the infancy stage chris christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great but a year from now we can probably talk more definitively about progress there just to think about kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp yeah yeah i think as you see the payment facilitation business pick up and i think its important to note with that business weve been intentional about slowly onboarding clients thats why we talk about only having nine on the platform and 40plus in the waiting room just because we want to make sure that we get the product right and to your point once we start onboarding some of these new relationships we talked about getting a billion to billion in deposits just from the payment facilitation business and if we expand it into the banking only side theres obviously a lot more in deposits that are at play there as well christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great thank you very much for all the information about today and last night too kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp yeah thank you operator thank you we now have brandon king of truist securities please go ahead when youre ready brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey good morning kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning brandon synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 brandon king q analyst truist securities inc so jamie i want to take another angle at the expectation for nim expansion in the back half of next year and you already laid out your assumptions but could you just know how youre thinking about kind of what you think the biggest risk is to that potentially being pushed out or maybe not being realized according to your current expectations andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp i think the biggest risk when you think about the margin out there well i would say versus fed policy and so if you have big moves on either side of fed policy with their balance sheet if they were to draw down the rrp significantly and take a lot of liquidity out of the system i think that could be challenging for the banking industry but then also if they were to start easing in the second half of next year the same lag that benefited the industry on the way up would be a headwind and so if youre just simply looking at the margin at the end of next year if you assume that the fed starts easing in the second half or the third quarter of next year then that will be a headwind now i would argue its a temporary headwind because of the lag and as weve said before we believe that our sensitivity to the frontend of the curve in an easing cycle was relatively flat so we would not expect that in itself to contract the margin but the lag would definitely be impactful whenever that happens so that policy is a risk and then i would say just general deposit mix shifts are a risk and were pleased with the trend of the slowing decline in nib in the third quarter we expect the decline to slow again in the fourth quarter and then slow again into but thats i would point to those as some of the risks to that outlook brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay very helpful and then a follow up to your commentary on the loan spreads and how does it impact the loan growth profile of the bank you also mentioned that you expect to grow faster than the market and you would think i guess with the higher loan spread maybe that would slow down the growth theoretically but could you just help us square away those items kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp well brandon ill take that i think those two are not necessarily correlated in that what were doing today in the marketplace is were just being more selective at where we want to lend capital and that allows us with the competition pulling back a little bit it allows us to pull up our pricing and as jamie mentioned when you look at the variable rate spread over index were up basis points yearoveryear when we look into the future and a lot of the loan growth will be based on where demand goes we talked a lot about production was off about this quarter over last quarter pipelines are relatively flat right now the economic impact to demand will determine kind of how fast we grow loans and as jamie mentioned earlier we will also want to correlate that back to the similar level of growth well see on deposits but what were optimistic about is our ability to continue to grow ci loans through our cib organization through middle market and through some of our specialty areas maybe the one question mark and wild card for will be what happens with the payoff pay down activity in cre as you know we havent seen a very constructive marketplace there given where cap rates and interest synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 rates have moved and so we havent had a lot of payoffs and pay downs so our production next year in cre it may be hard to keep up with some of the payoff and pay downs that have delayed through this cycle but were just as bullish on the areas that we can grow and as you noted our goal is to continue to exceed the rate of growth of the underlying economy brandon king q analyst truist securities inc that is very helpful color thanks for taking my questions kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp thank you operator thank you we now have kevin fitzsimmons of da davidson your line is open kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst d a davidson co hey good morning everyone just a quick question on the bond portfolio some banks have pulled the trigger on restructuring is that something that is on the table or would you focus more on just doing what youve been doing using the cash flows to help fund loan growth or perhaps pay down wholesale bonds thanks andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp kevin as we look at the bond portfolio we would consider restructuring i dont think it would be incredibly significant i mean you think about the capital that we have that we call excess capital of being at theres limitations to how we would use that capital and how much we would use on something like a bond restructuring but i think similar to what youve heard from others in the industry if theres a restructuring that makes sense and you get a 2year payback a 25year payback or something like that it could be something that we entertain but at this point today we dont have any intention to do that but its something that we do look at from time to time kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst d a davidson co okay great thanks and one quick follow up on the sale on that globalt i think you mentioned that about streamlining your i forgot the exact wording you used but about streamlining and so im just wondering if you can add a little more color on was it competing with some other the banks more larger wealth management platform or what was it about it that made you want to streamline with that sale thanks kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp yeah kevin i think we said simplification of our business model and its really its a money management firm that weve owned for some time and so it didnt really compete it actually served as an investment vehicle for our financial advisors to place money they largely do etf funds and as you know in that sort of business well continue to use them and partner with them as we look to move our clients assets under management into the best products for optimizing their returns but its a high efficiency business and we believe that we can take the operating expense from that and put it back into either the frontend of the wealth origination so the financial synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 advisors or the private wealth advisors or we can put it in other businesses and earn more from an efficiency standpoint so its really about taking operating expenses and redeploying those into businesses that have higher returns kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst d a davidson co great makes perfect sense thank you thanks kevin thanks jamie operator well have the next question from timur braziler of wells fargo timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning i wanted to kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc circle back i wanted to circle back to your commentary about nii and nim in an easing fed cycle i appreciate the color on a lagging deposit base im just wondering given the fixed rate repricing schedule versus variable rate loans that would go down a little bit more quickly is that an offsetting element or could we actually see some nim compression over the first couple of quarters following a slight easing kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp in that scenario it depends on the timing i would have to think through but i mean you think about the immediacy of loan repricing we have a little more than of our loans are floating rate that would repriced immediately and then the deposits would lag in it so about of our deposits would also reprice immediately i mean theyre you could think of them as index based even if theyre not all directly indexed based it would likely lead to a decline in the margin for those periods for those early fed ease time periods now that being said this fixed rate repricing this chart doesnt just it wouldnt just end in the fourth quarter like we displayed here that continues for multiple years because you think about those exposures especially when you look at residential mortgages you look at the securities portfolio we continue to benefit incrementally way beyond this and so this time period so this benefit will overcome that headwind of that lag headwind when the fed does start to ease thatll be a temporary issue and so we have a longterm benefit from fixed rate repricing and at some point if you do assume the feds next move as an ease there will be a headwind for a couple quarters timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay that makes sense and then just looking at the timing of some of the loan sales and other ppnr activities over the last couple of quarters maybe just talk through the cadence on nii over the next quarter or two does synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 that cadence follow margin or is there something within the timing of recent sales that maybe we see nii performance a little bit better than what the expected margin performance would be at least in the next quarter andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp it will trend along with the margin so youll see a decline in the fourth quarter and then flat in the first quarter and then youll see nii growing with the combination of loan growth as well as margin expansion as you go through timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks for the color operator we now have brody preston of ubs brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning everyone kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning brody brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc jamie i think ive got it but i just wanted to put a finer a point on the guidance with the revenues the guide kind of implies that we step down a bit more than i would have expected in the fourth quarter just with the nim commentary and some of the fees is there something that im missing because i think it implies like about a million stepdown in operating revenues andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp so brody i think that what youre looking at there is really in fee revenue and so we had fee revenue of million in the third quarter and that included million of globalt revenue so when you adjust for that our fee revenue in the third quarter was around million to million and so looking forward to the fourth quarter there will be an incremental headwind in nir on the retail side because of the deposit fees but we expect to overcome that headwind and we expect to be flat to slightly up from the million to million in the fourth quarter and then on the nii as we mentioned we expect the margin to decline in a similar amount as what you saw in the third quarter but then you also have the impact the full quarter impact of the sale of the medical office portfolio brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay and just to clarify on the revenue component jamie i think if i was reading the slide correctly that the expectation around the beta is like more of like a spot in december kind of expectation for the beta and not the average for the quarter correct synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thats correct its the month of december brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay cool can i just follow up on bobs well indiscernible next real quick bob did you happen to have what percent of that snc portfolio you guys are the lead underwriter on robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp yeah brody on the snc portfolio its about million so of that billion were the agent on about million brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay thank you for that and then i did just have a couple of last quick ones bob do you happen to have the acl on the office portfolio robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp yeah we dont ill let jamie follow up with you brody but from a allowance perspective we dont disclose by asset class just generally speaking our cre allowance in the range in general but then within that obviously the asset classes are broken down but our office portfolio today where criticized and classified is less than npls are so in the context of the size of that portfolio its relatively stable now were not we obviously see we have a watchlist there weve been working that weve talked about that before but right now the performance is relatively stable and the allocation just follows the cre allocation andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp and brody one thing about that portfolio is as bob mentioned weve seen no new net negative migration in the office portfolio in the third quarter it continues to perform and the watchlist remains the same as we discussed in july and before and so that portfolio continues to kind of perform as we expected when you think about the allowance in the categories any sort of migration obviously impacts the life of loan loss estimate for the portfolio but what we saw in the third quarter when we ran the allowance was the allowance to loan ratio within cre was relatively stable for the quarter where we saw the increases was in ci and small business and so we feel good about what we can see in front of us we believe it aligns with that to basis point chargeoff guide for the fourth quarter and well continue to give updates as we see more clear outlook brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it and then just one last one bob just on the senior housing portfolio you guys have built that into a pretty good business line for yourselves and i think if im remembering correctly its performed extremely well for you from a credit perspective versus some other banks that have maybe struggled a little bit just with that generic kind of category of senior housing could you maybe help us better understand the puts and takes around that synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 portfolio and why yours kind of outperforms relative to some other banks that also have a senior housing exposure robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp yeah sure brody thanks for the question just a couple of comments on it weve been in this business a long time we have a very experienced team that manages this book youre right its around billion we think about it today it is certainly feeling some stress and theres no question about that as it relates to increased labor cost certainly the interest rates staying higher here in the last six months or so continue to put some stress on it but the positives here are as an industry this industrys continuing to see increased occupancy rates most of our operators have implemented increased rental rates so the revenue top line improvement is there its just not its going to take some time for it to overcome the rapid increase in cost as it specifically relates to our credit performance in this portfolio were sitting today at a criticized classified ratio around that number to that number could drift a little higher but overall we put a couple of loans on a nonaccrual this quarter that was the increase in our nonaccrual rate to bps from bps but again that was within our expectation we think the loss content here in those few credits is very manageable very low and is certainly within our guidance so overall i think its just client selection longterm in this business brody and the way the portfolio is performing the way we underwrite again theres some stress but overall its performing within our expectations kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp and brody id just add that you know when you look at this asset class everybody assumes that all senior housing looks the same some more in memory care skilled nursing some are more private pay i think to bobs point client selection here dealing with longterm operators more private pay less skilled nursing has resulted in better overall performance so i think thats a big driver of that brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc awesome i appreciate the color guys thanks have a good day robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp sure kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp thank you operator we now have stephen scouten of piper sandler you may proceed with your question stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co hey guys thanks for the time i guess i wanted to think about maybe the lossgiven default rates around credit and kind of how you think about the different buckets i think with that snc credit a lot of people were surprised synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 just the ability for that to have such severity so im just kind of wondering how you think about that within the snc book and maybe within the other categories as you look at credit overall robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp yeah stephen ill make a couple of comments there obviously lossgiven default in that particular case was way outside of the norm we do consider that to be an idiosyncratic event obviously we spend a lot of time and have spent a lot of time dissecting that specific credit and going back and looking at our processes and procedures et cetera our conclusion from all of that work is that we still have good processes our underwriting was sound just a number of events that took place in that credit they quite frankly all went the wrong way and all happened over a period of time that just led to a very outsized and lossgiven default that would certainly not be normal for us from our perspective generally speaking we look at leverage loans we look at enterprise valuebased loans we underwrite those generally speaking to get inside of the assets the hard assets within a couple of years those are the kind of when you think about whilst given default on those loans thats where you risk is our general underwriting guideline is to get the cash into the pay the loan down as quickly as we can not rely on that enterprise value for any period of time generally we have third party valuations et cetera but to stay short with exposure to enterprise value leverage loans for us around billion we certainly manage it very closely and stay spot on with our reporting so thats a little bit of rambling stephen but does that help on how we look at those types of credits stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co yeah i think that helps but i mean i guess generally you dont really view that segment or maybe ci more broadly as having any terrible risk from a severity perspective at this point relative to this area is that fair to say robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp i think thats fair to say yes we certainly could ignore that business and not do it but weve chosen to do it over time we think selectively we can make good returns there and manage the credit risk appropriately kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp and i think i just add to bobs comment steve when you think about where theres a higher lossgiven default in ci generally if youre doing small business unsecured where we dont have a lot of exposure there and then when we think about our ci were doing investmentgrade credits and bobs point this credit that were referencing here is an anomaly we generally have primary sources of repayment secondary sources of repayment many of these loans are recourse and so when you think about lossgiven default in the ci business theyre generally low just based on the way that we underwrite those and when we talk about cre and were talking about having ltvs or ltcs similar scenario there where you feel like you have enough equity and cushions of protection that would keep the lossgiven defaults lower over there so i think it would be erroneous to assume that all sncs have much higher lossgiven defaults based on this one credit synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co great very helpful and then just my other question is you guys have talked about seeking out higher risk adjusted returns youve talked a bit about these spreads widening on floating rate credit as you pursue those endeavors where do you think that leaves you from a segment perspective to be more active as we move into kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp i missed that again steve what was that stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co yeah just kind of as you seek out higher risk adjusted returns where does that lead you segmentwise where do you think kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp yeah stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co much of that growth will come from as a result i guess where are those returns hiding if you will kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp no its a great question and it starts with if youre doing a loanonly relationship i would argue that its hard to say that youre getting great returns unless youre taking a lot of risk so were not suggesting that were suggesting that where were focus is on the businesses where we have the opportunity and the right to win by providing a full set of solutions not just the lending piece so were getting crosssell on the depository treasury side were getting personal relationships from the business owners and so where you see that our middle market commercial today were doing very very well with that our core commercial kind of our community commercial our small business areas and even in corporate and investment banking unit where were going to market and industry verticals were able to bring capital markets and additional fee income and treasury and deposits where it makes those returns much higher so we talked in the past that weve kind of double down in the commercial space thats where were winning market share but when you go to the consumer side were focused on the mass affluent and affluent segments where we believe that not only advice matters but we have a personal touch that allows us to get a greater share of wallet so thats where were focused its relationship banking so it doesnt sound real sexy but it comes down to delivery and how we do that and thats why we win things like jd power and greenwich because we do it really really well andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 and let me let me follow up on that jd power and greenwich because a lot of this has to do with how do we fund that growth and our success with our retail network our success with our commercial banking deposit production when you look at the third quarter deposit production were up about yearoveryear and then when you decompose that because clearly a lot of that comes from time deposits from cd production but even when you back that out and when you look at interest bearing nonmaturity deposit production so now an mma deposit production those together are up over yearoveryear so thats a positive production trend is sustained and then in the third quarter we see we saw a reduction in account diminishment so on the consumer side the diminishment we saw in the third quarter relative to the second quarter down almost on the commercial side the same thing down almost approximately and this has been the big headwind yeartodate so its good to see the pressure reducing on this stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co got it thats great color thanks a lot for the time guys kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp thank you steve operator thanks thank you stephen this concludes our questionandanswer session and i would like to turn the conference back over to mr kevin blair for any closing remarks thank you kevin s blair chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp thank you as we close out todays call i want to thank everyone for their attendance and their interest in synovus despite a more challenging operating environment synovus continues to demonstrate strength resilience and flexibility weve been proactive in executing on various initiatives to navigate the risks associated with the recent interest rate and economic environment through our completed balance sheet optimization and business simplification strategies weve freed up capital liquidity and operating expenses to pursue higher returning opportunities with rates expected to stay higher for longer fixed asset rate repricing should support a nim trough in the fourth quarter and create a path to expansion in the second half of somewhat masked by the margin contraction we are experiencing healthy steady growth in areas like cib middle market wealth management and treasury and payment solutions continued growth in our core businesses coupled with the traction on new sources of revenue we look forward to transitioning from a more defensive posture into one of growth most importantly we continue to believe that our strong underwriting monitoring and client selection as well as the actions taken through the years to generate diversification and an economically vibrant southeastern footprint will result in manageable levels of credit losses over this economic cycle lastly the company will continue to maintain a very strong liquidity and capital position to allow for flexibility and ongoing uncertainty thank you to our team members for your dedication and hard work each day synovus and our talented team members continue to be recognized nationally we were recently ranked 5th in bank directors magazine best us banks over billion in assets analysis i have a lot of optimism as certainty replaces uncertainty and we synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 control what we can control the outlook for nii is clearing up and we see a path to sustained repeatable balance sheet and revenue growth but i want to conclude todays session with a message of hope hope for resolution healing and peace in the middle east this situation is deeply concerning for many reasons including the effect it has in the lives of many across our region many of who are close friends and valued clients my thoughts and prayers are firmly with our jewish community and others who are in peril and in my hope i hope to see signs of resolution and that will lead to true healing and longterm peace with that operator that
