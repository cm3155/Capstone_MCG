wells fargo  company q1 fraud is flourishing on zelle banks say its not their issue csuite strategies management top standout banks for innovation overall financial services dont score particularly well but fraudisflourishingonzellebankssayitsnottheirissue fraud is flourishing on zelle banks say its not their issue justin faunce lost to a scammer impersonating a wells fargo official in january and hoped that the bank would reimburse him mr faunce was a longtime wells fargo customer and had immediately reported the scam involving zelle the popular money transfer app but wells fargo said the transaction wasnt fraudulent because mr faunce had authorized it even though he had been tricked into transferring the money mr faunce was shocked it was clearly fraud he said this wasnt my fault so why isnt the bank doing the right thing here consumers love payment apps like zelle because theyre free fast and convenient created in by americas largest banks to enable instant digital money transfers zelle comes embedded in banking apps and is now by far the countrys most widely used money transfer service last year people sent billion through zelle compared with billion through venmo its closest rival zelles immediacy has also made it a favorite of fraudsters other types of bank transfers or transactions involving payment cards typically take at least a day to clear but once crooks scare or trick victims into handing over money via zelle they can siphon away thousands of dollars in seconds theres no way for customers and in many cases the banks themselves to retrieve the money nearly million americans were defrauded through scams involving digital wallets and persontoperson payment apps in according to javelin strategy research an industry consultant organized crime is rampant said john buzzard javelins lead fraud analyst a couple years ago we were just starting to talk about it on apps like zelle and venmo mr buzzard said now its common and everywhere the banks are aware of the widespread fraud on zelle when mr faunce called wells fargo to report the crime the customer service representative told him a lot of people are getting scammed on zelle this way getting ripped off for was actually really good mr faunce said the rep told him because many people were getting hit for thousands of dollars wells fargo later sent him a note saying it did not consider his loss to be a fraudulent one its not clear who is legally liable for such losses banks say that returning money to defrauded customers is not their responsibility since the federal law covering electronic transfers known in the industry as regulation e requires them to cover only unauthorized transactions and the fairly common scam that mr faunce fell prey to tricks people into making the transfers themselves victims say because they were duped into sending the money the transaction is unauthorized regulatory guidance has so far been murky when swindled customers already upset to find themselves on the hook search for other means of redress many are enraged to find out that zelle is owned and operated by banks its like the banks have colluded with the sleazebags on the street to be able to steal said bruce barth another victim in late mr barth was hospitalized with covid19 and his phone disappeared from his hospital room a thief got access to his digital wallet and ran up charges on his credit card took out cash at an atm and used zelle to make three transfers totaling all three accounts were at bank of america where mr barth has been a customer for more than years when he filed fraud reports the bank quickly refunded his cash and credit card losses but it denied his claims for the zelle thefts saying the transactions were validated by authentication codes sent to a phone that had been previously used for that account bank of america was essentially saying that the zelle transactions were authorized even if his phone was stolen mr barth was livid i filed grievances with every agency i could get my hands on locally and nationally he said every response i got was useless after the new york times contacted bank of america about mr barths case it refunded him bill halldin a bank spokesman said the decision was based on new information provided in late february the zelle network is operated by early warning services a company created and owned by seven banks bank of america capital one jpmorgan chase pnc truist us bank and wells fargo early warning based in scottsdale ariz manages the systems technical infrastructure but the banks and credit unions that use zelle can customize the app and add their own security settings peter tapling a former executive at early warning who is now a payments consultant said banks havent done enough to educate customers about the risks of zelle he suggested that customers treat zelle as they would cash dont hit the button to send this money unless you would hand this person and walk away because the moment you send it its gone he said its hard to tell exactly how much fraud takes place through zelle because banks arent required to publicly report their losses banks say they take fraud seriously and are constantly making adjustments to improve security but police reports and dispatches from industry analysts make it clear that the network has become a preferred tool for grifters like romance scammers cryptocurrency con artists and those who prowl social media sites advertising concert tickets and purebred puppies only to disappear with buyers cash after they pay the consumer financial protection bureau issued detailed guidance to banks last year about what kinds of fraudulent losses theyre required to repay the regulator requires banks to reimburse customers for losses on transfers that were initiated by a person other than the consumer without actual authority to initiate the transfer including those who obtain a victims device through fraud or robbery that guidance set off alarm bells among banks said deborah baxley a partner at paygility advisors a consulting firm that specializes in the payments market until then the banks point of view was pretty much sorry customer its on you she said still the consumer agency doesnt address who is responsible for a fraudulently induced transfer if the customer physically hit the buttons the cfpb is aware of the problem and considering how best to address it said tia elbaum an agency spokeswoman the scheme that ensnared mr faunce some bankers call it the metome scam has become so common that its a staple of local news reports and police blotters the consumer bureau has been barraged with complaints in pennsylvania a surge in reports about the scam prompted the police to issue a warning the precise mechanics vary but it is typically a psychological con that involves tricking victims into surrendering sensitive information in mr faunces case it started with a text message that appeared to come from wells fargos fraud department asking him to verify whether he had made a payment through zelle moments after he texted back no his phone rang the caller id flagged the number as wells fargo the man on the line identified himself as a wells fargo employee and told mr faunce that a thief was trying to empty his bank account using zelle to stop the transactions the man said mr faunce would need to send the money back to himself behind the scenes the thief had linked his account which was also at wells fargo to mr faunces phone number to use zelle customers must link either their email address or their phone number to their zelle account mr faunce did not have his zelle account linked to his phone number that allowed the scammer to claim mr faunces number and attach it to his own zelle account then the thief instructed mr faunce to send to his phone number assuring him that it would route the money right back into his own account instead mr faunce ended up sending money to the thiefs wells fargo account the thief was able to sidestep the banks twofactor authentication process by asking mr faunce to read out the verification codes that wells fargo sent to his phone it was only when the caller told him to repeat the procedure and send another this time from his savings account that mr faunce got suspicious he didnt have that much in the second account a genuine bank representative would have known that another wells fargo customer julia gibson lost to a similar scam in october after she reported the fraud to the bank it gave her a provisional credit for the lost cash but in january the bank abruptly rescinded the credit sending her balance to zero and incurring overdraft fees the bank had decided the loss wasnt fraudulent what was so frustrating about this whole thing was that the customer service rep i talked to told me so many people had been experiencing this ms gibson said in their appeals to wells fargo mr faunce and ms gibson cited the consumer bureaus rules about fraudulent losses but the bank repeatedly rebuffed them there are certain indicators that we look for in the investigation to let us know that there has indeed been fraud on the account wells fargo wrote to mr faunce on feb during the investigation we were not able to find any of those indicators present and denied the claim after the times contacted the bank it refunded ms gibson we are committed to following all regulations governing transactions said jim seitz a bank spokesman we are actively working to raise awareness of common scams to help prevent these heartbreaking incidents he declined to discuss specific customer cases other victims of fraud trying to recoup their money from banks have had better luck when citing the law ken pageromer a psychotherapist and author who lives in long beach ny had taken from his account in november after he received spoofed text alerts and calls that appeared to come from citigroup phone numbers the bank initially denied his claims at the urging of his husband gregory a financial adviser mr pageromer wrote the bank a letter citing regulation e and sent copies to the police and banking regulators citi soon returned his stolen money we encourage customers to be alert to suspicious messages that appear to come from citibank said drew benson a spokesman for citi if a customer does receive such a message we urge them not to respond click on links open attachments or sign on to their account from a link they should immediately delete the message and contact us justin faunce who lost to a scammer impersonating a wells fargo

csuitestrategiesmanagementtop250standoutbanksforinnovationoverallfinancialservicesdontscoreparticularlywellbut csuite strategies management top standout banks for innovation overall financial services dont score particularly well but there are pockets of excellence in former federal reserve chairman paul volcker quipped that the most important financial innovation that i have seen the past years is the automatic teller machine while that may have been good for a laugh in part because it had a ring of truth it isnt the case any longer several banks and consumerfinance companies led by wells fargo co and capital one financial corp more than hold their own in innovation as gauged by the drucker institutes measure of corporate effectiveness in fact their innovation scores put them in the top among all firms that we tracked in ahead of chip maker nvidia corp pharmaceutical giant eli lilly co and wireless company verizon communications inc this showing reflects how innovation among big banks and certain other financialservices companies has been rocketing over the past decade says ed white chief analyst and vice president of intellectual property and innovation research at clarivate which provides data on patent and trademark activity for our statistical model our framework which rests on the teachings of the late management scholar peter drucker serves as the basis of the management top an annual ranking produced in partnership with the wall street journal the list was published in december in all we examined those large publicly traded firms last year through the lens of indicators in five categories customer satisfaction employee engagement and development innovation social responsibility and financial strength to create our ranking companies are compared in each of the five areas in addition to their overall effectiveness defined by mr drucker as doing the right things well through standardized scores with a typical range of to and a mean of in the innovation category we adjust our model slightly to look at every companys performance relative to its industry peers this way we arent comparing apples to lululemons on rd expenditures or any of our other innovation indicators but for our latest research we wanted to remove that constraint and see how the companies in the financial sector stack up against all of the companies we cover in absolute not relative terms as a whole the sector is weak with an average innovation score of this puts it eighth out of broad industry groups a result of some segments such as thrifts and reinsurance companies that are quite a bit below average but there are pockets of excellence wells fargo led the pack in with an absolute innovation score of the biggest driver of this number was the extremely high rate at which the bank abandoned prior patent applications a metric that gives insight into whether a company has a culture of letting go what isnt working and focusing on whats next wells fargo also had a high rate of new patent applications last year this combination of shedding the old and embracing the new comes as the company is moving beyond older technologies such as mobile wallet where you can digitally store
