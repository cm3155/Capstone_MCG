goldman sachs group inc the q4 goldman sachs group inc has scaled back plans to provide banking services for the masses on its own at least for years apple inc has been asking big us banks to allow their customers to view depositaccount balances on its digital wallet according to people familiar with the matter the banks largely have declined the people said wary of ceding the customer experience to apple and becoming simply the financial plumbing behind the scenes but goldman has been happy to oblige a relative newcomer in consumer banking the wall street giant has expanded and extended a partnership with apple that began a few years ago with a credit card goldman is working on a highyield savings account for apple cardholders it is also going to provide some of the backend services that will allow apple to offer buy now pay later plans the partnership reflects goldmans revamped approach to consumer banking a business it launched a few years ago to great fanfare that has yet to turn a profit the bank has abandoned plans to build a fullservice consumer bank in favor of providing banking services to wealthmanagement customers and through partnerships with companies such as apple banks and technology companies have been in a heated race for years to build a financial super app one that offers banking payment and investing services facebook now known as meta platforms inc tried and failed to build a futuristic cryptocurrency network google last year abandoned a plan to pitch checking accounts to users of its digital wallet theres absolutely an opportunity to reshape how people interact with financial institutions said bob odonnell president at technalysis research a marketresearch firm everything is done on the phone so why wouldnt the financial management piece also happen on the phone apple piggybacking off its ultrapopular iphone and apple pay service is trying to pull ahead of the pack the idea is to build a technology ecosystem that satisfies peoples many daily financial needs all in one place its driving loyalty and engagement with the iphone and maybe the ipad its about the apple ecosystem said ron shevlin chief research officer at cornerstone advisors a banking and fintech advisory firm but apple cant do much without the cooperation of banks like goldman in october the companies unveiled plans for the highyield savings account where apple card customers would be able to deposit funds and earn interest on their cashback rewards the account will be separate from goldmans own highyield savings account known as marcus apple also sees big potential in buy now pay later plans whose popularity has soared in recent years apple will connect to merchants through the mastercard inc network goldman will serve as the sponsor essentially issuing a card number that merchants will receive when consumers pay using the service the arrangement is in keeping with goldmans broader plans to expand into payments the bank has sought to position itself as a technology player behind the scenes according to people familiar with the matter rather than a brand in its own right that is just what apple was looking for when it sought a bank partner for its creditcard program a few years ago the tech giant wanted more control over certain aspects of the program than many issuers were willing to give people familiar with the matter said for example people apply for the card through apple the application isnt available on goldmans website though the bank is responsible for evaluating potential borrowers apples insistence on controlling the customer experience has turned off other banks apple pay for example is the default taptopay option for the iphone that has prevented banks from launching or growing their own payment wallets jpmorgan chase co shut down its chase pay service last year in part because of the iphone limitations people familiar with the matter said capital one financial corp too has pulled plans for its own wallet in part because of apple pay the people said a recent proposed classaction lawsuit brought by several credit unions accused apple of violating antitrust law in restricting access to technology that could be used to enable other wallets on apple devices banks also have been trying to keep apple pay from becoming a bigger player in payments including with the recent rollout of taptopay debit and credit cards that compete directly with the service the decision to introduce the technology was partly spurred by a desire to make it as easy to use cards in stores as it is to use apple pay according to people familiar with the matter some of the same banks that rushed to work with apple pay when it first rolled out in now regret that decision the wall street journal previously reported because of the fees they pay on card purchases made using the wallet it is finally a good time to be a stock picker about of actively managed largecap mutual funds are on

winners and losers in the stock market investors have bailed out of big tech stocks and instead snapped up shares of energy companies and other defensive stocks that stand to fare better in a downturn those shares however have a much smaller influence on the direction of the broader market with technology displaced from the markets leaderboard the percentage of stocks outperforming the sp as of monday was the highest in roughly two decades according to dow jones market data that has opened a window for stock pickers many of whom have still suffered losses even if they squeaked past their

going to work anymore said justin burgin head of equity research at ameriprise financial mr burgin said investors have to find attractive stocks instead of just buying and holding an index fund the sp has fallen in and is on pace for its worst year since an equalweighted version of the index that gives the same status to both the smallest and largest companies is down a more modest the outlook for next year remains murky as well although inflation has begun to cool federal reserve chair jerome powell reiterated last week that the central bank isnt done lifting rates and said he expects them to rise higher next year than previously forecast higher rates have sapped the appeal of tech and other growth stocks because they lower the future value of their projected earnings apple shares have

companies and longduration growth stocks that can power through a recessionary environment some of the markets biggest winners in include exxon mobil corp up gas and power company pge corp up and

strategist at raymond james investment management you were able to just buy apple or amazon or tesla inc and you know your riskadjusted returns were great because the stocks only moved in one direction despite their change in fortunes this year many investors are hesitant to turn their back on technology mr burgin from ameriprise said he wouldnt bet against microsoft and apple because of the ubiquity of their products his firm for example uses microsoft teams and other microsoft products and he said he doesnt expect that to change i know a lot of people that would skip their rent
