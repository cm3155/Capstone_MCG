americans are missing out on billions of dollars in interest by keeping their savings at the biggest us banks the federal reserve has raised interest rates to their highest level since early just before a near failure of the financial system plunged the american economy into recession yet the biggest commercial banks are still paying peanuts to savers in theory savers could have earned billion more in interest in the third quarter if they moved their money out of the five largest us banks by deposits to the five highestyield savings accounts none of which are offered by the big banks according to a wall street journal analysis of sp global market intelligence data the reality is complicated the five banks collectively made far less than billion in profit in the third quarter and if savers were to move their money en masse banks offering highyield accounts could lower their rates the five banks bank of america corp citigroup inc jpmorgan chase co us bancorp and wells fargo co paid an average of interest on consumer deposits in savings and moneymarket accounts during the quarter according to sp global the five highestyielding savings accounts paid an average of during the same period according to data from bankratecom the five banks collectively hold about half of all the money kept at us commercial banks in savings and moneymarket accounts tracked by the federal deposit insurance corp that share has held steady despite the availability of higher rates elsewhere the billion gap in the third quarter was the largest amount since recordkeeping began but will likely be dwarfed in the fourth quarter because top highyield savings accounts have raised their interest rates to more than since the start of americans have lost out on at least billion in interest by keeping their savings in the five biggest banks that total balloons to billion when going back to when the fdic started tracking consumer deposits in moneymarket and other savings accounts and us savers have likely missed out on much more than billion because the average rate the five biggest banks have paid over the past eight years includes higheryielding moneymarket accounts and some business accounts traditional savings accounts paid an average rate of at the five largest banks during that period the fdic doesnt separate traditional savings and moneymarket deposits in its recordkeeping why havent savers moved more of their money opening a new bank account is time consuming said gary zimmerman chief executive of maxmyinterest a company that specializes in moving customers deposits between the nations highestyielding savings accounts some customers arent aware of how much money they could make by switching he said and others just dont care people dont think critically about financial decisions mr zimmerman said big banks also serve a lot of depositors with small accounts who may not see the value in making the switch a depositor with in a typical bigbank savings account would have earned just more for the year by switching to one of the top highyield savings accounts people also are willing to pay for convenience and simplicity said nathan stovall a principal analyst for financial sector data at sp global market intelligence banks refer to customers who shop around for higher savings rates as hot money mr stovall said they have invested billions of dollars into developing userfriendly technology and consumerbanking services but that is still a fraction of what they would have to pay in interest were they to raise rates instead if you can retain customers without having to pay for them thats the name of the game mr stovall said you want to attract as many lowcost stable customers as possible alicia gillum has been with bank of america for years and said she has no interest in searching for a new bank even though her savings of more than is earning almost no interest her loyalty has earned her platinum honors tier status which

diego recently began moving his money into a highyield savings account at lendingclub a longtime investor with multiple retirement accounts rental properties and a healthy brokerage account with schwab he still holds most of his in savings at chase where he earns interest im old fashioned i like to be able to see my money mr kvendru said with brickandmortar banks you have that feeling that its not going anywhere americans flush with stimulus payments and enhanced unemployment checks flooded us banks with deposits earlier in the pandemic the biggest banks got an outsize share of those deposits about billion flowed into moneymarket and savings accounts at us commercial banks between the first quarter of and the third quarter of according to the fdic more than of that went to the five largest banks but things could be changing the average rate on moneymarket and savings accounts at the five largest banks nearly tripled in the third quarter from where it was in the second in an october report mr stovall wrote that he expected large banks to increase their savings rates more quickly through the end of and increase even further in as the fed continues to raise us interest rates and banks compete more aggressively for customers jpmorgans record contrasts with that of bank of america corp which made large loans for buyers of twitter citrix nielsen and others bank of
