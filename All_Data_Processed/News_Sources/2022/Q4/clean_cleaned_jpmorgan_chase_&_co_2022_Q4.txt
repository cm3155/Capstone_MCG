jpmorgan chase  co q4 a lawsuit says the bank helped conceal the exploitation of women and girls by the convicted sex offender jeffrey epstein the attorney general of the us virgin islands is accusing jpmorgan chase of helping jeffrey epstein illegally exploit women and girls according to a lawsuit filed tuesday in federal court in manhattan the suit says jpmorgan provided banking services to mr epstein after he had been convicted of sex charges and failed to report his suspicious activities the lawsuit said the bank should have known about mr epsteins illegal activities at a villa on little st james island an island he owned in the territory and should have reported them to the authorities as part of its adherence to antimoneylaundering laws jpmorgan knowingly negligently and unlawfully provided and pulled the levers through which recruiters and victims were paid and was indispensable to the operation and concealment of the epstein trafficking enterprise the lawsuit said a jpmorgan spokeswoman declined to comment mr epstein a secretive financier maintained close associations with a long list of wealthy men politicians and celebrities even after he pleaded guilty in to two counts of soliciting prostitution from a teenage girl and faced allegations in that he had helped smother a larger investigation into his activities he died in an apparent suicide in august while in federal custody on a new set of sex exploitation charges mr epstein was a client of jpmorgans highend banking services for years a relationship that continued well after his conviction even though the banks employees raised alarms about the legal and reputational risks the bank ejected him as a client in tuesdays lawsuit parts of which were redacted from public view said the banks failure to cut ties with mr epstein after his conviction as well as its failure to scrutinize his activities when new sexual abuse allegations against him became public amounted to helping mr epstein carry out his schemes the lawsuit cited civil racketeering claims that the territorys attorney general denise n george filed in against mr epsteins estate the case described a complex operation focused on bringing women and girls to little st james island where they were abused and then paid to stay silent on nov ms george and the estate announced an agreement to settle the case for around million including million in repayments to the government for tax benefits that mr epstein inappropriately obtained and about half the proceeds from the sale of mr epsteins island which could total million neither the estate nor its executors admitted wrongdoing as part of the settlement this weeks lawsuit against jpmorgan seeks to force the bank to turn over profits from its business with mr epstein and his companies and to pay unspecified amounts in penalties and damages to the government jpmorgan facilitated and concealed wire and cash transactions that raised suspicion of and were in fact part of a criminal enterprise whose currency was the sexual servitude of dozens of women and girls in and beyond the virgin islands the lawsuit said houston jpmorgan chase co is launching a national program to try to get more loans into the hands of minority smallbusinesses owners and close a persistent racial gap in financing the countrys biggest bank has been quietly piloting a specialpurpose credit program this year here and in dallas detroit and miami that allows it to offer more loans to business owners who might have otherwise been rejected jpmorgan isnt changing its lending rules based on race instead it is targeting minoritymajority neighborhoods across the country with loans and business mentoring all customers who apply in those areas will benefit from the changes other banks have been working on similar projects and pilots but jpmorgans is the first with national reach the bank says the lending and a program starting next year on credit cards will help the bank open new accounts over five years chief executive jamie dimon said the bank put a focus on smallbusiness lending when looking at its broader commitment to spend billion on racial equity because of feedback from communities one of the biggest things we heard was go help our minority small businesses he said in small businesses owned by people of color were more likely to apply for financing than whiteowned firms but were about half as likely to get all the funding they requested according to a federal reserve survey even minority applicants with good credit scores were less likely to get financing the jpmorgan chase institute the banks inhouse think tank found that of businesses in majorityblack hispanic and latino communities had less than two weeks of cash on hand compared with a third of businesses in white areas in dr tennille johnson a pharmacist and admitted fashionista grew tired of her scrubs she and two partners decided to launch a side business scrubs to the rescue

staff the 45yearold says she needs to fund her growth with ideas such as scrub subscriptions we want to innovate she said banks seek to strike a balance in creating specialpurpose lending programs they dont want to make loans that are bad for the bank or the customer they have struggled to change the credit criteria including credit scores cash flows and business history that make it more likely minority applicants are rejected the office of the comptroller of the currency has been urging banks to try to solve the issue as part of that program citigroup inc this summer started a pilot program to lend to minority smallbusinesses in los angeles by changing rules concerning credit scores and requirements around how a business operates sometimes in investment banking it is the deals you dont do jpmorgan chase co has avoided most of 2022s socalled hung deals that have cost competitors billions of dollars in paper losses whether by luck or by design the biggest us bank didnt make loans backing takeovers of companies such as twitter inc citrix systems inc and nielsen holdings plc which fell in value as markets turned choppy jpmorgans record contrasts with that of bank of america corp which made large loans for buyers of twitter citrix nielsen and others bank of america chief executive brian moynihan has consistently sounded an optimistic note about the us economy clashing with jpmorgan head jamie dimons gloomier warnings there is one thing mr dimon feels good about his firms low exposure to bad buyout loans which bankers call leveraged loans there are no real leveraged loan writedowns this quarter and that market isnt yet cleared mr dimon said on an october conference call with wall street analysts our share of it is very small so were very comfortable competitors attribute jpmorgans absence as a lender on big deals in to a diminished relationship with privateequity firms in recent years the bank also served as an adviser on some of the mergers like nielsen which prevented it from providing loans they said jpmorgan ranks fourth among us arrangers of buyout bonds and loans this year while bank of america is third according to data from dealogic jpmorgans average rank over the past years is seventh compared with its average of third place during the prior decade jpmorgan also is grappling with the fallout from some relatively recent buyout financing that went sour such as loans it made backing the purchase of sports betting company william hill international still it has far fewer hung deals on its balance sheet than competitors leaving it with more cash to win new business privateequity firms corporations and individuals that acquire companies often pay in part with loans made by investment banks to the businesses they buy the banks aim to unload the debt to fund managers for more money than they lent out pocketing the difference buyout loans account for only a small portion of total lending in the us and funding them doesnt necessarily mean that a bank has an unusual risk exposure still the strategy backfired this year for firms such as bank of america barclays plc goldman sachs group inc and morgan stanley which committed in the winter and early spring to bankroll large takeovers interest rates subsequently rose turning debt investors cautious and sending the price of leveraged loans tumbling now the banks must choose between liquidating the loans at a loss or keeping them on their balance sheets at markeddown prices jpmorgans global head of corporate debt kevin foley was a midlevel banker during the credit crisis when the bank was swamped with deals gone wrong jpmorgan was lead lender on jc flowers cos billion takeover of student loan lender sallie mae which eventually was canceled and cerberus capital management lps troubled purchase of car maker chrysler mr foley switched from making loans to restructuring them tussling with other creditors often hedge funds to recover as much money as possible from companies in bankruptcy court he worked on some of the most contentious workouts of the era including automotive supplier lear corp and newspaper publisher tribune media co
