card number that merchants will receive when consumers pay using the service we look forward to continuing to grow our work together through another innovative product that helps consumers lead healthy financial lives and are excited about this latest expansion of our relationship a goldman spokesman said when goldman sachs the investment bank known for its hardcharging culture recently told its senior bankers that they could take off as much time as they wanted the policy shift immediately catapulted it into the ranks of americas most employeefriendly companies managers should take the vacation they need so they can continue to run hard be competitive run productively but take care of their families david m solomon goldmans chief executive told cnbc but the banks move hasnt led to much cheering at a place where employees build their careers on being available to clients any time anywhere goldman in particular has long prided itself on that ethos so much so that its leaders rarely use all their holidays and often forgo outofoffice messages some have even been known to take satellite phones on vacation some observers have been downright cynical about goldmans motives calling the policy a costsaving move in the past if employees had a fixed number of vacation days that they didnt use the bank had to pay them for those unused days when they quit but unlimited vacation means the bank doesnt have to pay them anything goldman sachs which recorded a record profit of billion last year said any cost savings were incidental our focus is on incentivizing our people to take more time off rest and recharge said bentley de beyer the banks global head of human capital management we are proud to join with many other companies in introducing a flexible policy that requires a minimum amount of time out of the office to continue to build resiliency and sustained performance at goldman the new policy has chafed bankers partly because mr solomon has been adamant about a return to the office managing directors and partners at goldman are typically allotted vacation days or more depending on the length of their tenure said a company representative who requested anonymity to discuss personnel matters under the new policy more than senior bankers will no longer have a cap on their time off although all employees will be expected to take a minimum of days a year beginning in according to a memo viewed by the new york times the 15day stipulation is to provide some structure to junior employees who will also get two extra days off to make sure the changes stick the firm will keep tabs on vacation days taken and address the matter if needed during performance discussions the representative said in recent years goldman has rolled out family leave benefits it gave days off for covid19 disruptions which about employees used in it extended parental leave to weeks from weeks goldmans vacation benefits echo those offered by other financial firms including blackrock a giant asset manager and bridgewater the worlds largest hedge fund goldman sachs group inc the wall street firm synonymous with long hours and a hardcharging culture is telling some senior executives it wont be capping their days off goldman said partners and managing directors will no longer have a set number of vacation days starting this month the company is also expecting all employees to take a minimum of three weeks away from work each year for goldman the decision marks the latest in a string of moves it has made to adjust to the banking trading and deals environment since goldman was one of the more aggressive banks about returning to inperson work and had largely full offices in january meanwhile its business has been booming firms like goldman have raced to bring workers back into the office and hire new ones to keep up with the flood of deals and frenzied markets banks have more recently paid more to keep these workers goldman paid an additional billion in compensation in jpmorgan chase co and citigroup inc each spent billions more in compensation as well in november goldman announced paid leave for pregnancy loss an expansion to the amount of time employees can take for bereavement leave and the introduction of an unpaid sabbatical for longtime employees goldman said its decision was designed to further support rest and recharge for workers as a firm we are committed to providing our people with differentiated benefits and offerings to support wellbeing and resilience goldman said in the email announcing the new paidtimeoff policy which was earlier reported by bloomberg news goldman has about partners and thousands of managing directors it has more than total employees companies are facing more stringent environmental social and governance requirements leading into proxy season the wall street journals emily glazer talked to catherine winner global head of stewardship at goldman sachs asset management about the secs new proposed rules goldmans proxy voting changes and advice for companies in their sustainability reporting edited excerpts of the interview follow wsj what was your reaction after these longawaited rules came out ms winner our voting framework is very supportive of the secs proposed climaterisk disclosure rules both the sec and the tcfd task force on climaterelated financial disclosures are pushing for greater emissions disclosures grounded in materiality in the us particularly our policy will support progress on emissions reporting as we get closer to the proposed implementation deadline for the secs rule as one of the leading global asset managers we have trillion in assets under supervision we will use this to help us drive positive change on this topic wsj when the proposals came out were you surprised or did you have a sense of what goldman sachs asset management would do ms winner we really believe that climate risk is a material investment consideration weve been engaging with companies for a number of years around disclosure and the encouraging of disclosure around greenhousegas emissions that are material to their business weve been engaging with companies since we engaged to encourage better disclosure and of those companies that we engaged have made improvements to their disclosures since we believe this is a material investment consideration and boards should be held accountable for these climate risks and for disclosure of climaterelated data and reporting we intend to vote against chairs of the committees with oversight of esg risks at those companies that are still not disclosing or that have made zero improvements on the disclosure of emissions data david solomon is getting a bigger slice of goldman sachs group incs privateequity profit the goldman sachs chief executive and a tight circle of lieutenants are taking a cut of profits from the firms private investment funds according to people familiar with the plans the perk could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars over the next several years to those executives the people said multiples of their annual pay depending on how those funds do the perk risks angering both shareholders and the goldman fund managers out of whose pockets the money will come goldman executives and partners can only earn the carried interest if they also invest their own money in the funds a bank spokeswoman said in a statement with reasonable fund returns she said the executives couldnt earn multiples of their annual pay the banks board reviews the coinvestment program each year she said unique among banks goldman is a big player in private investing the firm has billion of its own money and that of clients invested in corporate buyouts loans real estate and stakes in other investment funds it is in the middle of another big fundraising push in the past the profits from those investments known in the industry as carried interest were split evenly between goldman and the executives actually managing the funds a common setup that ensures everyone has some skin in the game going forward those executives will receive just the people said ten percent will be shared with goldmans roughly partners part of a push to restore the prestige of a title that once guaranteed stratospheric wealth but has dimmed five percent will go into a pool for mr solomon and his closest deputies the people said fewer than a dozen people
