pnc financial will be a regional no more pnc nears billon bank deal pncfinancialwillbearegionalnomore heard on the street pnc financial will be a regional no more pnc financial services acquisition of the bbva franchise in the us would make its regional bank nametag increasingly obsolete the question is whether that also transforms its profitability the billion deal agreement flows from pncs sale of its stake in blackrock earlier this year which pulled in billion after tax by paying all cash pnc is in effect swapping out the blackrock stake which generated good returns but didnt add much strategically for a major expansion of its core business some investors may have been dreaming that a bank with billion to play with could radically rethink the whole concept of banking perhaps with a huge bet on tech but many big banks are still finding that core relationship banking and branches even in a scaledback form remain part of the playbook to grow truly profitable customers that may be particularly so in commercial banking where pnc will be tilted after the deal instead investors should think about what pnc is aiming to redefine which is the regional bank appellation by adding bbva in places like texas the sun belt and california to pncs eastern center of gravity postdeal the bank would be in of the top us metropolitan statistical areas up from so even if it is a different kind of bank far more main street than wall street it is more national in footprint than citigroup for example along some dimensions it may also be more national than some peers in asset size among regionals such as us bank or truist that have regional branch gaps on the east coast or west coast respectively given the government scrutiny of every bank deal there is further logic to such an expansion for a bank like pnc already well above a key threshold of billion in assets its ultimate capital ratio requirements typically depend more on its mix of business than its size if pnc had added say an investment bank with a big trading desk it might have ended up facing more stringent capital requirements due to its complexity or riskiness than it would by adding a large amount of the same type of banking in more regions pnc is betting that the best way to add returns at a time of historically low rates is to bet on applying its operational knowhow including cost reduction and an improved technology backbone it estimates that it can generate a internal rate of return on the deal which is likely better than banks are typically getting on just deploying their capital in lending these days pnc estimates about accretion to its earningspershare by investors may want to keep an eye on return on equity too pnc projects a postdeal return on common equity of in that is about what analysts are projecting for this year at according to visible alpha and shy of last year at over but it is still much more than analysts were forecasting for which is under so at a time when returns to risk from lending money are low the returns to taking business risk are relatively better that may not be radical but if wellexecuted it could still be lucrative pncnears11billonbankdeal pnc nears billon bank deal pnc financial services group inc is in talks to buy the us arm of spains bbva for more than billion according to people familiar with the matter in one of the largest bank tieups since the financial crisis a deal would create the fifthlargest us retail bank with more than billion in assets a giant in an industry that has been slow to consolidate it could be announced as soon as monday the people said acquiring bbvas us operations would bolster pittsburghbased pncs presence in fastgrowing markets in the southeast and west bbva which in bought alabamabased compass bancshares has about billion of assets in the us with branches across the sunbelt including a major presence in texas pnc is strongest in the midatlantic midwest and southeast pnc chief executive bill demchak said in september that extending the banks national presence would be the first second and third objective of any deal big without being deemed too big to grow and with a strong record on takeovers pnc has long been seen as a likely consolidator of the fragmented us regional banking sector it stoked that chatter this year when it sold its stake in blackrock inc for billion bringing in cash that could be redeployed into an acquisition big bank mergers have been rare since the crisis with few major players willing to test the political waters and wary of new regulations now applied to larger banks what is more the old logic of adding adjacent branch networks is less powerful as digitally savvy consumers are less tethered to their corner branch but regional lenders are under pressure from national giants like jpmorgan chase co and bank of america corp which are raking in deposits with digital apps big marketing budgets and coasttocoast branch networks low interest rates have hit especially hard at regional banks which rely more on breadandbutter loans than rivals with wall street arms deals are an obvious solution by closing branches in overlapping areas and trimming redundant technology budgets regional banks hope to merge their way to higher profits the deal wouldnt be pncs first acquisition of a foreign banks stateside operations it bought the us retail banking operations of royal bank of canada in for billion it also scooped up a handful of struggling institutions during the financial crisis including national city corp which was pushed by regulators to
