working with our intent for it is to be a shockingly effective customeracquisition channel for them where they end up with many many more customers said john collison stripes cofounder and president lapses at citi draw million fine federal regulators fined citigroup inc million and ordered the nations thirdlargest bank to fix its riskmanagement systems citing significant ongoing deficiencies in a consent order agreed to by the new york banks board the federal reserve faulted citigroup for falling short in various areas of risk management and internal controls including data management regulatory reporting and capital planning the office of the comptroller of the currency in a separate consent order also issued wednesday said the fine was punishment for the banks longstanding failure to remedy problems in its risk and datamanagement systems the wall street journal earlier reported that the fed and the occ were planning to reprimand citigroup for failing to improve its riskmanagement systems an expansive set of technology and procedures designed to detect problematic transactions risky trades and anything else that could harm the bank we are disappointed that we have fallen short of our regulators expectations and we are fully committed to thoroughly addressing the issues identified in the consent orders the bank said citi has significant remediation projects underway to strengthen our controls infrastructure and governance the public rebuke marks a major escalation of regulators efforts to get citigroup to fix its risk systems for years the fed and the occ have privately pushed citigroup chief executive michael corbat to give priority to an overhaul of the systems their decision to issue consent orders requiring the changes indicates that the pressure they were exerting behind the scenes wasnt enough the reprimand in the works for several months accelerated planning for mr corbats retirement mr corbat who said last month that he would step down in february felt the expensive multiyear overhaul was best left in the hands of his successor jane fraser the journal previously reported ms fraser is currently citigroups president and the head of its consumer bank the punishment while substantial is gentler than the rebuke wells fargo co got for weaknesses in its riskmanagement systems brought to light by its fakeaccount scandal the occ fined the bank in early more than billion and the fed imposed an unprecedented growth cap on the bank at issue at citigroup is the infrastructure underpinning the banks systems meant to identify risk and protect customer data many of citigroups various businesses for example run on their own independent systems that have their own methods for tracking customers and transactions there are hundreds of identification systems inside the bank a customer doing business with multiple parts of the bank could have different identification codes for each one regulators have long fretted that the hodgepodge of systems a legacy of a string of deals in the that turned citigroup into a financial powerhouse could make the bank vulnerable to costly and potentially damaging missteps a recent highprofile error citigroups accidental million payment to creditors of cosmetics company revlon inc gave credence to their concerns the consent orders from the occ and fed leave citigroup with a lengthy todo list the regulators ordered the bank to form a new board committee to oversee the risk overhaul and to develop plans for holding management accountable the occ order requires citigroup to seek approval for any acquisition and gives the regulator power to order the bank to replace managers or directors the fed and the occ already broadly exercise veto power over big purchases in its order the occ called out citigroups procedures for reporting problems within the bank to the board of directors and its leaders lack of clearly defined roles and responsibilities it said the bank failed to comply with multiple laws and regulations including the fair housing act the riskmanagement overhaul is expected to be an expensive undertaking chief financial officer mark mason had said the bank would spend billion on the work this year alone
