the board took into account the timing of his resignation the companys performance and the status of its outstanding regulatory matters according to the filing mr sloan a wells fargo veteran took the top job in as the bank was reeling from its fakeaccount scandal in which it was revealed to have created perhaps millions of unauthorized accounts he was perpetually in the crosshairs of regulators who believed he moved slowly to right the ship the wall street journal has reported he resigned shortly after testifying before the house financial services committee last year democrats in that group released a report this month in which they said mr sloan gave inaccurate and misleading testimony to the board republicans released their own report criticizing his leadership and characterizations to congress mr sloan told congress when he testified last year that he was moving diligently to address the problems that caused the scandal mr sloan received million in compensation last year he was replaced by charles scharf who took over in october mr scharfs annual pay was million in the bank said in the filing wells fargo co will pay billion to settle investigations by the justice department and the securities and exchange commission into its longrunning fake accounts scandal closing the door on a major portion of the legal problems that for years have beset one of the countrys largest banks the deal resolves civil and criminal investigations it includes a socalled deferred prosecution agreement in which the justice department reserves the right to pursue criminal charges the bank has to satisfy the governments requirements including its continued cooperation with further investigations over the next three years fridays settlement is a victory for charles scharf an outsider who took over as chief executive in october and was tasked with fixing the crisis that has claimed two ceos the conduct at the core of todays settlements and the past culture that gave rise to it are reprehensible and wholly inconsistent with the values on which wells fargo was built mr scharf said in a statement we are committing all necessary resources to ensure that nothing like this happens again while also driving wells fargo forward the bank though still faces major regulatory problems it is under sanction by the federal reserve which has taken the unusual step of capping the banks growth settling with the justice department and sec could allow the bank to focus on persuading the fed to lift the cap as part of the settlement wells fargo admitted that it unlawfully misused customers sensitive personal information and harmed some customers credit ratings collecting millions of dollars in fees and interest in the process the scandal severely damaged the banks reputation with customers and regulators alike providing a case study of sorts on how success in banking depends on customers trusting a firm enough to leave their money there it also has unsettled customers who have long thought of retail banking as a service that takes deposits and makes loans not a salesdriven industry hawking as many products as possible regulators first fined wells fargo over the sales practices in alleging that executives created a pressurecooker environment in branches where lowlevel employees were so beset by high sales goals that they opened up fake and unauthorized bank accounts afterward regulators and lawmakers were outraged not just by the allegations but by what they perceived as the banks slow response to them whats more with the bank under increasing scrutiny additional legal and regulatory problems sprang up across other business units including wealth management and foreignexchange trading what was once a fastgrowing lender whose profits towered above those of rivals became a firm with declining revenue that is leaning heavily on cost cuts the sec portion of the settlement accused the bank of misleading shareholders according to the charges wells fargo touted to investors its ability to sell additional products to current customers a practice known as crossselling even though numbers were inflated because of the fake accounts aside from fridays settlement regulators and prosecutors could still take action against former executives according to people familiar with the situation last month the office of the comptroller of the currency charged eight former executives over the fakeaccount scandal wells fargo traded its hardearned reputation for shortterm profits and harmed untold numbers of customers along the way nick hanna us attorney in los angeles said friday prosecutors said the practices date to when wells fargo began to rely more heavily on sales growth it pressured employees to cross sell additional products to current customers the heightened pressure pushed many employees to open checking and savings accounts without customer knowledge and make up identification numbers to activate unauthorized debit cards employees afraid they would be fired otherwise sometimes forged customer signatures to open accounts or altered customers contact information to prevent them from learning about unauthorized accounts the government said regulators and prosecutors said top managers knew of these issues years ago in an internal investigator called it a growing plague in a corporate investigations manager described the problem as spiraling out of control employees continued to raise concerns internally the government said it also said certain executives impeded the occ from scrutinizing the sales practices after the scandal erupted in top executives faced heavy criticism for holding lowerlevel employees responsible wells fargo fired thousands of branch employees but regulators lawmakers and even the banks own board questioned whether junior staffers were to blame a board investigation found that the banks decentralized structure allowed top executives to avoid addressing these issues as they got bigger without referring to her by name the justice department heavily criticized carrie tolstedt the former head of the consumer bank by regional executives were regularly raising objections to ms tolstedt about unlawful and unethical sales practices ms tolstedt is one of the former executives the occ charged last month her lawyer said friday she acted appropriately and in good faith at all times and the effort to scapegoat her is both unfair and unfounded at am one day last february construction work tripped a sophisticated fireextinguisher system in a minnesota data center used by wells fargo co knocking out power to servers housed in the building customers soon noticed the banks online and mobile banking systems were out for hours the outage brought into public view the technology failures that have been occurring behind the scenes at wells fargo for years antiquated systems have made it difficult for the bank to meet the demands of regulators who are closely scrutinizing the firm after its fakeaccount scandal according to more than a dozen current and former employees the firm has struggled with tasks like monitoring employee pay and building a new platform for financial advisers hampering key businesses we need to be a technology company chief executive charles scharf said in his first meeting with employees after taking the job in october saul van beurden his head of technology and another relatively new arrival said in an interview that his top priorities include fixing issues raised by regulators attracting talent and making sure key systems dont go offline again banking was once a business of ornate branches and large vaults but the sector now runs on digital systems designed to move money around keep cybercriminals out and knit the disparate parts of sprawling institutions together big banks spend billions on these tools employ tens of thousands of people to keep them running smoothly and use flashy mobile apps to compete for customers wells fargo says it was the first us lender to provide online banking in the a point of corporate pride but it fell behind in recent years current and former employees say a spokesman said the bank has made a number of improvements to its technology offerings including cardfree atms contactless debit cards and online mortgage applications in late the year before the fakeaccount scandal erupted the bank announced the departure of its chief information officer who reported to the ceo the bank didnt replace the tech chief and distributed his direct reports to other executives including an administrative head later placed on leave after regulators reprimanded her for oversight failures the reporting structure at times could be disorganized regulators for instance expect banks to keep meticulous records of each stage of internal technology projects in the unit overseeing initiatives like apple pay required documents were often missing and the processes for creating them and checking they were in place were largely manual said mark mcallister a project manager in the unit from to mr mcallister said he was fired after raising concerns about the lapses the bank spokesman said mr mcallister wasnt retaliated against but declined to elaborate further by june regulators had identified problems across wells fargos tech operations including software vulnerabilities cybersecurity concerns and riskmanagement inconsistencies the wall street journal previously reported last year the office of the comptroller of the currency told wells fargo to improve its humanresources functions including technology systems the agency in particular criticized the divisions manual processes for overseeing pay and performance for its employees according to a person familiar with the matter legions of tech workers at the bank are toiling to satisfy problems regulators have cited some relate to mundane topics like improving systems that control employee building access according to another person familiar with the matter other problems have affected customers like the onlineandmobile banking outage in early wells fargo said construction work in a room of important servers tripped the fire system releasing extinguishing chemicals into the air according to public records from the local fire department that triggered a shutdown of power to servers the bank said issues at a single data center arent supposed to knock out key bank systems which are meant to be routed to backups if they fail bank employees believe backup systems werent adequately tested to make sure they would come online quickly if the suburban minneapolis data center had a problem according to people familiar with the matter mr van beurden said fixing the list of items cited by regulators is his first priority he said he has also made changes to prevent another outage like removing that particular type of fireextinguisher system from data centers when the app is down the bank is down for our customers he said
