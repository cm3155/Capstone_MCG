capital one financial corporation q1 sen elizabeth warren d mass called for the biden administration to block capital ones acquisition of discover block capital ones merger with discover oped march because she believes that two firms are always better than one but this is a misunderstanding of how competition works one need only look at the broader industry visa mastercard and american express control more than of creditclearing transactions to realize the folly of the manysmallfirms approach if the deal is approved there will be more competition in the industry not less competition in the market over the past three decades has streamlined technology and reduced costs to the point where creditcard acceptance is nearly universal providing a smaller network like discover with the financial power of capital one creates an environment where fees can fall and security can improve its time to put the econ definition of competition back on college blackboards and bring real competition to the financialservices industry prof michael c munger duke university durham nc mastercard and visa have a combined trillion market capitalization reflecting the persistent profits resulting from their control of card payments the pricing power they enjoy has repeatedly been shown by academics and others to be to the detriment of consumers and merchants alike discover is a potentially potent tool to breach the moat protecting this payments oligopoly yet the deal announced by capital one has provoked a rather tepid market response the deal value of billion and potential incremental profits of billion referenced by sen warren and additional benefits not referenced by her are rounding errors compared with the magnitude of the issue at hand she should be asking why the deal seems to have generated such a muted response it isnt the merger introducing more concentration and risk that makes the deal of questionable social value it is that the deal grossly fails to realize the potential to enhance market competition adam hurwich new york sen warren presents many reasons for blocking the merger including its potential to increase risks in our economy would the merger be more harmful to our economy than the countrys trillion national debt i think not perhaps she and her congressional colleagues should worry about the financial problems they have created and the resultant risks to our economy paul stewart quincy mass capital one said it will buy discover financial services for more than billion in a deal that will marry two of the largest creditcard companies in the us under the terms of the allstock deal discover shareholders are set to receive capital one shares for each discover share representing a premium of about based on discovers closing price friday after the deal closes capital one shareholders will hold roughly of the combined company with discover shareholders owning the rest capital one is making a big bet at a booming time in the creditcard sector more consumers are moving from paying with cash to cards as a result of generous rewards programs and the digitization of commerce a transition that accelerated with the pandemic a recent increase in creditcarddebt has provided a further boost to issuers buying discover would give capital one a creditcard lender with a market value of a little over billion a network that would vastly increase its power in the payments ecosystem card networks are critical to enabling transactions and setting fees that merchants pay when consumers shop with credit cards though much smaller than visa and mastercard discover is one of the few competitors to those companies in the us and it is one of a small number of card issuers that also has a payments network capital one the ninthlargest bank in the country and a major creditcard issuer uses visa and mastercard for most of its cards the bank plans to switch at least some of its cards to the discover network while continuing to use visa and mastercard on others those larger networks have more merchant acceptance abroad than discover does capital one also plans to maintain the discover brand on the cards and network assuming regulators sign off and the deal is consummated discover based in riverwoods ill is an online institution so the takeover wouldnt come with physical bank branches except for one location in delaware the deal follows a tumultuous period for discover that has included increased regulatory scrutiny and a change in leadership the company disclosed last year that an internal review found it had misclassified certain creditcard accounts beginning in incorrectly placing them in the highest merchantandacquirer pricing tier the company established a liability of million to account for estimated compensation owed to merchants and acquirers separately discover received a consent order from the federal deposit insurance corp in october discover said it would address the fdic order to improve its consumercompliance operations in december discover said financialindustry executive michael rhodes would become its chief executive officer and president he took over from john owen who had been serving in the interim after roger hochschild stepped down in august discover has been approached by large banks and technology companies about an acquisition of all or a part of its business over the past decade or more tech companies have been interested in acquiring its network so that they can play a more central role in payments but prior senior executives at discover werent interested in separating the companys creditcard lending side from the network for capital one the deal would also further expand the number of cardholders it will count as customers for its creditcard lending business many discover cardholders have high credit scores discover also has consumer deposits most of which are in savings accounts allowing capital one to continue to expand its already large presence in that area for about a decade now big us banks have aggressively competed for customers by rolling out new credit cards or enhancing their existing ones with more cashback offers or points programs that dangle the possibility of free or discounted airfare hotel stays or other travel perks creditcard debt fell during the pandemic but is rising again that translates into lucrative interest charges that cardholders pay to the banks that issue their credit cards issuers face the risk of rising delinquencies and loan losses however if unemployment rises or a recession occurs rising creditcard usage is also a boon to the billions of dollars in interchange fees banks collect every year the fees are set by card networks and paid by merchants when consumers shop with cards by owning the discover network capital one could negotiate interchange fees and other terms directly with merchants for card transactions that travel over its network making capital one more of a competitor to visa and mastercard an acquisition of discover would rank among the biggest deals so far in after a lull in ma activity in as economic and other uncertainty and increased interest rates took a bite out of the appetite for deals volumes have gotten off to a relatively strong start and are up in the us compared with a year earlier according to dealogic
