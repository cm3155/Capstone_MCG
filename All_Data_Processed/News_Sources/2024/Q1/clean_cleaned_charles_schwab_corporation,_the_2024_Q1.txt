charles schwab corporation the q1 charles schwab last year weathered a banking crisis layoffs and a sharp drop in its stock price inside the company employees are preparing for another uncertain year the largest publicly traded us brokerage last wednesday reported a third consecutive quarter of yearoveryear revenue and profit declines hit hard by higher interest rates net income in dropped to billion shares fell last year and are down more than in to date on a conference call executives said financial results should improve in the year ahead setting schwab up for growth in and beyond but they described as transitional and dependent on factors that are difficult to predict the trajectory of interest rates the stock market and the behavior of new clients last year there were some challenges lets not kid ourselves james kostulias head of trading services said in an interview earlier this month now that were past the vast vast majority of that i think there will be more time energy and resources we can devote to innovation to growing the business schwab founded some years ago grew from a discount brokerage for main street into a personalfinance supermarket that came to rival wall street firms as an assetgathering machine while schwab cut fees and made less revenue from trading it minted money sweeping cash from its brokerage customers into bank deposits that paid out little interest when rates were low it worked well for schwab customers were content keeping their money at the bank when there were few alternatives for better yield that business model was put to the test last year when the federal reserve continued to aggressively raise interest rates yieldhungry customers moved money into options like moneymarket funds since early schwab has lost some billion in bank deposits or nearly of what it held at its peak trading activity also stalled since customers could make robust returns just parking their money in cashlike investments the company has said customer funds largely stayed at schwab when clients moved money from bank deposits to other investments still with bank deposits fleeing schwab had to turn to pricier funding that cut into profits like borrowing from the federal home loan bank system and issuing certificates of deposit last march the collapse of several regional banks put schwab in the spotlight the company had invested chunks of its balance sheet in longerterm bonds when rates were low when rates rose the value of those bonds fell schwabs shares lost more than onethird of their value in just a month inside schwab last spring employees were largely unconcerned at least initially chief executive and cochairman walt bettinger reassured employees that the company was on solid footing he bought about million of schwabs stock appeared on cnbc and told the wall street journal that the company could continue to operate even if it lost most of its deposits then in july the mood shifted bettinger said on an earnings call that schwab would reduce its head count and office space the moves would cut expenses by about million a year he said the plan blindsided even some managing directors at schwab who were usually clued in to corporate decisions current and former employees describe feeling frustrated with what they say is a lack of clear communication from the highest level of leadership to everyone else schwab is led by an executive council consisting of founder and board cochair charles r chuck schwab bettinger president rick wurster chief financial officer peter crawford and about a dozen executives representing various arms of the company including kostulias the impending layoffs sapped morale rumors spread with employees speculating on the date and size of the job cuts some managers found it was difficult to motivate their teams employee engagement dropped according to an internal survey a company spokeswoman said we acknowledge the last year was challenging for our employees and know that anytime a firm undergoes layoffs it will have an impact on morale however despite those challenges our quarterly engagement data tells us that our employees remained highly engaged throughout the year and committed to delivering for our clients meanwhile employees also began executing one of the largest brokerage integrations in history schwab had bought td ameritrade in and last year it began moving millions of td ameritrade customers to schwab accounts the first four rounds of customer conversions moved over about of client accounts with no major complications according to schwab schwab said customer attrition from the integration is tracking below projections and called the conversion so far a success still not all customers were happy clients from td ameritrade pulled billions of dollars of assets from their accounts last year once customers were switched over some felt schwabs platform technology was inferior and had a hard time getting answers to their questions for independent advisory firms that use the brokerage as a custodian for client assets their td ameritrade customerservice representatives remained assigned to them through the transition according to former employees that meant those customerservice representatives were also new to working with the schwab platform making it difficult to help customers with questions the schwab spokeswoman said the company continues to listen to client feedback and has made platform updates the company said it understood customers might have strong preferences for one platform but it has worked to acclimate clients to the new system in october schwab held its annual conference for investment advisers some employees at the conference returned to work the following monday to find they were being laid off in all schwab cut about employees roughly of its workforce the work needed to come through this change even stronger than before is just beginning bettinger and wurster said in an internal message about the layoffs wurster was promoted to president in and is widely viewed as the heir apparent to the ceo job schwab hasnt publicly announced any succession plans bettinger has told employees that schwab isnt planning any more major layoffs many remain on edge the company said it has seen promising signs that customers movement of cash out of bank deposits is nearing an end transactional sweep cash client cash that hasnt been invested yet increased month over month in november and december schwab reported bank deposits increased quarter over quarter at the end of for the first time since early schwab expects to boost profitability in the year ahead as it pays down more of its shortterm borrowing the company expects that by the end of it could consider resuming share buybacks which it paused in
