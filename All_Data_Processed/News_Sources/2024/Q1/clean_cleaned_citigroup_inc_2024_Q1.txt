citigroup inc q1 banking finance citi hires raghavan from rival jpmorgan hires raghavan from rival citigroup named jpmorgan chases viswas raghavan as head of banking turning to an old rival to fill a key senior role at the bank raghavan joined jpmorgan in and most recently served as head of investment banking at citi he will run one of the banks five core businesses and report directly to chief executive jane fraser raghavan will arrive as fraser and her management team press ahead with citis most ambitious restructuring plan in years while also working to modernize its technology and internal controls his appointment also ends a guessing game on wall street in its search citi had reached out to some of the industrys most prominent investment bankers peter babej who served as interim banking head during the search will now follow through on his plan to retire from citi citi shares finished mondays trading lower at citigroup can avoid another false dawn the banks stock has outperformed in recent months but coming reports may be key financial analysis and commentary there are few more dangerous words in finance than this time is different but for citigroup perhaps it is safer to say that at the very least this time is not quite the same over the past three months citigroup shares have led the way among the big six us global banks rising more than in that time but the banks stock has trapped bargainhunting investors before back in its shares soundly outperformed peers including jpmorgan chase with a rise of more than since february however it has been the only one of the big six us megabanks to have a negative return according to factset data last year at times it ended the trading day at less than half its tangible book value a level it hadnt been below in over a decade over this recent span the bank dealt with major challenges including a regulatory consent order a management transition a technology infrastructure overhaul business exits and a sharp slowdown in wall street activity as bank stocks started to recover late last year so did citigroup coming from such a deep discount chief executive jane frasers longterm strategic plan began to gear up with eliminations of management layers and a realignment of units and when chief financial officer mark mason in december told analysts that the bank was expecting expenses to come down in it was a strong indicator yet the question remains whether this will be another false dawn certainly it would be extraordinary if there were no setbacks in the banks plans citigroup has at times kept living up to its reputation for stepping on rakes and rebuilding a global bank in flight is hardly straightforward it also is a tricky time for markets in general after a surprising stock rally in and a looming federal reserve policy pivot but the bank remains heavily discounted still trading at about of tangible book value so setbacks are arguably priced in something working in the banks favor is that even some bullish analysts such as wells fargos mike mayo arent basing their calls on the bank hitting its return targets those include a mediumterm jump to an to return on tangible common equity up from annualized in the first nine months of back in whether the bank was going to hit its thentarget loomed over the shares in what was in retrospect perhaps an unhealthy way hitting targets can be signs of fundamental progress they can also be artificial goal posts that distract investors from underlying problems and sustainable progress the next few quarterly reports for citigroup might be vital ones there will be justified focus on updates on expenses and capital needs on the revenue side important things to watch for include continued revenue growth from its crownjewel services business which does things like payments and custody for corporations and institutions another would be indications of more revenue to come from wealth management a strategic priority but one that so far hasnt lived up to managements aspirations the danger would be to put too much faith in cyclical upswings like an improvement in volatile trading or deal making units faster revenue growth would certainly be a huge help for hitting targets but it alone cant break the boomandbust cycle likewise slower revenue growth also doesnt mean the bank cant achieve any sustained improvement in returns under fraser citigroup has shown it is at least possible to change the narrative around the stock but the job is far from done
