whose network includes more than restaurants bars and other venues according to its website american express also said on friday that it had acquired rooam a platform for contactless payments that is used in bars restaurants stadiums and other venues it did not disclose the sum it would pay for the platform a decade ago it was common to ask if younger americans were falling out of love with plastic the reasons offered were many they had seen their parents deal with card debt they didnt care about frequentflier miles and they had new alternatives like buynowpaylater loans one company saddled with that baggage was american express amexs thenchief executive acknowledged that its financial performance was disappointing the stocks forward pricetoearnings ratio fell to under times in early an unusually low level for the company fast forward to amex shares are now zooming up over this year the stock has returned an annualized since the start of beating the sp 500s annualized return by almost percentage points it is now trading at over times forward earnings and at its investor day presentation in april amexs current chief executive stephen squeri reiterated the companys belief that it can deliver 10plus annual revenue growth over the long term younger card members have been one driving force over threequarters of new accounts acquired in for us consumer premium gold and platinum cards were gen z or millennialaged according to company figures it appears that many of amexs young consumers are going straight to cards such as the 695annualfee platinum rather than starting with nofee cards and working their way up it may be the case that a cohort of millennials some of whom started their financial lives around the time of the financial crisis did feel some reluctance about credit cards but gen z members who have entered early adulthood may not suffer the same hangup transunion found in a recent study that of gen z consumers in the study had at least one credit card at ages to this was significantly higher than the of millennials at the same ages a decade ago transunion found roughly half of us families headed by someone under age held creditcard balances back in according to the federal reserves survey of consumer finances it was about the same percentage in the latest survey in in transunions study more earlyadult members of gen z were days or more late with debt payments than millennials at a similar age years prior that is partly reflective of current conditions across credit for all borrowers consumer delinquency rates are higher across many credit products than in according to transunion data of course the younger people coming to amex for premium cards arent necessarily representative of their entire generation the companys data suggest its us gen z and millennial consumers have higher incomes and credit scores than the same groups across the industry many are likely coming for the rewards of spending over the last several years including during the pandemic when travel briefly lost its allure amex has been refreshing its card rewards and perks this has included credits for a range of nontravel activities such as streaming video services and food delivery the annual fees dont appear to be as much of a barrier either theyve been raised on subscription fees howard grosfield amexs president of us consumer services says of younger card members they do the mental math of am i getting value in excess of the subscription fee amex has called out benefits aimed at experiences and in particular dining as a notable driver millennial and gen z us consumers on average use their cards at restaurants over more often than older spenders amex says from when amex acquired online reservation platform resy to its us consumer dining spending grew about faster than us dining spending overall as measured by retail sales data via resy amex offers features like what it calls exclusive reservations or priority notify for available tables perhaps the appeal of this is no surprise gen z is a generation that is coming of age at a time when waiting lists for a choice restaurant might be a thousand names long among investors several years ago the big concern was will amex be able to pivot their brand to focus on the young says craig maurer codirector of equity research at financial technology partners well they have been able to continually refresh the value proposition to appeal to younger consumers naturally satisfying demand for perks doesnt come free amex has reported rising costs of cardmember rewards and services these costs were about of revenue prepandemic then in this also reflects a shift in amexs spending mix toward more premium consumer cards the company says it currently expects this expense line to grow faster than revenue gen z and millennial cardholders may be the most engaged with rewards but they can also be the pickiest according to a recent survey study of over us consumers from market research provider pymnts intelligence in that study of gen z respondents reported discontent with their creditcard rewards programs well above what it was for other generations plus the more important rewards become to a customer the more may be at stake if they dont work out as anticipated the consumer financial protection bureau has reported that in it received over more consumer complaints about creditcard rewards than prepandemic with issues such as problems redeeming benefits or having benefits devalued competition for these young engaged and affluent spenders who will be lucrative customers for years to come will surely be fierce notably robinhood markets recently launched its own gold card a cashback card it has even offered cards actually made of gold for users who make a certain number of referrals to justify ongoing investment in enticing young power spenders spending growth needs to keep up amex can find other cost efficiencies it can continue to keep credit losses low and expand other ways to monetize card members like by offering more lending amex believes it can deliver midteens earningspershare growth to accompany that 10plus revenue growth with the stock already trading around record highs expanding profitability while still keeping young customers spending may be key to also rewarding shareholders
