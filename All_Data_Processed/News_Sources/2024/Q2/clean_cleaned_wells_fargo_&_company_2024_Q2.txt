as requested a wells fargo creditcard deal struggles after misjudgments when charlie scharf took over as ceo of wells fargo one of his priorities was to expand the banks creditcard business now a flashy partnership with a startup is complicating a highprofile part of that strategy in wells launched a credit card with bilt technologies a fintech startup with bigname backers including blackstone and mastercard the cobranded card came with a rare perk users can pay for rent with it without incurring fees from their landlords while also earning rewards points more than one million accounts were activated in the first months many by young adults but wells is losing as much as million every month on the program as savvy customers flock to the card according to current and former employees executives made internal projections on key revenue drivers such as the likelihood that cardholders would carry balances that turned out to be inaccurate the san francisco bank has stopped bidding on new cobranded creditcard programs executives wells recruited for such programs have left and the bank is launching more credit cards that dont involve partners a wellsexpedia credit card that was agreed to previously is expected to be the final launch for some time the financial losses triggered a renegotiation of the program that has been under way for months wells has told bilt that it doesnt intend to renew the contract which is scheduled to end in unless economics are changed in its favor a wells spokeswoman said cobrands are a modest piece of the banks creditcard strategy as with all new card launches it takes multiple years for the initial launch to pay off the spokeswoman said we look forward to continuing to work together to make sure its a win for both bilt and wells fargo a bilt spokesman said that the wall street journals reporting is an inaccurate representation of the partnership and that the company is committed to a longterm partnership with wells fargo that benefits all parties the creditcard program helped catapult bilts valuation to billion in a january fundraising round up from billion in late ken chenault the former longtime american express chief executive officer joined bilts board this year wells itself has invested at least million in bilt according to people familiar with the matter an unusual arrangement in the world of credit cards the partnership has helped lift 34yearold bilt ceo ankur jain to billionaire status there is a reason why credit cards hadnt gained traction in the rent sector until bilt came along most landlords didnt accept them because they refuse to pay card fees that get pocketed by the banks issuing them and often run between and bilt structured the card so landlords wont incur the fees wells instead eats much of that about six months after the credit card was launched wells began paying bilt a fee of about of each rent transaction even though the bank isnt collecting interchange fees from landlords wells earns interchange fees every time people use the card to pay for anything but rent and splits those fees with bilt wells also pays bilt each time a new card account is issued such arrangements are often reserved for airline and other established creditcard programs jain founded bilt in the startup needed a bank partner to issue a credit card since it couldnt underwrite or lend on its own its first issuer was evolve bank trust a small tennessee bank but bilt wanted to ultimately go bigger several lenders including us bancorp and synchrony financial passed jain also spoke with jpmorgan chase to gauge its interest in the bilt platform some wells employees thought the proposition was crazy but the bank needed a win and figured bilt would garner buzz and help attract younger customers a deal also presented mortgage crossselling opportunities bilts cardholders will ultimately want to become homeowners the thought process at wells went and the bank would be wellpositioned to give them mortgages that hasnt come to pass and at any rate wells has pulled back from mortgage lending few projections that wells had for the card have panned out the bank assumed around of cardpurchase volume would be nonrent generating interchangefee revenue the reality is inverted wells expected that around half to threefourths of dollars charged to the card would carry over from month to month generating interest charges the reality ranges between around and many customers would pay their rent off within a few days of charging it to their cards weeks before their statements arrived a strategy savvy cardholders use just to earn points wells has told bilt that cardholder behavior isnt providing a path for profitability for the bank and that more customers who carry balances and use the card for everyday purchases are needed bilt meanwhile hasnt been satisfied with how wells is marketing the partnership wells has replaced some of its marketing of the bilt card in branches on its atms and elsewhere with that of its own generalpurpose cards the program has also been hit by fraud random account numbers and expiration dates are generated when new cards are given to customers but the process for the bilt card wasnt so random which opened the door to swindlers last summer they created fake bilt card accounts and went shopping with them leading to losses for wells the partnership also poses moneylaundering risk which the companies have worked to address when consumers charge rent to their cards a thirdparty company sends a check for that amount to the person or entity the cardholder says is the landlord that is easy for bilt to track when it is one of the realestate companies that participate in its rewards program and hard when it is a momandpop landlord or other company a wells representative said the bank hasnt experienced any meaningful moneylaundering issues with bilt business news wells fargo excfo starts new chapter executive plots path at venturebacked solarfinancing company goodleap john shrewsberry former finance chief of wells fargo is aiming to accelerate growth at goodleap the solar and homeenergy financing company shrewsberry is embarking on a new chapter at goodleap which announced his appointment as chief financial officer in december he had stepped down as wells fargos cfo in after six years in the role and stayed on at the bank through the following spring most of his tenure overlapped the banks fakeaccounts scandal and he was among the few top executives to stay in his position through that period he continued to oversee the banks finances into the early days of the pandemic fintech goodleap is a new arena for the longtime bank executive the company through software used by contractors originates consumer loans for solar and other homeenergy efficiency projects roofing windows and heat pumps goodleap which makes most of its money selling and servicing loans is profitable and cashflow positive meaning it doesnt rely on its investors for incremental funding the company has raised a total of billion from investors including new enterprise associates westcap and bdt msd partners cfo journal spoke with shrewsberry about his career move his priorities for the cfo role and what venturebacked companies look for in a finance chief below are condensed and edited excerpts wsj how did you get to goodleap shrewsberry i retired from wells in i had been the cfo for years and had been there for over years i went into investandadvise mode for a couple of years and lived my best life we all worked remotely after years probably being on the east coast at least twice a month i went through a year of covid lockdown wsj what were you investing in and advising shrewsberry it was a little bit of fintech but a lot of earlystage things i created a nice little portfolio and i thought frankly i would probably do that until end of days after a couple of years i decided i should do one more operating role im in my my wife encouraged me to think about working really dedicating myself to a company i met hayes hayes barnard goodleaps chief executive through a cfo friend of mine mark hawkins who was the cfo at salesforce when hayes needed a new cfo he said to mark who do you know who can do x y and z wsj whats the through line in your career from wells to goodleap shrewsberry this is a scaled full unicorn scale in terms of the capital it has raised the valuations it has achieved its a company that over some number of years three four five six who knows how long will probably put itself in a position to i dont know whether an ipo is the path that it will go down but theres some sort of event in its future wsj if not an ipo a sale shrewsberry who knows but a valuecreation destination what this company does and what aligns with my lifes work is theres a big lending component to this company theres a lot of investor relations and capital raising at the asset level where were originating many billions of dollars worth of loans they need to find homes with banks with credit unions with asset managers with life insurance companies with others theres a lot of capitalraising to do theres a lot of structured finance theres a lot of interestrate risk management theres a big treasury component then theres the how do we create a valuable company the through line is its a big enough company where it needs hardcore accounting and finance that supports what it will be in its next chapter wsj could the company just operate as a large private business is that an end goal shrewsberry it could especially with strong enough cash flow these investors would at some level just as soon receive distributions year after year whenever it makes sense for that to be the case like all venture investors they have to figure out how to repatriate capital back to their lps limited partners that usually causes at some point the need to have a transaction that liquefies them but thats not in sight right now wsj what are your top priorities for the role shrewsberry the top priority is to prepare the company for growth whenever the future happens the more weve executed on the growth plan the more valuable the company will be so its helping to expand product helping to expand markets helping to expand the categories that were involved in making sure youve got the capital weve got the right business model the right unitlevel economics we prioritize properly we measure results properly and we make the company as big diverse and resilient as possible wsj what do you think venturebacked companies are looking for in a finance chief shrewsberry it depends in our case its somebody who is comfortable at this scale i think for laterstage venturebacked companies a cfo that has operated at a higher scale is in a position whenever it happens to go from where we are to whats next marketfacing and maybe maybe not somebody whos been around the block a few times the more cycles we go through the more beneficial it is to have people who have taken their lumps in a prior cycle wsj goodleap and other companies in the sector are facing legal pressure from state attorneys general over issues including fee disclosures do you see it as part of your role to prepare the company for this type of pressure shrewsberry the company has done a nice and sophisticated job of preparing itself it has a real compliance function at some level we would welcome some national regulation in the space to create a level playing field so that the weakest hands dont have an opportunity to sully the expectation of the experience from the consumers perspective wsj do regulatory issues cross your desk shrewsberry i work closely with the legal team and the compliance team just to really understand exactly where we stand and the elements of financial risk you dont want disenchanted customers out there who dont get what they bargained for
