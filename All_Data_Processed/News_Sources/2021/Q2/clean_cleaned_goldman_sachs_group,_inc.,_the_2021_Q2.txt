effectively to spur growth the new firm to be called growthcurve capital will focus on companies in the technology healthcare and financial and informationservices sectors and target deals with an enterprise value between million and billion firm officials said mr rajpal who left goldman in february after a 20year career at the investment bank has hired people for the new firm including three

privateequity firm new mountain capital will run healthcare investing mr rajpal has also recruited four operating executives with specialties in digital transformation artificial intelligence data analytics and human capital unlike at most buyout shops where operational specialists are often brought in to evaluate strategy and improve companies after they have been acquired these executives will sit on growthcurves investment committee and evaluate deals when they are first proposed firm officials said the operating partners will help growthcurve identify companies in possession of valuable data sets that havent been tapped because of a lack of awareness technological knowhow or financial resources now is the right time for private equity to embrace the potential of data analytics and ai mr rajpal said in an interview hedge funds and the fintech industry have more readily adopted those disciplines he said mr rajpal joined goldman in and was named a partner in as head of the merchant banks financial and informationservices investing business he led some of its topreturning deals including an investment in creditreporting bureau transunion that produced more than billion in profit he became cohead of the merchant bank in mr rajpal also had an early hand in building goldmans consumer bank known as marcus pitching thenchief executive lloyd blankfein on the idea in technology goldman seeks startup investors bank has raised more than billion from clients to invest in young companies goldman sachs group inc wants to help its clients get a piece of the next big startup gs growth a unit of the bank that buys stakes in maturing startups around the world with the firms money spent recent months courting outside investors according to people familiar with the matter its first client fund west street global growth partners raised more than billion by early may capital that will be invested in fastgrowing closely held companies in the financialtechnology businesssoftware consumer and healthcare sectors the people said recent investments earmarked for the fund include british digital bank starling bank ltd indian fooddelivery startup swiggy and regulationtechnology company complyadvantage the people said the demand could be huge endowments family offices and other institutional investors tired of low interest rates are anxious to get an early slice of the next potential robinhood markets inc or roblox corp and goldman which has long relied on businesses such as trading that have high highs and low lows is eager for the steadier revenue streams that come from earning management fees on clients money the category that gs growth plans to focus on growth equity includes startups that have rapidly expanding customer bases and revenue but arent quite ready for an initial public offering the asset class is becoming an investor favorite with more than billion flowing into growthequity funds since according to data provider preqin ltd an earlier effort to invest goldman clients money into startups had mixed results a growthequity fund from goldman sachs investment partners run out of the banks assetmanagement division had some notable winners such as an early bet on fintech startup plaid inc there was also at least one highprofile loser outcome health whose founders were criminally charged with running a billion fraud scheme they have pleaded not guilty and are awaiting trial the competitive challenges have only grown greater since then in recent years privateequity firms such as blackstone group inc hedge funds like tiger global management and venture firms such as sequoia capital have each raised multibilliondollar growth funds and while the goldman name might go far with fintech players especially because the bank could become a major customer for many of those companies it is often outshined in silicon valley there founders of nonfinancial startups are often more likely to have peter thiel marc andreessen and other venture capitalists at the top of their funding wish lists and goldman is less able to play kingmaker some of the firms that gs growth will have to compete with like tiger global and softbank group corp have distinguished themselves on both the speed at which they deploy capital and the size of the checks they are willing to write goldman employs a more regimented due diligence and approval process than other firms and has historically been constrained in the amounts it is willing to invest some of the people said where gs growth hopes to have an advantage is in its global footprint and relationship network the more than investment professionals in the group are fanned out across the americas europe and asia to connect with startup chief executive officers at a local level its three leaders darren cohen nishi somaiya and stephanie hui are based in new york london and hong kong respectively the bank can also leverage the connections of goldmans investment bankers and private wealth managers for introductions to undertheradar entrepreneurs where capital is abundant having that edge in sourcing is what allows you to be one of the worlds best ms somaiya said group helps attract outside money goldman formed gs growth two years ago the idea was to bring together the separate fiefs within goldman that used the banks balance sheet to invest in startups each had slightly different mandates but didnt clearly broadcast them or their holdings to the general public most didnt even have websites that occasionally led to mission creep entrepreneurs were confused and goldman portfolio managers were annoyed when different teams at the bank contacted the same company with seemingly no coordination some of the people said goldman hoped that creating the new group would also help it attract outside money more broadly goldman wants to invest clients money in any number of socalled alternative assets such as leveraged buyouts distressed debt and other hardtoaccess deals the bank said in a recent filing that it had raised about billion in investor money for alternative assets well on its way toward a goal to raise billion by that number doesnt include gs growths contributions the billion the client fund raised beat goldmans target and it is continuing to raise money people familiar with the matter said uber executive tapped to run goldman
