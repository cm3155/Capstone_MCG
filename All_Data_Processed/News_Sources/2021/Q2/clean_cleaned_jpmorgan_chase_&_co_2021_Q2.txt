for privatelabel mortgages which are packaged and sold to investors without a guarantee from a governmentbacked firm like fannie mae the market has been growing during this years hot housing market the investment bank has contributed additional venture capital funding to maxex llc a growing digital exchange for residential mortgages executives at both companies said terms of the deal werent disclosed maxex connects sellers and buyers of the home loans providing standardized documentation so they can be easily purchased by financial firms those firms invest in the loans or bundle them into mortgagebacked bonds or securitizations they sell to others if theres a segment of finance that has lagged in utilization of technology its the mortgage business its remarkably inefficient said james bennison an executive at insurer arch capital group which bought about million of loans on the maxex platform this year maxex provides a clearinghouse where mortgage lenders can sell loans and where large banks and asset managers can buy them the company which launched in conducts due diligence on the loans it lists for sale and uses a standardized contract for buyers and sellers streamlining the trading process said chief executive tom pearce loans funded on the platform averaged about billion a month this year jpmorgan has traded about billion this year up from billion in all of according to mr pearce and marc simpson a managing director at jpmorgan the bank helped finance maxexs launch and is investing the new funds to help the platform attract other large banks and institutional investors to increase trading activity they said the market for privatelabel mortgage bonds played a central role in the financial crisis it grew mightily in the years leading up to the crash but investors got burned when millions of homeowners stopped paying their mortgages today governmentbacked giants fannie mae freddie mac and ginnie mae dominate the us mortgage industry guaranteeing more than threequarters of the mortgages originated last year wall street banks and investors have long tried to restart the privatelabel market with limited success it remains a tiny fraction of the home lending industry and originations effectively shut down during the early days of the pandemic last year jpmorgan chase co agreed to buy digital wealth manager nutmeg saving and investment ltd part of a push to establish a retail banking presence in the uk nutmeg founded in has more than customers and gbp billion under management the equivalent of around billion a price for the acquisition wasnt disclosed but people familiar with the transaction said it was about billion jpmorgan said in january it would launch a new digital bank in the uk offering consumer banking services there for the first time called chase it is currently being tested internally with jpmorgan employees ahead of a public launch later this year nutmegs savings and investment products wont initially be offered through the retail banking project the bank said jpmorgan is entering a crowded digital banking marketplace in the uk regulators encouraged new startups including starling bank ltd and monzo bank ltd to boost competition in the wake of the last global financial crisis these socalled challenger banks have forced traditional lenders to improve their digital offerings but have struggled to earn profits jpmorgan last year considered making a bid for starling bank founded by anne boden in according to people familiar with the situation jpmorgan previously tried to launch a digital bank in us cities and markets where it didnt have chase branches but closed the product called finn in june after slow pickup bank executives have said they learned lessons from that program including that the chase brand resonated better than a new name nutmeg aims to make wealth management more accessible through the internet neil alexander the companys chief executive said in a statement nutmeg was chosen as a name because the spice like wealth and investment services was once rare and costly but is now widely available like other investment sites it sells access to funds etfs and pensions nutmeg appeals to investment novices avoids jargon and provides tools and qas about the ins and outs of the finance world the companys revenue grew in to gbp million from the previous year and its loss increased to gbp million its shareholders who will be bought out in the deal include goldman sachs group inc and schroders plc the uk asset manager the resilience of big banks lending books may be the big news this quarter but their wall street arms may not be getting enough credit for their own performance jpmorgan chase and wells fargo have started doing what investors were expecting which is to release reserves for potential credit losses taken at the height of the pandemics economic shock defaults havent materialized to the levels feared and the economy looks to be on an upswing jpmorgan released billion worth of reserves in the first quarter and wells fargo released billion that is important to see but ultimately these are paper profits not more cash to be put to work reserve releases also dont necessarily get fully reflected back into the banks core equity capital since regulators gave banks a form of pandemic relief by delaying some of the impact of loss reserving on key capital levels it is core capital not just earnings that is needed to fuel banks shares further as growing deposits weigh down balance sheets this is key to avoid constraints on future lending when demand picks up or buybacks to boost returns in the meantime jpmorgan issued billion worth of preferred shares in the quarter as it had said may be needed to stay well clear of leverageratio minimum levels given these constraints the even better news for investors is that core wall street businesses are generating huge earnings without needing to use substantially more capital that wasnt always the case as volatility and volumes could sometimes force banks to take on even more risk to keep up jpmorgan said its corporate and investment banks return on equity was in the first quarter up from in the fourth quarter that figure was just at the end of at goldman sachs global markets return on average common equity was up over percentage points over the quarter to about this may be part of a larger shift on wall street after years of steppedup regulation and technology change a study by bank analysts at morgan stanley and consultants at oliver wyman found that in every dollar of revenue in markets and investment banking required less balance sheet and less valueatrisk than years earlier good performance from capital efficient units such as merger advisory also helps wall street revenues may be near or at their cyclical high but then again they may not be if the us economy is about to enter a multiyear boom as jpmorgan chief executive jamie dimon now says he expects that should turn up plenty of opportunities for banks trading desks ma advisers and so on not to mention their ordinary lending business on a pricetotangible book value basis jpmorgan and goldman sachs are trading near fiveyear highs but on a pricetoforwardearnings basis they are still significantly cheaper than the sp at about and of the index respectively historically such discounts reflected banks capital intensiveness and earnings volatility but there are signs now that both are improving banks have just been through a reallife stress test featuring a onceinacentury pandemic and a surge in unemployment to doubledigit levels their strong performance suggests banks discount to the rest of the stock market may be bigger than it needs to be in his annual letter to shareholders the chief executive of jpmorgan chase weighed in on the nations economy climate change and tax loopholes the annual letter to shareholders by jpmorgan chases chief executive jamie dimon was published early wednesday the letter which is widely read on wall street is not just an overview of the banks business but also covers mr dimons thoughts on everything from leadership lessons to public policy prescriptions the us economy will likely boom a combination of excess savings deficit spending vaccinations and euphoria around the end of the pandemic mr dimon wrote may create a boom that could easily run into that could justify high stock valuations but not the price of us debt given the huge supply soon to hit the market there is a chance that a rise in inflation will be more than temporary he wrote forcing the federal reserve to raise interest rates aggressively rapidly raising rates to offset an overheating economy is a typical cause of a recession he wrote but he hopes for the goldilocks scenario of fast growth gently increasing inflation and a measured rise in interest rates banks are playing an increasingly smaller role in the financial system mr dimon cited competition from an already large shadow banking system and fintech companies as well as amazon apple facebook google and now walmart he argued that those nonbank competitors should be more strictly regulated their growth has partially been made possible by avoiding banking rules he wrote and when it comes to tougher regulation of big banks he wrote the cost to the economy of having failsafe banks may not be worth it chinas leaders believe that america is in decline the united states has faced tough times before but today the chinese see an america that is losing ground in technology infrastructure and education a nation torn and crippled by politics as well as racial and income inequality and a country unable to coordinate government policies fiscal monetary industrial regulatory in any coherent way to accomplish national goals he wrote unfortunately recently there is a lot of truth to this the solution is not as simple as walking away from fossil fuels addressing climate change doesnt mean abandoning companies that produce and use fossil fuels mr dimon wrote but working with them to reduce their environmental impact he sees huge opportunity in sustainable and lowcarbon technologies and businesses and plans to evaluate clients progress according to reductions in carbon intensity emissions per unit of output which adjusts for factors like size other notable news and views from the letter with more widespread remote working jpmorgan may need only seats for every employees this will significantly reduce our need for real estate mr dimon wrote jpmorgan spends more than million a year on cybersecurity mr dimon cited tax loopholes that he thought the united states could do without carried interest tax breaks for racing cars private jets and horse racing and a land conservation tax break for golf courses this was mr dimons longest letter yet at words over pages the steadily expanding letters aside from a shorter edition last year weeks after mr dimon had emergency heart surgery could be seen as a reflection of the range of issues that top executives are now expected or compelled to address
