ally financial inc q3 big auto lenders such as ally financial are enjoying some historic conditions things may not be quite this good in the future but it is too soon to trade in the shares when other lenders are struggling to sustain yield and loan growth ally on tuesday reported records for quarterly revenue and for the number of completed consumer autoloan applications it also had the best credit performance by one key measure in its 102year history when it began as a lending arm of general motors co with a net gain on chargeoffs of percentage points this means that with recovery values so high due to soaring car prices it made money on chargedoff loans yields on auto leases in particular are tremendous right now since the vehicles are worth so much at the end of their terms auto leases generated a yield of in the second quarter up more than percentage points from the first quarter and nearly triple their level a year ago the dilemma now for investors is how to figure out how to normalize from here usedcar price gains will surely start to slow at some point for now autolending stocks are getting somewhat cheap on a forward pricetoearnings basis as their earnings rise even as other stocks baking in better times ahead spendingrelated plays like visa mastercard or american express are trading at relatively high multiples a rapid return to normal might make the relatively expensive stocks look like bargains in retrospect and the cheap ones look pricier still auto lenders such as ally might be better allweather bets for now for example they would continue to benefit from tight supply but also wouldnt necessarily fall off too much if car lots do start to accumulate a bit more inventory when supplychain crunches ease or usedcar demand slows that would boost loan growth to dealers and might even invite more buying by consumers spendingrelated stocks meanwhile wont have as many defensive qualities if the economic recovery is tepid or is slowed by another wave of covid19 infections the worry in auto is that high yields bring in competition and tempt lenders to loosen underwriting terms and lower pricing so far though ally chief executive jeffrey brown said we probably would have expected a little bit more competition than were seeing ally says that it forecasts credit and usedcar price trends to begin to moderate later this year and to keep doing so through it expects typical future lease yields at about half the level where they are now but the company still carries reserves in excess of even more historically typical loss rates and it has more than percentage points of excess capital over its targeted minimum leaving room for capital return it also has been able to gather deposits at a quicker pace since the pandemic began so it is replacing more expensive liabilities with cheap digitalbanking consumer deposits that is enough fuel for shareholders not to worry too much about getting stranded yet
