citigroup inc q4 citigroup has to rip off the bandage south korea move is harder than anticipated it wont be cheap for citigroup to get out of south korean consumer banking that doesnt make it the wrong move earlier this year as part of chief executive jane frasers strategic refresh in pursuit of higher returns the bank said it would exit consumerbanking franchises in markets across asia europe and the middle east on monday citigroup laid out costs for the bank to wind down rather than sell its south korea consumerbanking unit due to costs related to reducing its workforce there the bank said it expects to incur cash costs of about billion to billion it would have been nice to be able to sell the business as the bank anticipates doing in other markets and citigroup shares are underperforming us banks this year but this shouldnt deter investors who are looking to bet on better days ahead once the business is fully wound down a process expected to go through it is expected to free up about billion of tangible common equity this is part of around billion of capital that is anticipated to be freed by the consumerbanking exits that capital can be returned to shareholders or reallocated into core businesses like local transaction banking or wealth management in hubs such as singapore or hong kong and that translates into a higher return on tangible common equity the measure on which many citigroup investors are focused in a way the fact that it isnt cheap to get out of a local retail market reinforces the rationale for the exits retail banking can be a very good business that brings in cheap deposit funding but keeping up with the trend toward digital banking will require big investments including costly downsizing of branches and their workforces that may not ultimately be worth it meanwhile slimming the banks global operations and focusing on its strongest businesses is the desired path forward wealth management in asia can generate big returns but it isnt some pot of easy money many of the worlds largest banks are betting on the regions potential citigroup has its work cut out for it a lot of investors are likely waiting for more strategic benchmarks to be laid out in the banks investor day slated for march before placing any big bets so now is as good a time as any for the bank to do some of the hard parts
