have cards to play in payments jpmorgan chase deal suggests view on travel with people traveling less and spending more on digital platforms banks with big creditcard units have lost some luster with investors but they still have cards to play jpmorgan chase recently acquired the global loyalty division of loyalty group holdings which serves creditcard rewards programs and helps connect them to ways that rewards can be used the move suggests in part that jpmorgan chase sees travel and cards continuing a longrunning association and the deal includes travel services americans may have started using different cards or looking to find other uses for points in lenders have responded by increasing rewards for grocery shopping and streaming but many firms are betting that a pentup desire for escape still exists and spenders soon will be eager to use points again the deal is also notable for coming during the emergence of many technology players in payments and rewards paypal has been beefing up its platform that gives its users ways to use their card points and investing in other inducements to shop such as digital couponclipping service honey meanwhile part of buynowpaylater platform afterpays success is that shoppers can find merchants through afterpay rather than just the other way around the company said this week that referrals to partner merchants this holiday season more than doubled versus the prior year through its shop directory service a risk of this emerging payments ecosystem to card issuers is that they become somewhat secondary to the ecommerce value chain even if people travel again they might be shopping for that travel quite differently by buying a rewards business jpmorgan chase can have a broader role the pandemic has shaken up spending and travel and investors have bet that digital upstarts will be big winners jpmorgan chases deal is a reminder that the card giants wont stay in lockdown data costs tested jpmorgan amazon berkshire venture amazoncom inc jpmorgan chase co and berkshire hathaway inc set out three years ago to join and transform health care instead they struggled to solve even fundamental challenges such as understanding what some kinds of care actually cost haven the joint venture they set up together in to use technology and find new ways to reduce costs for their combined million employees will end operations next month the project cost the three companies roughly million combined people familiar with its budget said from its inception haven faced challenges obtaining data staff turnover fuzzy goals and unexpected competition according to current and former employees and executives at haven and the partner companies those factors doomed the partnership from early on those people said data was a central challenge haven struggled to aggregate and analyze information on healthcare costs for the three companies employees data concerns from the partners and resistance from insurers stymied havens efforts to determine how much the companies paid for medical care and why the people said haven isnt the first venture to struggle with the lack of transparency in healthcare costs and data an issue that has long complicated government reform efforts and technology solutions a new trump administration rule effective this year is supposed to force greater disclosure of the rates negotiated between hospitals and insurers as of jan hospitals are required to publish the prices negotiated privately with each payer for common services for easy use by consumers and make public the same information for all their procedures in a format that can be read and analyzed by computers you cant solve the problem when you cant see it one of the people involved in the venture said we were all doing our own thing and health care was too big a problem for us to solve a haven spokeswoman said the founding companies were committed and engaged from day one through to the decision to end havens operations and will continue to collaborate informally while leaders of the founding companies were initially optimistic about havens potential the challenge of applying its work across three sprawling corporations slowed progress and added complexity the people close to the venture said eventually the companies realized they could implement many projects more efficiently on their own they said despite amazon jpmorgan and berkshires collective size they lacked scale to garner enough negotiating power with care providers to achieve their big aims they would have needed more partner companies to join or cooperation with government said healthcare specialists familiar with havens work they did not have enough bargaining power with the insurance industry or with providers said lyndean brick ceo of healthcare consulting firm advis sweeping changes will take massive governmental and business reform and we have yet to see that cooperation haven which had about employees at its peak took on more projects than staffers said they felt it was equipped to handle much of its work had to be approved by the three founding companies slowing progress atul gawande a writer surgeon and harvard university professor who was tapped to lead haven stepped down in may saying he planned to focus on the covid19 pandemic he didnt respond to requests made to his press office for comment in
