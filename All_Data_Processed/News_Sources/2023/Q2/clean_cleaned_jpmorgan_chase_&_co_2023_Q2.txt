accidental deletion of million electronic messages it was supposed to retain while trying to clear a backlog of communications dating to the jpmorgan inadvertently wiped the messages the sec said in an order published thursday the deletion which took place in violated rules requiring brokers to retain communications for three years the regulator said jpmorgans corporate compliance technology department was working on a project to delete old emails instant messages and bloomberg messages but had difficulty deleting historical communications from the and the sec said during troubleshooting messages from that should have been kept were wiped after an outside provider of archival services gave faulty information about the electronic protections the documents were supposed to have according to the regulator the banks legal discovery team discovered the mixup several months later but the documents couldnt be recovered the sec said jpmorgan takes its recordkeeping obligations seriously a spokeswoman said we have taken steps to enhance our process and procedures the bank which itself reported the incident in didnt admit or deny the allegations according to the order the missing messages hampered regulatory investigations according to the sec in investigations including eight directly involving the sec jpmorgan was unable to produce communications that were sought because they were no longer there the regulator said because the deleted records are unrecoverable it is unknown and unknowable how the lost records may have affected the regulatory investigations the sec said jpmorgan makes one of biggest bets ever on carbon removal the biggest us bank is making one of the biggest bets ever to remove carbon from the atmosphere as a way to fight climate change jpmorgan chase has agreed to invest more than million to purchase credits from several companies in the nascent industry company officials said the money and jpmorgans endorsement are a boost to businesses that have removed only small amounts of carbon so far jpmorgan is making the purchases to neutralize the banks environmental footprint it is also attempting to score new business by becoming a leader in a burgeoning cleanenergy industry the bank helped carbon removal startup climeworks raise million from investors last year and has fielded questions from big corporate clients about carbon removal were jumping in the pool all in brian dimarino jpmorgans head of operational sustainability said in an interview this is us putting our weight and our capital behind something we believe is truly important to bring to market now carbon removal is gaining increasing attention as it becomes clear that the transition away from fossil fuels is moving too slowly to reduce greenhousegas emissions enough to limit climate change scientists estimate billions of tons of removal will be needed annually by midcentury to avoid the worst effects of global warming critics say carbon removal could allow fossilfuel producers to continue with business as usual as the largest us bank jpmorgan is also among the largest financiers of both fossil fuels and clean energy its relationship with oilandgas companies has prompted criticism from climate activists the bank also has been criticized by republicans for giving priority to environmental social and corporate governance or esg factors west virginia banned jpmorgan from doing business with the state last year arguing that esg amounted to a boycott on the states coal industry jpmorgan said the move was disconnected from the facts and antifree market the bank will purchase credits tied to the removal of metric tons of carbon dioxide from several startups including paying more than million to climeworks a swiss company that recently delivered the industrys first verified carbon removals through a process called directair capture which sucks carbon out of the air using giant fans so it can be buried underground climeworks will remove metric tons over nine years getting support from a financial powerhouse is validating after much of the sectors initial support came from technology companies carbonremoval executives said its a big shot in the arm for us to go scale up our operations said peter reinhardt chief executive of startup charm industrial which turns plant waste into a carbonrich liquid that can be injected underground reinhardt said jpmorgans purchases should help charm raise money and reduce costs the company has removed about tons to date jpmorgan is buying nearly tons of removal from charm over five years the bank is also committing to match its operational emissions from directly consuming natural gas and other fuels with equivalent carbon removals by one of the first such pledges by a major company jpmorgan is aiming to reduce those emissions by from levels big companies use a combination of emissions reduction and carbon removal to meet their climate goals carbonremoval companies are attracting billions of dollars in government funding the us is expected to announce the recipients of billion in funding for directair capture hubs around the country this summer climeworks has three applications in for that funding as part of a recent us expansion chief marketing officer julie gosalvez said last years inflation reduction act includes tax credits for directair capture that goldman sachs analysts estimate could cover nearly half the cost of certain projects jpmorgans commitment to fund about tons of removal is the secondlargest purchase in the markets history according to data provider cdrfyi it would neutralize the annual emissions of roughly passenger cars in the sectors largestever deal microsoft said last week it would pay for about million tons of removal through a woodchipfired power station in denmark operated by energy firm orsted when trees and plants grow they naturally absorb carbon capturing that carbon then permanently storing it is one form of carbon removal by agreeing to pay years in advance companies like jpmorgan and microsoft hope to accelerate the industrys growth they are willing to pay hundreds of dollars per ton for each removal credit to get the certainty that they are helping fight climate change they also want to secure the credits they need to hit emissions targets removal credits can cost times more than conventional carbon credits some of which dont benefit the planet jpmorgan will still use some traditional credits dimarino said the bulk of jpmorgans commitment about tons is a preliminary 15year agreement to purchase from co280 a startup the companys removal plans are roughly similar to those of orsted in that it aims to capture carbon absorbed by plants when biomass is used in industrial processes if co280 fails the bank will pay for removal from other companies dimarino said jpmorgans first republic merger adds up financial analysis and commentary investors seem pleased with jpmorgan chases acquisition of first republic with its shares climbing in mondays trading here is how they may be thinking about the numbers behind the deal the deal with the federal deposit insurance corp is complex but it boils down to this jpmorgan gets billion worth of assets including securities and loans this is money due to the bank it took on billion worth of deposits federal home loan bank advances and some other liabilities this is money the bank owes to others the difference between those two numbers is basically the available potential value of the deal to jpmorgan however that is whittled down in a number of ways for one jpmorgan says the assets are worth billion today thanks to marktomarket adjustments for things like movements in interest rates on the liability side jpmorgan will get billion in financing from the fdic for five years that adds to its debts even though it gets to wipe away the billion in its own money deposited at first republic jpmorgan also will pay billion to the fdic as part of the deal taxes take out a big chunk after that after some other possible adjustments the end result is a gain of billion for jpmorgan that gain in turn will be eroded by what jpmorgan expects to be about billion in restructuring costs over the next two years as it figures out how to integrate first republics employees branches and technology after all is said and done what will remain is what jpmorgan estimates will be roughly million in ongoing annual net income from first republics business the ultimate benefit to the banks return on equity a key metric tracked by investors is a bit more complex the question there is how much equity capital jpmorgan must retain against the added assets banks are subject to regulatory capital requirements based on a risk weighting of their assets here jpmorgans losssharing agreement with the fdic is crucial with the fdic agreement to cover of losses on singlefamily residential mortgages and commercial loans for seven years and five years respectively jpmorgan says it will be able to give an overall risk weighting of about to the assumed assets so jpmorgans socalled common equity tier capital ratio will only go down by percentage point as a result of the deal from the banks estimate of for the first quarter of that is in line with its target suggesting the bank wont need to hold off on buybacks to accommodate this deal of course there may be other less quantifiable costs or benefits to jpmorgan one key question is whether it will be able to turn the acquired customers into lucrative wealth management relationships for now investors have good reasons to expect the deal to benefit jpmorgan jpmorgans epstein ties were deeper than bank has said jpmorgan chase co had ties to jeffrey epstein that ran deeper than the bank has acknowledged and extended years beyond when it decided to close the convicted sex offenders accounts according to people familiar with the matter mary erdoes a top lieutenant to chief executive jamie dimon made two trips to epsteins townhouse on manhattans upper east side in and when epstein still was a client of the bank said the people familiar with the matter she exchanged dozens of emails with him and discussed sharing with him fees related to a charitable fund the bank was considering launching the people said john duffy who ran jpmorgans us private bank for the ultrarich went to epsteins townhouse for a meeting in april the people said one month later the private bank renewed an authorization allowing epstein to borrow money against his accounts despite repeated warnings from compliance staffers about his unusual banking practices justin nelson one of epsteins bankers at jpmorgan had about a halfdozen meetings at epsteins townhouse between and the people said he also traveled to epsteins ranch in new mexico in the people said jpmorgan has said it closed epsteins accounts in ms erdoes has previously said through a jpmorgan spokesman that the only time she remembered meeting epstein was the day she fired him as a client of jpmorgans private bank ms erdoes declined to comment for this article epstein was convicted of soliciting a minor for prostitution in and forced to register as a sex offender he was arrested in accused of orchestrating a scheme to traffic and sexually abuse girls the bank has denied knowing about epsteins crimes and has sued one of its former executives jes staley accusing him of misleading the bank about epsteins character and conduct mr staleys lawyers have said the allegations against him are baseless the new details show that jpmorgan was treating epstein like a star client after his first conviction and despite repeated warnings from its own employees and after jpmorgan closed epsteins accounts bankers kept meeting with him for years a jpmorgan spokesman said the level of interaction with epstein wasnt atypical for a client of a private bank any meeting held with epstein after the spokesman said was regarding other jpmorgan bank clients whom epstein represented mr nelson declined to comment the spokesman said mr duffy who no longer works at the bank didnt respond to requests for comment a pair of lawsuits filed against jpmorgan late last year in federal court in manhattan have drawn fresh attention to the banks ties to epstein who died in in new york jail of what the citys medical examiner said was a suicide at the time he was awaiting trial on sextrafficking charges
