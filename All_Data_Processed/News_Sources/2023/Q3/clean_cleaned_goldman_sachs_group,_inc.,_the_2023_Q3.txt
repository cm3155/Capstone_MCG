goldman sachs group inc the q3 struggling goldman reports a steep drop in quarterly profit goldman sachs on wednesday reported quarterly profit that fell short of even dampened expectations another reminder of the troubles facing one of wall streets premier names the investment bank which has spent much of this year unwinding mistakes of years past reported a profit half as large as that of its rival morgan stanley to say nothing of larger lenders at goldman the pain was distributed across the board in its investment bank sputtering consumer arm slowing trading operations and commercial real estate portfolio david solomon the banks chief executive called it obviously a tough quarter perhaps in an indication of how low analyst projections had been shares rose nearly percent on wednesday the numbers goldman sachs reported a profit of billion in the second quarter down more than percent from a year earlier the bank highlighted writedowns in the value of its commercial real estate portfolio a billion hit to profit and the buynowpaylater firm greensky which subtracted nearly million from its earnings goldman acquired greensky less than two years ago as part of an illfated foray into consumer lending quarterly revenue at billion was percent lower than it was a year earlier the bank employed people at the end of june down from a year earlier goldman has gone through at least three rounds of layoffs this year taking head count down percent so far this year takeaways this seems to have been a ripthebandaidoff quarter for goldman the real estate writedown in particular appeared to pack potential losses into the period there are however good reasons for the move remote or hybrid work appears here to stay and that has bleak implications for office space and landlords in many cities having already conceded some losses in that area goldman can now shift attention to other areas of the business like investment banking which tends to ebb and flow it definitely feels better over the course of the last six to eight weeks than it felt earlier in the year mr solomon said context the big question for mr solomon is whether he can convince investors and many inside his own firm of a return to the muchfeared goldman of yore the bank is nearly a year into an extended apologia for its consumer woes which at one point included marcus a consumer division named after the companys founder creditcard offerings and savings accounts aimed at the mass market the bank said this year that it had lost more than billion tied to those efforts since december the bank is still unwinding most of the business at a loss and it may expect more ugly headlines until that is finished whats next unlike more diversified lenders like jpmorgan chase goldman relies heavily on its wall street franchise and corporate activity has been muted in the face of economic uncertainty rising interest rates and the like that means that if there is a prolonged chill in dealmaking there may be little that the bank can do to fully insulate itself goldman seeks a way out of venture with apple goldman sachs group is trying to end its partnership with apple the wall street firm is in talks with american express to take over its apple credit card and other ventures with the tech giant according to people familiar with the matter goldman went public with plans to scale back its consumer business late last year but it appeared committed to the apple relationship the bank recently extended the partnership through the end of the decade agreed to support apples buy now pay later offering and launched a bank account with the tech company now it is in talks to offload those businesses and its creditcard partnership to amex according to people familiar with the discussions goldman has also discussed transferring its card partnership with general motors to amex or another issuer some of the people said a deal with amex isnt imminent or assured people familiar with the conversations said and it could take a while to transfer the partnership in any case apple would have to agree to a transfer the tech company is aware of the talks which have been ongoing for months the people said a retreat from apple and credit cards would effectively end goldmans consumerlending business the bank has already stopped issuing personal loans and it is trying to sell greensky the homeimprovement lender it bought just last year exiting the apple partnership would also seal the fate of goldmans grand plans to become a fullservice bank goldman a firm best known for dominating the wall street businesses of investment banking and trading first made a play for main street with its marcus highyield savings account in three years later it expanded into credit cards with its splashy apple partnership goldman reached a deal for greensky in late and closed on the purchase early last year goldman quickly became a presence in the bidding wars for cobranded creditcard deals long the territory of megabanks like jpmorgan chase and citigroup that have giant consumer arms that changed when goldman decided to scale back its consumer ambitions late last year following an internal review goldman ended talks with tmobile to launch a credit card and stepped away from bidding on new programs the wall street journal reported in february a few months later goldman said it would look for a buyer for greensky still goldman stayed close to apple on a call with analysts in october chief executive david solomon talked up the relationship after announcing the banks broader retreat from fullservice consumer banking its a very very strong partnership where theres a lot of opportunity solomon said at the time the bank launched a savings account with apple in april solomon has fielded a lot of internal criticism for presiding over the costly consumer foray in january goldman disclosed that it had lost about billion on the consumerlending push since should goldman get out of the creditcard business and sell greensky its consumer business would be reduced to its original product the marcus savings account the bank has said it has no plans to stop taking consumer deposits
