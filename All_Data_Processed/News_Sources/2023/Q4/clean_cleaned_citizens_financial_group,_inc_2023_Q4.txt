higherrate world the bank is however considering bringing back the freshbaked chocolatechip cookies and highend umbrellas that first republic was known for citizens has hired about top first republic bankers and about support staffers the bankers were largely in roles where they were the main point of contact for customers customers would call them up if they needed yen delivered before a trip to japan or a bespoke mortgage for a new vacation home these staffers were largely paid based off the business they generated and could earn seven figures in a good year the new hires are huntergatherers

areas where the failed banks did a lot of business are a big focus eric bahn cofounder of a venturecapital firm in the bay area loved that he could text his first republic bankers and turn to them to sponsor events his firm held for startups his bankers went to citizens and they persuaded bahn to switch over last month he is happy with his new bank accounts and commercial lines of credit and says the service is great his one gripe the technology its probably one of the roughest bank websites ive ever seen bahn said citizens said the new hires brought in more than million in deposits and investments before the private banks october launch it says the unit will boost the banks earnings starting next year citizens will offer big customers discounted rates but doesnt plan to undercut the market by as much as first republic did executives also said the first republicstyle business is less risky as a small part of a more diversified bank alexis jeffries a product strategist professor and angel investor in los angeles said she would consider moving some of her first republic accounts to a bank like citizens if it offered good service and competitive rates but she wont be in the market for a mortgage soon the one she got with first republic in has a rate of short of pulling a rabbit out of their hat and giving me a lower rate she said i dont see that happening
