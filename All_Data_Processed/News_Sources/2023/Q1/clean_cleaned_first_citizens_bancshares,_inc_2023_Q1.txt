signature bank and a dramatic intervention by financial regulators aimed at easing fears that depositors would flee smaller lenders the sale represents a milestone in regulatory efforts to clean up after two of the largest bank failures in history at a time when investors are on edge about the health of the global financial system lawmakers are set to begin two days of hearings on the failures

republic bank pacwest bancorp and westernalliance bancorp were also higher first citizens based in raleigh nc was the 30thlargest us bank as of dec with billion in assets according to the federal reserve mondays deal puts the lender in the top us banks in terms of assets the fdic agreed to share any of first citizens losses or potential gains on svbs commercial loans overall the fdic estimated the failure of svb will cost a federal insurance fund it oversees about billion or roughly of the banks assets before its failure we look forward to building relationships with our new customers and positioning our company for continued success as we affirm our commitment to support the integrity of our nations banking system first citizens chief executive frank holding jr said in a news release the bank has at least one thing going for it it knows its way around troubled banks during the financial crisis of when lenders were failing left and right it took on the deposits of temecula valley bank in california and venture bank in washington it did the same for sun american bank in florida and united western bank in colorado the svb deal is its 22nd with federal agencies according to janney montgomery scott llc they were a frequent bidder during the financial crisis said john popeo a lawyer who helped sell failed banks for the fdic at the time and is now a partner at advisory firm the gallatin group i recall them having a pretty good reputation first citizens isnt known for technology banking the breadandbutter business of svb but its headquarters are at the center of a regional tech hub the bank has expanded rapidly in recent years particularly in commercial banking the svb purchase will give it a banking presence in california and a wealthmanagement business in the northeast on top of the losssharing agreement the fdic will help finance the deal with a fiveyear billion loan the agency also is providing a billion line of credit to help cover potential deposit flight it looks to me like a pretty substantial support network around this transaction said alexander rolfe a former fdic official who is now a consultant that could set a precedent for future deals he said banking regulators which announced the deal late sunday had been looking for a buyer since seizing control of the failed bank first citizens bancshares a familyrun bank in north carolina that traces its history to the late said on sunday that it would acquire silicon valley bank the california lender founded in the at the center of the technology industry whose rapid growth and sudden collapse this month sent shock waves across the financial sector the federal deposit insurance corporation seized control of silicon valley bank on march after a run on deposits left it insolvent making it the countrys largest bank failure since the financial crisis the fdic had since been looking for a buyer for the bank which was the countrys 16th largest when it collapsed the deal for the bank renamed silicon valley bridge bank after the fdic seized it included the purchase of about billion in loans at a discount of billion and the transfer of all the banks deposits worth billion roughly billion in silicon valley banks securities and other assets were not included in the sale and remained in the fdics control the discount applied to the loans could help set a benchmark for other banks seeking investment said mark jeffrey flannery a professor of finance at the university of florida now they have an idea he said yes its bad but its not a complete train wreck its just very bad silicon valley bank had roughly billion in deposits before its collapse an illustration of how extensive the withdrawals were before regulators seized it a test for first citizens is whether it can maintain relationships with the techheavy client base that silicon valley bank cultivated perhaps the silicon valley vc dudes feel theyre too cool for a north carolina bank wrote analysts at autonomous research who said they had been fielding questions from investors about the logic of the deal admittedly there has been a strong amount of runoff from the legacy silicon valley bank this quarter craig nix the chief financial officer of first citizens said on a call with investors on monday however it is our intent to embrace the talents of our legacy svb employees embrace their business capabilities and then reiterate to their clients that first citizens has an unwavering focus on holistic client relationships as part of the deal the fdic will receive rights linked to the stock of first citizens which could be worth up to million the bank regulator estimated that the cost of silicon valley banks failure on the governments deposit insurance fund would be billion first citizens and the fdic will share any losses on the loans included in the transaction an arrangement that is often featured in sales of failed banks for example the fdic agreed to reimburse first citizens for half of any losses above billion on the portfolio of commercial loans transferred in the deal silicon valley banks former branches in california and massachusetts opened under ownership of the first citizens umbrella on monday silicon valley banks former parent company svb financial filed for bankruptcy on march it plans to run a separate process to sell various units including the
