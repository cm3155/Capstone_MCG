highestspending cardholders to bring guests announced more than a year ago is designed to ensure a great experience as travel booms the company is also adding and renovating lounges with an expanded lounge in seattle making its debut last week we want to be there for our cardmembers when they decide to visit us he says whether ending guest freebies will ease crowding at the centurion lounges is

that bring multiple guests he says in phoenix where the centurion lounge is adjacent to an escape lounge also open to american express platinum cardholders a centurion employee told me crowds have been noticeably lighter because free guests are still allowed next door some travelers interpret american expresss new guest policy as aimed at reducing the number of families in lounges especially during spring break summer and other busy travel periods mr rivero says no one is being denied access under the new policy and noted that the lounges lowered the guest fee for children as part of the policy switch previously someone bringing in more than two guests paid per person regardless of age that was lowered to for children he says todd kagler has shelled out hundreds of dollars a year for

down this month to determine whether the card is worth it mr kagler vacations frequently with his grandchildren and books flights with connections in cities with a centurion lounge he says on a big family trip to mexico in december they brought five grandchildren ages to for free into the centurion lounge in dallas under the old platinum card guest policy his wife and son are authorized users on the account so the three of them were each allowed two guests he says he decided to stick with the platinum card after tallying up the other travel benefits he uses but his grandchildren wont be joining him in the lounge en masse anymore if its just one kid with us i probably would do it he says ms davidson who manages a service division for a contracting company in vancouver british columbia says her sons lounge days are history they enjoyed french toast muffins fruit apple juice and time on their ipads in the phoenix centurion lounge earlier this month but the is too steep given cheaper options elsewhere at the airport she thinks young children should be admitted free to the lounges i will definitely reconsider this card she says as i feel this is absurd
