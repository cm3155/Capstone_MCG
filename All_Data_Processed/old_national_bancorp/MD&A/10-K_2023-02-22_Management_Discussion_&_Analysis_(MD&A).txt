company provides nongaap performance results which the company believes are useful because they assist investors in assessing the companys operating performance where nongaap financial measures are used the comparable gaap financial measure as well as the reconciliation to the comparable gaap financial measure can be found in the following table the taxable equivalent adjustment to net interest income and net interest margin recognizes the income tax savings when comparing taxable and taxexempt assets interest income and yields on taxexempt securities and loans are presented using the current federal income tax rate of management believes that it is standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest income and net interest margin on a fully taxequivalent basis and that it may enhance comparability for peer comparison purposes in managements view tangible common equity measures are capital adequacy metrics that may be meaningful to the company as well as analysts and investors in assessing the companys use of equity and in facilitating comparisons with peers these nongaap measures are valuable indicators of a financial institutions capital strength since they eliminate intangible assets from shareholders equity and retain the effect of aoci in shareholders equity although intended to enhance investors understanding of the companys business and performance these nongaap financial measures should not be considered an alternative to gaap in addition these nongaap financial measures may differ from those used by other financial institutions to

this metric enhances comparability for peer comparison purposes comparison of fiscal years and net interest income net interest income is the most significant component of our earnings comprising of revenues net interest income and net interest margin are influenced by many factors primarily the volume and mix of earning assets funding sources and interest rate fluctuations other factors include the level of accretion income on purchased loans prepayment risk on mortgage and investmentrelated assets and the composition and maturity of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities interest rates increased significantly during the federal reserves federal funds range is currently in a target range of to with the effective federal funds rate at at december the federal reserve is expected to continue to increase the federal funds rate into management actively takes balance sheet restructuring derivative and deposit pricing actions to help mitigate interest rate risk see the section of this item titled market risk for additional information regarding this risk loans typically generate more interest income than investment securities with similar maturities funding from client deposits generally costs less than wholesale funding sources factors such as general economic activity federal reserve monetary policy and price volatility of competing alternative investments can also exert significant influence on our ability to optimize our mix of assets and funding net interest income and net interest margin net interest income is the excess of interest received from interestearning assets over interest paid on interestbearing liabilities for analytical purposes net interest income is presented in the table that follows adjusted to a taxable equivalent basis to reflect what our taxexempt assets would need to yield in order to achieve the same aftertax yield as a taxable asset we used the federal statutory tax rate in effect of for all periods this analysis portrays the income tax benefits related to taxexempt assets and helps to facilitate a comparison between taxable and taxexempt assets management believes that it is a standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest margin and net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis therefore management believes these measures provide useful information for both management and

future which arise due to timing differences in the recognition of certain items for financial statement and income tax purposes the major difference between the effective tax rate applied to our

million at december lending activities commercial commercial and industrial loans are made primarily for the purpose of financing equipment acquisition expansion working capital and other general business purposes lease financing consists of direct financing leases and is used by commercial clients to finance capital purchases ranging from computer equipment to transportation equipment the credit decisions for these transactions are based upon an assessment of the overall financial capacity of the applicant a determination is made as to the applicants ability to repay in accordance with the proposed terms as well as an overall assessment of the risks involved in addition to an evaluation of the applicants financial condition a determination is made of the probable adequacy of the primary and secondary sources of repayment such as additional collateral or personal guarantees to be relied upon in the transaction credit agency reports of the applicants credit history supplement the analysis of the applicants creditworthiness commercial mortgages and construction loans are offered to real estate investors developers and builders primarily domiciled in the geographic midwest market areas we serve these loans are secured by first mortgages on real estate at ltv margins deemed appropriate for the property type quality location and sponsorship generally these ltv ratios do not exceed the commercial properties are predominantly multifamily and nonresidential properties such as retail centers industrial properties as well as to a lesser extent more specialized properties substantially all of our commercial real estate loans are secured by properties located in our primary market area in the underwriting of our commercial real estate loans we obtain appraisals for the underlying properties decisions to lend are based on the economic viability of the property and the creditworthiness of the borrower in evaluating a proposed commercial real estate loan we primarily emphasize the ratio of the propertys projected net cash flows to the loans debt service requirement the debt service coverage ratio normally is not less than and it is computed after deduction for a vacancy factor and property expenses as appropriate in addition a personal guarantee of the loan or a portion thereof is often required from the principals of the borrower in most cases we require title insurance insuring the priority of our lien fire and extended coverage casualty insurance and flood insurance if appropriate in order to protect our security interest in the underlying property in addition business interruption insurance or other insurance may be required construction loans are underwritten against projected cash flows derived from rental income business income from an owneroccupant or the sale of the property to an enduser we may mitigate the risks associated with these types of loans by requiring fixedprice construction contracts performance and payment bonding controlled disbursements and presale contracts or prelease agreements consumer we offer a variety of first mortgage and junior lien loans to consumers within our markets with residential home mortgages comprising our largest consumer loan category these loans are secured by a primary residence and are underwritten using traditional underwriting systems to assess the credit risks of the consumer decisions are primarily based on ltv ratios dti ratios liquidity and credit scores a maximum ltv ratio of is generally required although higher levels are permitted with mortgage insurance or other mitigating factors we offer fixed rate mortgages and variable rate mortgages with interest rates that are subject to change every year after the first third fifth or seventh year depending on the product and are based on indexed rates such as prime we do not offer paymentoption facilities subprime loans or any product with negative amortization home equity loans are secured primarily by second mortgages on residential property of the borrower the underwriting terms for the home equity product generally permit borrowing availability in the aggregate up to of the appraised value of the collateral property at the time of origination we offer fixed and variable rate home equity loans with variable rate loans underwritten at fullyindexed rates decisions are primarily based on ltv ratios dti ratios and credit scores we do not offer home equity loan products with reduced documentation automobile loans include loans and leases secured by new or used automobiles we originate automobile loans and leases primarily on an indirect basis through selected dealerships we require borrowers to maintain collision insurance on automobiles securing consumer loans with us listed as loss payee our procedures for underwriting automobile loans include an assessment of an applicants overall financial capacity including credit history and the ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan although an applicants creditworthiness is the primary consideration the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral security to the proposed loan amount asset quality communitybased lending personnel along with regionbased independent underwriting and analytic support staff extend credit under guidelines established and

additional information on tdrs allowance for credit losses on loans and unfunded loan commitments credit quality within the loans held for investment portfolio is continuously monitored by management and is reflected within the allowance for credit losses on loans the allowance for credit losses is an estimate of expected losses inherent within the companys loans held for investment portfolio credit quality is assessed and monitored by evaluating various attributes and the results of those evaluations are utilized in underwriting new loans and in our process for estimating expected credit losses expected credit loss inherent in noncancelable offbalancesheet credit exposures is accounted for as a separate liability included in other liabilities on the balance sheet the allowance for credit losses on loans held for investment and unfunded loan commitments is adjusted by a credit loss expense which is reported in earnings and reduced by the chargeoff of loan amounts net of recoveries accrued interest receivable is excluded from the estimate of credit losses the allowance for credit loss estimation process involves procedures to consider the unique characteristics of our loan portfolio segments these segments are further disaggregated into loan classes based on the level at which credit risk of the loan is monitored when computing the level of expected credit losses credit loss assumptions are estimated using a model that categorizes loan pools based on loss history delinquency status and other credit trends and risk characteristics including current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain in future periods evaluations of the overall loan portfolio in light of the factors and forecasts then prevailing may result in significant changes in the allowance and credit loss expense in those future periods the allowance level is influenced by loan volumes loan aqr migration or delinquency status changes in historical loss experience and other conditions influencing loss expectations such as reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions the methodology for estimating the amount of expected credit losses reported in the allowance for credit losses on loans has two basic components first an assetspecific component involving individual loans that do not share risk characteristics with other loans and the measurement of expected credit losses for such individual loans and second a pooled component for estimated expected credit losses for pools of loans that share similar risk characteristics the loan categories used to monitor and analyze interest income and yields are different than the portfolio segments used to determine the allowance for credit losses on loans the allowance for credit losses on loans was calculated by pooling loans of similar credit risk characteristics and credit monitoring procedures the four loan portfolios used to monitor and analyze interest income and yields commercial commercial real estate residential real estate and consumer are reclassified into seven segments of loans commercial commercial real estate bbcc residential real estate indirect direct and home equity for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses on loans the commercial and commercial real estate loan categories shown on the balance sheet include the same pool of loans as the commercial commercial real estate and

commercial commercial real estate bbcc residential real estate indirect direct home equity total table end we maintain an allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments to provide for the risk of loss inherent in these arrangements the allowance is computed using a methodology similar to that used to determine the allowance for credit losses on loans modified to take into account the probability of a drawdown on the commitment the allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments is classified as a liability account on the balance sheet within accrued expenses and other liabilities while the corresponding provision for unfunded loan commitments is included in the provision for credit losses the allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments totaled million at december compared to million at december the increase in the allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments was driven by the merger with first midwest as well as organic loan growth market risk market risk is the risk that the estimated fair value of our assets liabilities and derivative financial instruments will decline as a result of changes in interest rates or financial market volatility or that our net income will be significantly reduced by interest rate changes the objective of our interest rate management process is to maximize net interest income while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity potential cash flows sales or replacement value of many of our assets and liabilities especially those that earn or pay interest are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates this interest rate risk arises primarily from our normal business activities of gathering deposits and extending loans many factors affect our exposure to changes in interest rates such as general economic and financial conditions client preferences historical pricing relationships and repricing characteristics of financial instruments our earnings can also be affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of the us government and its agencies particularly the federal reserve in managing interest rate risk we establish guidelines for asset and liability management including measurement of short and longterm sensitivities to changes in interest rates which are reviewed with the enterprise risk committee of our board of directors based on the results of our analysis we may use different techniques to manage changing trends in interest rates including adjusting balance sheet mix or altering interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities changing product pricing strategies modifying characteristics of the investment securities portfolio or using derivative financial instruments to a limited degree a key element in our ongoing process is to measure and monitor interest rate risk using a model to quantify the likely impact of changing interest rates on old nationals results of operations the model quantifies the effects of various possible interest rate scenarios on projected net interest income the model measures the impact on net interest income relative to a base case scenario the base case scenario assumes that the balance sheet and interest rates are held at current levels the model shows our projected net interest income sensitivity based on interest rate changes only and does not consider other forecast assumptions the following table illustrates our projected net interest income sensitivity over a twoyear cumulative horizon based on the assetliability model as of december and table start immediate rate decrease immediate rate increase dollars in thousands basis points basis points base basis points basis points

interest income money market other interest earning investments and investment securities loans total interest income projected interest expense deposits borrowings total interest expense net interest income change from base change from base table end our projected net interest income increased year over year due to the first midwest merger loan growth and rising interest rates a key element in the measurement and modeling of interest rate risk is the repricing assumptions of our transaction deposit accounts which have no contractual maturity dates because the models are driven by expected behavior in various interest rate scenarios and many factors besides market interest rates affect our net interest income we recognize that model outputs are not guarantees of actual results for this reason we model many different combinations of interest rates and balance sheet assumptions to understand our overall sensitivity to market interest rate changes including shocks ramps yield curve flattening yield curve steepening as well as forecasts of likely interest rate scenarios tested we use cash flow and fair value hedges primarily interest rate swaps collars and floors to mitigate interest rate risk derivatives designated as hedging instruments were in a net liability position with a fair value loss of million at december compared to a net asset position with a fair value gain of million at december see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivative financial instruments liquidity risk liquidity risk arises from the possibility that we may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments or may become unduly reliant on alternative funding sources we establish liquidity risk guidelines that we review with the enterprise risk committee of our board of directors and monitor through our balance sheet management committee the objective of liquidity management is to ensure we have the ability to fund balance sheet growth and meet deposit and debt obligations in a timely and costeffective manner management monitors liquidity through a regular review of asset and liability maturities funding sources and loan and deposit forecasts we maintain strategic and contingency liquidity plans to ensure sufficient available funding to satisfy requirements for balance sheet growth properly manage capital markets funding sources and to address unexpected liquidity requirements on june we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the sec that permits us to issue an unspecified amount of debt or equity securities loan repayments and maturing investment securities are a relatively predictable source of funds however deposit flows calls of investment securities and prepayments of loans and mortgagerelated securities are not as predictable as they are strongly influenced by interest rates the housing market general and local economic conditions and competition in the marketplace we continually monitor

discussion of income taxes and liabilities is included in note to the consolidated financial statements critical accounting estimates our most significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements certain of these accounting policies require management to use significant judgment and estimates which can have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities we consider these policies to be our critical accounting estimates the judgment and assumptions made are based upon historical experience future forecasts or other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances because of the nature of the judgment and assumptions actual results could differ from estimates which could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations the following accounting policies materially affect our reported earnings and financial condition and require significant judgments and estimates management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with our audit committee business combinations and goodwill description for mergers and acquisitions we are required to record the assets acquired including identified intangible assets such as core deposit and customer trust relationship intangibles and the liabilities assumed at their fair value the difference between consideration and the net fair value of assets acquired is recorded as goodwill management uses significant estimates and assumptions to value such items including projected cash flows repayment rates default rates and losses assuming default discount rates and realizable collateral values the allowance for credit losses for pcd loans is recognized within acquisition accounting the allowance for credit losses for nonpcd assets is recognized as provision for credit losses in the same reporting period as the merger or acquisition fair value adjustments are amortized or accreted into the income statement over the estimated life of the acquired assets or assumed liabilities the purchase date valuations and any subsequent adjustments determine the amount of goodwill recognized in connection with the merger or acquisition the use of different assumptions could produce significantly different valuation results which could have material positive or negative effects on our results of operations the carrying value of goodwill recorded must be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis as well as on an interim basis if events or changes indicate that the asset might be impaired an impairment loss must be recognized for any excess of carrying value over fair value of the goodwill judgments and uncertainties the determination of fair values is based on valuations using managements assumptions of future growth rates future attrition discount rates multiples of earnings or other relevant factors in addition we engage third party specialists to assist in the development of fair values preliminary estimates of fair values may be adjusted for a period of time subsequent to the merger or acquisition date if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the merger or acquisition date that if known would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date adjustments recorded during this period are recognized in the current reporting period management uses various valuation methodologies to estimate the fair value of these assets and liabilities and often involves a significant degree of judgment particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the particular item being valued examples of such items include loans deposits identifiable intangible assets and certain other assets and liabilities effect if actual results differ from assumptions changes in these factors as well as downturns in economic or business conditions could have a significant adverse impact on the carrying value of assets including goodwill and liabilities which could result in impairment losses affecting our financial statements as a whole and our banking subsidiary in which the goodwill resides pandemic a prolonged covid19 pandemic or any other epidemic that harms the global economy us economy or the economies in which we operate could adversely affect our operations goodwill is especially susceptible to risk of impairment during prolonged periods of economic downturn allowance for credit losses on loans description the allowance for credit losses on loans represents managements estimate of all expected credit losses over the expected contractual life of our loan portfolio determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain subsequent evaluations of the thenexisting loan portfolio in light of the factors then prevailing may result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses in those future periods the allowance for credit losses on loans as reported in our consolidated statements of financial condition is adjusted by an expense for credit losses which is recognized in earnings and reduced by the chargeoff of loan amounts net of recoveries judgments and uncertainties we utilize a discounted cashflow approach to determine the allowance for credit losses for performing loans and nonperforming loans expected cashflows are created for each loan and discounted using the effective yield method the discounted sum of expected cashflows is then compared to the amortized cost and any shortfall is recorded as an allowance expected cashflows are created using a combination of contractual payment schedules calculated pds lgd and prepayment assumptions as well as qualitative factors for commercial and commercial real estate loans the pd is forecasted using a regression model to determine the likelihood of a loan moving into nonaccrual within the time horizon for residential and consumer loans the pd is forecasted using a regression model to determine the likelihood of a loan being chargedoff within the time horizon the regression models use combinations of variables to assess systematic and unsystematic risk variables used for unsystematic risk are borrower specific and help to gauge the risk of default from an individual borrower variables for systematic risk risk inherent to all borrowers come from the use of forwardlooking economic forecasts and include variables such as unemployment rate gross domestic product and house price index the lgd is defined as credit loss incurred when an obligor of the bank defaults qualitative factors include items such as changes in lending policies or procedures and economic uncertainty in forwardlooking forecasts effect if actual results differ from assumptions the allowance represents managements best estimate but significant downturns in circumstances relating to loan quality and economic conditions could result in a requirement for additional allowance likewise an upturn in loan quality and improved economic conditions may allow a reduction in the required allowance in either instance unanticipated changes could have a significant impact on results of operations one of the most significant judgments used in determining the allowance for credit losses is the macroeconomic forecast provided by a third party the economic indices sourced from the macroeconomic forecast and used in projecting loss rates include the national unemployment rate changes in commercial real estate prices changes in home values and changes in the united states gross domestic product the economic index used in the calculation to which the calculation may be most sensitive is the national unemployment rate each reporting period several macroeconomic forecast scenarios are considered by management management selects the macroeconomic forecast that is most reflective of expectations at that point in time changes in the macroeconomic forecast especially for the national unemployment rate could significantly impact the calculated estimated credit losses the expense for credit loss recorded through earnings is the amount necessary to maintain the allowance for credit losses at the amount of expected credit losses inherent within the loans held for investment portfolio the amount of expense and the corresponding level of allowance for credit losses on loans are based on our evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio based on historical loss experience reasonable and supportable forecasts and other significant qualitative and quantitative factors derivative financial instruments description as part of our overall interest rate risk management we use derivative instruments to reduce exposure to changes in interest rates and market prices for financial instruments the application of the hedge accounting policy requires judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness identification of similar hedged item groupings and measurement of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments and hedged items to the extent hedging relationships are found to be effective changes in fair value of the derivatives are offset by changes in the fair value of the related hedged item or recorded to other comprehensive income loss management believes hedge effectiveness is evaluated properly in preparation of the financial statements all of the derivative financial instruments we use have an active market and indications of fair value can be readily obtained we are not using the shortcut method of accounting for any fair value derivatives credit risk arises from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts old nationals exposure is limited to the termination value of the contracts rather than the notional principal or contract amounts there are provisions in our agreements with the counterparties that allow for certain unsecured credit exposure up to an agreed threshold exposures in excess of the agreed thresholds are collateralized in addition we minimize credit risk through credit approvals limits and monitoring procedures judgments and uncertainties the application of the hedge accounting policy requires judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness identification of similar hedged item groupings and measurement of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments and hedged items effect if actual results differ from assumptions to the extent hedging relationships are found to be effective changes in fair value of the derivatives are offset by changes in the fair value of the related hedged item or recorded to other comprehensive income loss however if in the future the derivative financial instruments used by us no longer qualify for hedge accounting treatment all changes in fair value of the derivative would flow through the consolidated statements of income in other noninterest income resulting in greater volatility in our earnings income taxes description we are subject to the income tax laws of the us its states and the municipalities in which we operate these tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant government taxing authorities we review income tax expense and the carrying value of deferred tax assets quarterly and as new information becomes available the balances are adjusted as appropriate fasb asc fin prescribes a recognition threshold of morelikelythannot and a measurement attribute for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return in order for those tax positions to be recognized in the financial statements see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of our provision and related income tax assets and liabilities judgments and uncertainties in establishing a provision for income tax expense we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws we must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be subject to reviewadjudication by the court systems of the various tax jurisdictions or may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit effect if actual results differ from assumptions although management believes that the judgments and estimates used are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material to the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected an unfavorable tax settlement would result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution a favorable tax settlement would result in a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to it in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
