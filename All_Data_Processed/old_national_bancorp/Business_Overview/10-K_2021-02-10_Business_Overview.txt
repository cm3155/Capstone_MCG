and consistent quality earnings targeted geographic markets for acquisitions include midsize markets with average to above average growth rates we anticipate that as with previous acquisitions the consideration paid by us in future acquisitions may be in the form of cash debt or old national stock or a combination thereof the amount and structure of such consideration is based on reasonable growth and cost savings assumptions and a thorough analysis of the impact on both long and shortterm financial results our most recent acquisitions included the following anchor bancorp wisconsin inc

capital relief related to impact of cecl concurrent with enactment of the cares act in march the occ the board of governors of the federal reserve system and the fdic published an interim final rule

announced revisions to the volcker rule that will simplify and streamline compliance requirements for old national bank bank holding company regulation old national is registered as a bank holding company and has elected to be a financial holding company it is subject to the supervision of and regulation by the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve under the bank holding company act of as amended the bhc act the federal reserve has issued regulations under the bhc act requiring a bank holding company to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks it is the policy of the federal reserve that pursuant to this requirement a bank holding company should stand ready to use its resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity under this requirement old national is expected to commit resources to support old national bank including at times when old national may not be in a financial position to provide such resources any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks in the event of a bank holding companys bankruptcy any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment the bhc act requires the prior approval of the federal reserve before a bank holding company can acquire more than a voting interest of any bank or bank holding company additionally the bhc act restricts old nationals nonbanking activities to those which are determined by the federal reserve to be closely related to banking and a proper incident thereto as well as those that are permissible for a financial holding company under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia a bank holding company is required to guarantee the compliance of any insured depository institution subsidiary that may become undercapitalized as defined in fdicia with the terms of any capital restoration plan filed by such subsidiary with its appropriate federal bank regulatory agency capital and liquidity requirements bank holding companies are required to comply with the federal reserves riskbased capital guidelines the fdic and the occ have adopted riskbased capital ratio guidelines to which depository institutions under their respective supervision including old national bank are subject the guidelines establish a systematic analytical framework that makes regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banking organizations riskbased capital ratios are determined by allocating assets and specified offbalance sheet commitments to four riskweighted categories with higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as representing greater risk old national bank exceeded all riskbased minimum capital requirements of the fdic and occ as of december and for old nationals regulatory capital ratios and regulatory requirements as of december and see note to the consolidated financial statements the federal regulatory authorities current riskbased capital guidelines are based upon the basel committee on banking supervision the basel committee the basel committee is a committee of international central banks and bank regulators responsible for establishing international supervisory guidelines for use in member jurisdictions to enhance and align bank regulation and promote financial stability on a global scale in december and january the basel committee published the final revisions to the international regulatory capital framework generally referred to as basel iii as a response to deficiencies in the international regulatory standards identified during the global financial crisis effective july the federal reserve and the occ approved final rules known as the basel iii capital rules substantially revising the riskbased capital and leverage capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions including old national and old national bank the basel iii capital rules address the components of capital and other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions regulatory capital ratios the basel iii capital rules also implement the requirements of section of the doddfrank act to remove references to credit ratings from the federal banking agencies rules certain of the basel iii capital rules came into effect for old national and old national bank on january subject to a phasein period ending on december the basel iii capital rules introduced a new capital measure referred to as common equity tier cet1 the rules specify that tier capital consists of cet1 and additional tier capital instruments meeting specified requirements cet1 capital consists of common stock instruments that meet the eligibility criteria set forth in the final rules retained earnings accumulated other comprehensive income and common equity tier minority interest the rules also define cet1 narrowly by requiring that most adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to cet1 and not to the other components of capital they also expand the scope of the adjustments as compared to existing regulations as of january the basel iii capital rules require banking organizations to maintain a minimum ratio of cet1 to riskweighted assets of at least plus a capital conservation buffer which is added to the cet1 ratio effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of cet1 to riskweighted assets of at least a minimum ratio of tier capital to riskweighted assets of at least plus the capital conservation buffer which is added to the tier capital ratio effectively resulting in a minimum tier capital ratio of a minimum ratio of total capital that is tier plus tier capital to riskweighted assets of at least plus the capital conservation buffer which is added to the total capital ratio effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of and a minimum leverage ratio of calculated as the ratio of tier capital to adjusted average consolidated assets the capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress banking institutions with a ratio of cet1 to riskweighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer will face limitations on the payment of dividends common stock repurchases and discretionary cash payments to executive officers based on the amount of the shortfall the basel iii capital rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to cet1 these include for example the requirement that mortgage servicing rights deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions be deducted from cet1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds of cet1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed of cet1 beginning in this framework for regulatory capital deductions to cet1 was simplified by increasing the deduction threshold to at the individual level for each of the aforementioned categories under current capital standards the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income items included in capital are excluded for the purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios under the basel iii capital rules old national and old national bank are given a onetime election the optout election to filter certain aoci components comparable to the treatment under the current general riskbased capital rule the company chose the optout election on the march call report and fr y for old national bank and old national respectively implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to cet1 began on january and have been phasedin over a fiveyear period per year the implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on january at the level and was phasedin over a fouryear period increasing by that amount on each subsequent january until it reached on january the basel iii capital rules also provide for a countercyclical capital buffer that is applicable to only certain covered institutions and is not expected to have any current applicability to old national or old national bank in addition the basel iii capital rules revise the rules for calculating riskweighted assets to enhance their risk sensitivity they establish a new framework under which mortgagebacked securities and other securitization exposures will be subject to riskweights ranging from to the rules also establish adjusted riskweights for credit exposures including multifamily and commercial real estate exposures that are days or more past due or on nonaccrual which will be subject to a riskweight except in situations where qualifying collateral andor guarantees are in place the existing treatment of residential mortgage exposures will remain subject to either a riskweight for prudently underwritten owneroccupied first liens that are current or less than days past due or a riskweight for all other residential mortgage exposures including days or more past due exposures management believes that as of december old national and old national bank meet all capital adequacy requirements under the basel iii capital rules on a fully phasedin basis requirements to maintain higher levels of capital or to maintain higher levels of liquid assets could adversely impact the companys net income the basel iii capital rules also permit banks with less than billion in assets to choose to continue excluding unrealized gains and losses on certain securities holdings for purposes of calculating regulatory capital as previously reported old national chose the optout election in its march call report the liquidity framework under the basel iii capital rules the basel iii liquidity framework applies a balance sheet perspective to establish quantitative standards designed to ensure that a banking organization is appropriately positioned to satisfy its short and longterm funding needs one test to address shortterm liquidity risk is referred to as the liquidity coverage ratio lcr designed to calculate the ratio of a banking entitys highquality liquid assets to its total net cashflows over a 30day time horizon the other test referred to as the net stable funding ratio nsfr is designed to promote more medium and longterm asset funding by incenting banking entities to increase their holdings of us treasury securities and other sovereign debt as well as increase the use of longterm debt as a funding source the basel iii liquidity framework was implemented as a minimum standard on january with a phasein period ending january however the federal banking agencies have not proposed rules implementing the basel iii liquidity framework and have not determined to what extent it will apply to us banks that are not large internationally active banks management believes that as of december old national bank would meet the lcr requirement under the basel iii liquidity framework on a fully phasedin basis if such requirements were currently effective managements evaluation of the impact of the nsfr requirement is ongoing as of december requirements to maintain higher levels of liquid assets could adversely impact the companys net income prompt corrective action regulations the federal deposit insurance act the fdia requires among other things federal bank regulatory authorities to take prompt corrective action with respect to banks which do not meet minimum capital requirements under current prompt corrective action regulations a bank will be i well capitalized if the institution has a total riskbased capital ratio of or greater a tier riskbased capital ratio of or greater and a leverage ratio of or greater and is not subject to any order or written directive by any such regulatory authority to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure ii adequately capitalized if the institution has a total riskbased capital ratio of or greater a tier riskbased capital ratio of or greater and a leverage ratio of or greater and is not well capitalized iii undercapitalized if the institution has a total riskbased capital ratio that is less than a tier riskbased capital ratio of less than or a leverage ratio of less than iv significantly undercapitalized if the institution has a total riskbased capital ratio of less than a tier riskbased capital ratio of less than or a leverage ratio of less than and v critically undercapitalized if the institutions tangible equity is equal to or less than of average quarterly tangible assets an institution may be downgraded to or deemed to be in a capital category that is lower than indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters a banks capital category is determined solely for the purpose of applying prompt corrective action regulations and the capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of the banks overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes the basel iii capital rules revised the prompt corrective action regulations pursuant to section of the fdia by introducing a cet1 ratio requirement at each level other than critically undercapitalized with the required cet1 ratio being for wellcapitalized status increasing the minimum tier capital ratio requirement for each category with the minimum tier riskbased capital ratio for wellcapitalized status being as compared to the previous and eliminating the provision that provides that a bank with a composite supervisory rating of may have a leverage ratio and still be wellcapitalized the fdia generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distributions including payment of a dividend or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized undercapitalized institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan the agencies may not accept such a plan without determining among other things that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institutions capital in addition for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable the depository institutions parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan the bank holding company must also provide appropriate assurances of performance the aggregate liability of the parent holding company is limited to the lesser of i an amount equal to of the depository institutions total assets at the time it became undercapitalized and ii the amount which is necessary or would have been necessary to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan if a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator management believes that as of december old national bank was well capitalized based on the existing ratios and the ratios as modified by the basel iii capital rules deposit insurance substantially all of the deposits of old national bank are insured up to applicable limits by the deposit insurance fund dif of the fdic and old national bank is subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the dif deposit insurance assessments are based on average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity under the fdics riskbased assessment system insured institutions with at least billion in assets such as old national bank are assessed on the basis of a scoring system that combines the institutions regulatory ratings and certain financial measures the scoring system assesses risk measures to produce two scores a performance score and a loss severity score that will be combined and converted to an initial assessment rate the performance score measures an institutions financial performance and its ability to withstand stress the loss severity score quantifies the relative magnitude of potential losses to the fdic in the event of an institutions failure once the performance and loss severity scores are calculated these scores will be converted to a total score an institution with a total score of or less will pay the minimum base assessment rate and an institution with a total score of or more will pay the maximum initial base assessment rate for total scores between and initial base assessment rates will rise at an increasing rate as the total score increases the fdic has the authority to raise or lower assessment rates subject to limits and to impose special additional assessments under the fdia the fdic may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law regulation rule order or condition imposed by the fdic safety and soundness regulations in accordance with the fdia the federal banking agencies adopted safety and soundness guidelines establishing general standards relating to internal controls information systems internal audit systems loan documentation credit underwriting interest rate risk exposure asset growth asset quality earnings compensation fees and benefits in general the guidelines require among other things appropriate systems and practices to identify monitor and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines the guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer employee director or principal shareholder in addition regulations adopted by the federal banking agencies authorize the agencies to require that an institution that has been given notice that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan if after being so notified the institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an accepted compliance plan the agency must issue an order directing corrective actions and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject under the prompt corrective action provisions of fdia if the institution fails to comply with such an order the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties incentive compensation the doddfrank act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies and the sec to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentivebased payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least billion in total assets such as old national and old national bank that encourage inappropriate risks by providing an executive officer employee director or principal shareholder with excessive compensation fees or benefits or that could lead to material financial loss to the entity in addition these regulators must establish regulations or guidelines requiring enhanced disclosure to regulators of incentivebased compensation arrangements the agencies proposed such regulations in april but the regulations have not been finalized if the regulations are adopted in the form initially proposed they will impose limitations on the manner in which old national may structure compensation for its executives in june the federal reserve occ and fdic issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risktaking the guidance which covers all employees who have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization either individually or as part of a group is based upon the key principles that a banking organizations incentive compensation arrangements should i provide incentives that do not encourage risktaking beyond the organizations ability to effectively identify and manage risks ii be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management and iii be supported by strong corporate governance including active and effective oversight by the organizations board of directors these three principles are incorporated into the proposed joint compensation regulations under the doddfrank act discussed above the federal reserve will review as part of the regular riskfocused examination process the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations such as old national that are not large complex banking organizations these reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organizations activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements the findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination deficiencies will be incorporated into the organizations supervisory ratings which can affect the organizations ability to make acquisitions and take other actions enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related riskmanagement control or governance processes pose a risk to the organizations safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies loans to one borrower old national bank generally may not make loans or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of of unimpaired capital and surplus an additional amount may be loaned up to of unimpaired capital and surplus if the loan is secured by readily marketable collateral which generally does not include real estate as of december old national bank was in compliance with the loanstooneborrower limitations depositor preference the fdia provides that in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution the claims of depositors of the institution including the claims of the fdic as subrogee of insured depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as a receiver will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution if an insured depository institution fails insured and uninsured depositors along with the fdic will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured nondeposit creditors including depositors whose deposits are payable only outside of the united states and the parent bank holding company with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution community reinvestment act the community reinvestment act of cra requires depository institutions to assist in meeting the credit needs of their market areas consistent with safe and sound banking practice under the cra each depository institution is required to help meet the credit needs of its market areas by among other things providing credit to low and moderateincome individuals and communities depository institutions are periodically examined for compliance with the cra and are assigned ratings that must be publicly disclosed in order for a financial holding company to commence any new activity permitted by the bhc act or to acquire any company engaged in any new activity permitted by the bhc act each insured depository institution subsidiary of the financial holding company must have received a rating of at least satisfactory in its most recent examination under the cra furthermore banking regulators take into account cra ratings when considering approval of certain applications old national bank received a rating of satisfactory in its latest cra examination fair lending laws fair lending laws prohibit discrimination in banking services and include the equal credit opportunity act ecoa and the fair housing act fha which prohibit discrimination on the basis of race gender religion or other prohibited factors in the
