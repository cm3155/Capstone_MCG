we successfully navigated a challenging interest rate environment along with industrywide liquidity pressures earlier in the year at old national executing our basic banking strategy has served us well in fact our old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2024 adjusted eps return on average tangible common equity and efficiency ratio were the best in our nearly year history tangible book value per share also grew by yearoveryear combined with our roughly average dividend yield gave shareholders a strong return for the year our peerleading deposit franchise disciplined loan growth strong credit quality and wellmanaged expenses and dedicated team members who are committed to our clients and communities drove these outstanding results while many in our industry spent the year on defense we remain on the offense by continuing to invest in new clientfacing and key support talent and being ready and opportunistic for acquisitions as evidenced by our recently announced capstar bank partnership which will expand our franchise to the highly dynamic markets of nashville broader tennessee and asheville north carolina i will share more details about our progress with the strategic partnership later in my comments starting on slide gaap earnings for the year were and adjusted eps was a record per common share representing a increase yearoveryear our adjusted return on average tangible common equity and efficiency ratio were records at and respectively adjusted roa was a strong moving to slide we reported gaap earnings for the fourth quarter of per common share our adjusted eps was per common share and our adjusted results included higher than run rate cost related to a trueup of the accrual for the annual shortterm incentive plan and additional tax credit amortization for the quarter when combined resulted in an aftertax adjustment of approximately million or of earnings per share impact returning to our capstar partnership we have filed our regulatory application and announced an additional billion investment in tennessee as a part of our existing community growth plan as we spend time with our new team members we are even more excited about our partnership our existing team in nashville was already off to a great start and were seeing many new client acquisition opportunities from that team which will only build as we close on our partnership we still expect to close in the first half of the year in summary our eps results prove more durable than most peers in a challenging year due to relentless focus on the basics growing core deposits consistent strong underwriting disciplined expense management and ample capital brendon will provide you with our official outlook at the end of his prepared remarks but as i look forward its difficult to predict what the year will bring predictions range from a few rate cuts to more than a handful from a soft landing to something more severe regardless of what transpires we have entered in a strong position by continuing to execute on our basic banking strategy and we are set up to be successful in whatever comes our way as we have for the past years i would like to recognize mike scudder as planned michael retired as executive chairman of old national bancorp at the end of january i want to thank mike for his combined years of outstanding leadership and dedication to first midwest and old national his contributions to the board and me personally were invaluable as we completed our transformational partnership and successfully navigated the last two years thank you i will now turn the call over to brendon to cover the quarterly results in more detail brendon b falconer chief financial officer old national bancorp thanks jim beginning on slide we present our fourth quarter balance sheet which highlights improvements in both liquidity and capital positions our fourth quarter core deposit growth has allowed us to organically fund loan old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2024 growth and continue to reduce wholesale borrowings and brokered deposits we ended the year with a strong cet1 ratio of and we continue to accrete capital at a faster pace than most through the combination of our better than peer return profile and our atpeer payout ratio tangible book value per share grew quarteroverquarter and yearoveryear due to strong earnings and a improvement in aoci overall improvements in our liquidity and capital levels allowed us to stay on the offense in and our  performance only strengthens our position as we begin on slide we present the trend in total loan growth and portfolio yields total loans grew in line with our expectations and we remain focused on full relationships and structure at a price that meets our riskadjusted return requirements the investment portfolio increased during the quarter largely due to changes in fair values please note that we did execute a small loss trade on million of securities with an earnback inside of one year moving to slide we show our trend in total deposits which were stable quarteroverquarter including million of normal seasonal public fund outflows and a million decrease in brokered deposits our brokered deposit as a percentage of total deposits is now which is well below peers we experienced strong growth in both personal and business accounts largely through cd and money market promotions new checking account acquisition was strong and continues to outpace attrition however migration to higher yielding products continues to impact the growth in this category we are still experiencing upward pressure on deposit rates but we have seen a marked deceleration in deposit costs in the quarter and into january total deposit cost for the month of december was basis points only basis points higher than our  average overall we are exceptionally pleased with the execution of our deposit strategy that has led to above peer deposit growth at below peer costs slide provides our quarterend income statement we reported gaap net income applicable to common shares of a million or per share reported earnings include the following pretax items a million gain on the sale of visa class b shares as well as a million charge for the fdic special assessment million in mergerrelated charges and a million contract termination charge excluding these items our adjusted earnings per share was moving on to slide we present details of our net interest income and margin as expected deposit repricing led to modest declines in both net interest income and margin new loan production rates of and marginal funding costs in the low range support our expectation that net interest income should bottom out in  slide shows trends in adjusted noninterest income which was million for the quarter all of our primary fee businesses performed as expected with seasonally lower mortgage revenue continuing to slide we show the trend in adjusted noninterest expenses which were generally in line with our  guidance excluding million of yeartodate performancedriven incentive accrual trueup and million in higher amortization of tax credit investments our incentive plan was tied to deposit costs and growth relative to our midsized peers our outperformance in both these categories was critical to our record year and ultimately drove the higher incentive the tax credit amortization charge was due to timing of project completion with the corresponding offset in tax expense while both these items are within core earnings we obviously do not expect them to run rate into first quarter old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2024 on slide we present our credit trends which remained stable reflecting the quality of both our commercial and consumer portfolios delinquency and nonperforming loan ratios are largely unchanged nonpcd net chargeoffs were a low basis points with pcd chargeoffs of basis points our fourth quarter allowance including reserve for unfunded commitments was unchanged at a basis points and there were no material changes to our model assumptions and the weighting on the moodys s3 scenario remains at on slide we provide a comprehensive overview of our capital position at the end of the quarter we observed improvements in all regulatory capital ratios and an increase in our tce ratio driven by strong earnings and assisted by improvements in aoci following our recovery in  we anticipate an additional of our outstanding aoci to accrete to capital by the end of in summary we are very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year performance in what was a challenging year for our industry proved to be a record year in a number of critical performance metrics including adjusted eps return on tangible common equity and efficiency ratio we have improved the efficiency of our balance sheet with strong core deposit growth which has led to better funding mix and better than expected net interest income we continue to demonstrate our ability to expand our customer base while maintaining peerleading deposit costs our strong liquidity also positions us well to take advantage of new lending opportunities the credit portfolio remained stable and our disciplined approach to managing expenses is evident in our full year adjusted efficiency ratio of slide includes additional detail on our rate risk position and net interest income guidance nii is expected to fall approximately in  remain flat in  and then begin to increase in the back half of the year the assumptions are all listed on the slide but i would highlight a few of the primary drivers first we assumed three rate cuts in the back half consistent with the fed guidance second we are anticipating additional late cycle deposit repricing that will give us a terminal beta of by midyear and a noninterest bearing deposit mix that falls to by yearend lastly we assume the closing of our capstar partnership at the end of  we believe we have positioned the balance sheet well as we approach the end of this rate cycle with most of the work to achieve a neutral rate risk position behind us also we did run a forward curve scenario including six rate cuts and the result was not materially different from our three rate cut scenario slide includes thoughts on our outlook for the remaining items for the first quarter and full year and all guidance assumes capstar closes at the end of  we believe our current loan pipeline should support first quarter growth in the to range and full year growth of to we anticipate continued success in the execution of our deposit strategy and expect to meet or exceed the industry growth in we expect  noninterest income to be consistent with  with the full year up to with the typical seasonal patterns our expense outlook for the first quarter should be approximately million modestly higher than our  base of million which excludes the incentive trueup and tax credit impact for the full year we expect expenses just over billion net chargeoffs are expected to range between basis points to basis points and provision expense should be approximately million to million for the full year of this excludes the day one nonpcd double count associated with the acquisition turning to taxes we old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2024 expect both a first quarter and full year effective tax rate of approximately on a core fte basis and on a gaap basis with those comments id like to open up the call for your questions we do have the full team available including mark sander jim sandgren and john moran question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question will come from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler please go ahead r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning everybody thanks for taking the question james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp good morning scott good to hear from you r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co you too you too thank you brendon i wanted to ask you about some of the nuance in the nii so it looks like nii should drop in the first quarter which is great maybe i was hoping you could discuss some of the puts and takes obviously day count becomes a factor in the first quarter but maybe sort of the interplay with how the margin fits in there and then i think that you said margin might expand in the second half if i heard that correctly maybe just some thoughts as we go forward brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp sure scott yeah so were looking at approximately a basis point decline in net interest margin into  levels off from there and probably growth a little in the back half obviously as we get three rate cuts since we position the balance sheet accordingly we dont think well get a lot of impact from or negative impact from rate cuts in the back half and then we get the benefit of all the fixed asset repricing and the growth both organic and from capstar in the back half of r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect and then i guess along the lines of sort of underlying loan growth youve kept the to expectation maybe just some thoughts on how that evolves through the year and industry trends have of course been pretty soft but i think you guys have gotten at least your fair share if not a little more of any opportunities that are out there so maybe just sort of your thoughts on how things trend including demand through the year james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2024 i think you summarized it well scott i mean as much as loan demand has slowed somewhat customers are still feeling okay ci clients are i would say cautiously optimistic for financials are holding up well employment levels are keeping consumer spending at solid levels and but again i think that most of them think growth is going to slow a little bit in and cre activity of course slowed in the last year as expected as we got into but its begun to pick up a little bit competitors are getting more active and as much as that still has to play out theres a rents are holding up well in the segments that were active in in multifamily and industrial r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect okay good thank you guys very much brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp thanks scott operator your next question comes from the line of terry mcevoy with stephens please go ahead terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thanks good morning everybody brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp hi terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc maybe first question hi could you maybe expand on the billion of time deposits repricing over the next year im seeing kind of brokered cds were over billion other times were just below billion and it looks like the sevenmonth promo is about billion so what are your underlying assumptions there brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah so a lot of these cds indiscernible not almost but exactly of our time deposits will mature within the next months i think you have the weighted average rate really close in that four handle and so well have the opportunity to reprice a bulk of these cds lower throughout the year in fact the repricing characteristic actually gives an opportunity to reprice those most of those early in the first half of terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc and then maybe just stepping out of the model for a bit jim were hearing the word scale more and more from banks with assets call it over a billion or over billion so my question is how are you thinking about scale as a billion bank and your ability to compete with community banks as well as the larger banks old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2024 james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp terry i really think were in a sweet spot were big enough ph to be relevant and compete for almost any client situation in the markets we serve were not so big that we get in our own way sometimes as you get bigger we know that happens were close to our clients were nimble were fast were opportunistic we can reach out and touch our clients and touch our team members on a regular basis i really like the size were at today and given where were operating on an efficiency ratio basis i think were operating fairly efficiently so im really happy where were at and dont see any need to do anything dramatically different than were at today terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc great thanks for taking my questions james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp thanks terry good to hear from you hope youre staying warm operator your next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty with kbw please go ahead christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc oh great good morning james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp good morning chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc maybe a question on credit you still have a pcd mark for first midwest how should we be thinking about portfolios that youre maybe watching a little bit more closely going into any derisking or exits or tweaking that needs to happen and just kind of broader credit commentary thanks mark g sander a president chief operating officer old national bancorp yeah we feel good about where we are with credit certainly chris this is mark we saw a little further modest risk rating migration in  but consistent with a little bit of a slowdown and a more limited growth i mean we feel good about where our portfolio is at theres certainly areas were watching more closely obviously cre office like everyone and thatll remain to be play out senior housing is something that is slowly recovering but is the portfolio quality there we feel really good about so no real changes in our underwriting and feel real good about where were at christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2024 great thanks and then maybe brendon a question just on the balance sheet how do we think about maybe adding bonds at this point to reduce more rate sensitivity just overall size of earning assets for brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah yeah yeah great question so i think theres some i think theres some opportunity some work to do on a rate risk position that will include likely some reinvestment of cash flows in the invest portfolio and probably adding some floating rate debt to offset so i think that would enhance our rate risk position and not have a negative impact on net interest income christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay but just beyond the maturing cash flows of the bond book will the bond book grow in an absolute basis or just brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp no no not expected to grow but i do think well start to replace it and hold it at approximately at these levels christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of brody preston with ubs please go ahead brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning everybody thanks for taking the questions james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp good morning brody brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc jim i can i dont know i guess ill speak for terry and say were both cold up here in maine james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp i appreciate were indiscernible brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc i just wanted to ask on the running on the nuances of the deposit beta commentary so were going to peak at is that happening in and then the declining to a total beta of the low by feels a bit more old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2024 conservative than what some of your larger peers have kind of outlined in terms of talking about pretty aggressive down betas within their nii guide and i guess what makes you feel more conservative when you talk about your beta brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah sure ill answer the first part of that first so we think our deposit beta peaks on the upcycle not so although kind of a very slight modest kind of quarteroverquarter impact to total deposit costs from to in our model on the back half we didnt go up as high we have of our book as exception price we think we can drive a really strong beta down on that side but i also think deposits are still really valuable and we got to be pay attention to maintaining continuing to grow deposits to continue to take advantage of lending opportunities and i think that probably informs the more conservative guide on the way down brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay got it and i wanted just to also ask on the securities could you remind us i think you have over a billion in securities that are set to mature and reprice in would you plan on kind of running those down and using it to fund the good loan growth that youve talked about in the guidance brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp i think a little bit of a mix brody certainly we will start to reinvest some of the cash flows off of that book and thatll come at a positive spread about basis points and well see how the rest of the year plays out and a lot of that is dependent on our ability to continue to grow deposits well and then ultimately loan demand brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it and if i could just sneak one more in the billion of balance sheet hedges that you have are can you just clarify are those is that just on the loan book and then do you have any maturities of swaps occurring in or that are meaningful that we need to be aware about brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah so its a mix on both the invest portfolio and our on our loans i think we dont have a ton maturing we actually had the duration of these pretty pretty far out as we are trying to we didnt want to be too precise on the timing expectation around rate cuts so we have ph some cuts no major maturities or anything rolling off of significance there and probably some more work to do before were done with the year brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay great thank you very much james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp thanks brody old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2024 operator your next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please go ahead jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good morning everyone james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp good morning jon jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc a couple of followups by the way slide is really good thats a great slide terry took one of the questions on cd repricing but you talk about exception pricing on of your deposits has that eased at all is that just a product over last spring or early summer is that persistent brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp thats been fairly persistent we continue to go out there weve been unapologetically aggressive in gathering new deposits and so thats creeped up a little bit every quarter and well continue to be aggressive although we could do that at marginally lower rates in this environment than we have for the last couple of quarters so we think that exception price or marginal cost will be a little lower than it has been but that yeah thats been a big part of our success this year jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay slide you talk about your commercial real estate maturing inside of months and just a small bit of it is youve got that demarcation line i understand that but what is the message here on credit is it that were going to see some incremental npls as this stuff gets repriced and reworked or youre just youre not seeing that at this point in time james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp were not seeing this that at this point at this point in time i think again the cre office still has some time to play out so could you see some go to criticized and classified could you see that increase a little bit yes but we dont we think were ahead of identifying we like to identify early and aggressively take action i think thats what we continue to do so were just trying to size up kind of where some of the risks are we think theyre very manageable jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay good and then if i can add one more just jim anything on capstar anything new to report or updates and just you put out a date i know thats difficult but just confidence level and putting that date out for a close thanks old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2024 james a sandgren a chief executive officercommercial banking old national bancorp we feel really good where we stand today both in terms of the people and the client opportunities i mean every time were with our team members both the existing team members and our new team members we just feel really good about the opportunities and i do think some of that growth were going to experience is going to come out of places like nashville detroit kansas city st louis weve got new team members that weve hired in the last handful of years just to continue to execute and create new opportunities for us that just werent available to us in the past with respect to the regulatory applications were really good about that were in constant dialogue with the regulators we obviously announced our addendum to our existing community growth plan which we thought was an important step as a part of the process to get to the finish line here so i mean its hard to always predict exactly when youre going to get approval for these things but nonetheless we feel really good about where we stand at this point in time and more importantly i just think nashville tennessee the asheville location will continue to represent a great opportunity for us to grow and probably contribute in the future in a much more meaningful level than even a typical partnership of that size would contribute jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay youve got some new investor day potential locations as well james a sandgren a chief executive officercommercial banking old national bancorp i like it i like it jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc all right thank you james a sandgren a chief executive officercommercial banking old national bancorp thanks
