please go ahead james c ryan iii chief executive officer director old national bancorp good morning earlier this morning we reported strong fourth quarter earnings which put an exclamation point on an incredible year for old national one that saw the closing of our transformational merger with first midwest successful completion of all related systems conversions tremendous client growth and strong talent retention and attraction the strength of our combined franchise is evident in the results outlined on slide old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2023 adjusted eps was per common share representing a increase quarter to quarter with a strong adjusted roa and roatce of and respectively our efficiency ratio was a record low of im pleased to share that we achieved the quarterly expense run rate necessary to fulfill our million of modeled merger expense savings moving to slide we reported gaap earnings for the entire year of per common share our adjusted eps was per common share representing a increase over these robust quarterly and annual results with indiscernible returns were driven by a focused execution on our successful merger maintaining our strong low cost deposit franchise growing loans with consistent strong credit standards and disciplined expense management we were also pleased that the indiscernible balances remained relatively flat for the year excluding the recent sale of hsa deposits while maintaining our deposit pricing discipline with a low deposit beta cycle to date another highlight in the year is our continual investment in top revenuegenerating talent across our footprint our story resonates well with these individuals and our talent pipeline remains robust you may have seen our recent press release last week with the official launch of high net worth wealth manager brand this is a fantastic opportunity to leverage our combined franchise of strength and recent talent investments we are already adding new clients to as we look forward we feel good about and expect loan portfolios to continue to grow albeit not at pace in other areas it should be more of the same below peer deposit cost to drive a funding advantage more organic growth in our wealth management client base a continued focus on its disciplined expense management while we dont see anything meaningful on the horizon it gives us cause for concern on credit we know that our granular portfolio attention to client selection and consistent underwriting guidelines as well as our active approach to credit management will serve us well if the economy turns worse in other words we intend to stay on the offense but we are well positioned to withstand any new challenges that lie ahead thank you i will now turn the call over to brendon for further details brendon b falconer chief financial officer old national bancorp thanks jim turning to the quarters results on slide we reported gaap net income applicable to common shares of million or per share reported earnings include a million of pretax gain from the sale of our hsa business which was partially offset by million in pretax property optimization charges and million in pretax mergerrelated charges excluding these items as well as debt securities losses our adjusted earnings per share was slide shows the trend in total loan growth excluding ppp loans total loans were million led by commercial growth of million and consumer growth of million both commercial and consumer grew an annualized the investment portfolio decreased by quarter over quarter due to reinvestment of portfolio cash flows in support of loan growth we expect billion in total investment cash flows over the next months slide provides further details of our commercial loans and pipeline the strong fourth quarter growth was well distributed with annualized growth in ci and in cre  production put some pressure on the pipeline but loan demand remains healthy and we expect the continued organic loan growth in the midsingledigit range turning briefly to pricing new money yields on ci increased basis points from  to with new cre old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2023 production yields up basis points to weve maintained our pricing discipline throughout the race cycle and are pleased that our spreads have remained stable slide show details of our  commercial production the billion of production was wellbalanced across all product lines and major markets in addition all of our product segments posted quarter over quarter balance sheet growth we are pleased with the contribution from our newest lpo markets which contributed almost million in production this quarter moving to slide average deposits excluding the hsa sale were down quarter over quarter with the mix of our noninterest bearing deposits stable at endofperiod deposits were impacted million related to the hsa sale and an additional million in seasonal public fund outflows endofperiod deposits also reflects the beginning of the mix shift from interestbearing transaction accounts into time deposits our loantodeposit ratio combined with wholesale funding capacity and asset liquidity in the form of our investment and indirect books provides us flexibility in this competitive deposit market that said we are actively defending deposit balances through competitive ph ramp rates and pricing exceptions we are also playing offense through various deposit specials throughout our footprint we are pleased with our execution of this strategy to date as we have been able to generate new deposits sufficient to maintain stable overall balances market conditions have put upward pressure on deposit rates with average total deposit cost of basis points quarter per quarter to a still very low basis points interestbearing deposit cost increased to basis points resulting in an industryleading cycletodate beta of our granular lowcost deposit base should continue to give us a funding advantage throughout the remainder of this rate cycle next on slide you will see details of our net interest income and margin both metrics exceeded expectations largely due to the outperformance of our deposit beta assumption net interest margin expanded basis points quarter over quarter to with core margin excluding accretion up basis points to slide provides additional details on our asset liability position and projected margin range core margin for  is expected to be in line with  taking into account the basis points of march decline related to ph beta our outlook assumes deposit betas increasing from today to a cycletodate beta in the first quarter of the assumptions in our outlook also including cet1 target rate of and a yield on 10year treasuries at the end of the first quarter specific margin guidance is challenging the indiscernible but assuming that that ph pause will stay in  and deposit repricing persists we would expect pressure on margin in the back half of also while we remain wellpositioned for rising rates we have been proactively adding downrate protection including an additional million of new hedges this quarter with an average floor strike of slide shows trends in adjusted noninterest income which was million for the quarter this was generally in line with our expectations as market conditions continue to put pressure on mortgage and wealth revenues the linked quarter decrease was also impacted by lower capital markets fees which reflect lower demand for interest rate swap products given the rate environment fees were all impacted by one month of service charge enhancements implemented in december that were discussed last quarter again we estimate approximately million annual impact from service charge enhancements old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2023 next slide shows the trend in adjusted noninterest expenses adjusting for merger charges property optimization charges and tax credit amortization noninterest expense was million and our adjusted efficiency ratio was an historically low expenses decreased million quarter over quarter due to lower salaries and data processing expenses expenses were higher than anticipated due to million quarter over quarter increase in incentive accruals given our strong earnings performance for the year excluding incentive adjustments we are pleased to report that we have achieved a quarterly expense run rate consistent with our modeled cost synergies we thought it would be helpful to provide additional detail on our expense outlook we believe million is the correct quarterly run rate to build off for your models from this million annualized base we anticipate annual impact of million in tax credit amortization million for ph merrick an incremental increase in fdic expenses of million and approximately million in strategic investments in both talent and technology enhancements these investments will be partially funded with approximately million in expense saves from the real estate optimization actions taken in  slide shows our credit trend credit conditions are stable and our commercial and consumer portfolios continue to perform exceptionally well net chargeoffs were a modest basis points our special assets team is continuing to work through our pcd loans and expect chargeoffs from this portfolio to increase but with variability from quarter to quarter the provision expense impact on this effort should be minimal as we carry million or approximately reserve against the pcd book on slide you will see the details of our fourth quarter allowance including reserve for unfunded commitments which stands at million up million over  note that during the quarter we reclassified both current and prior quarter allowance for unfunded commitments from noninterest expense to provision allowance for credit loss totals and metrics now include the allowance for unfunded commitments providing a more complete view of our allowance levels this accounting treatment is also more consistent with peers and should aim in comparability reserve build was driven primarily by strong loan growth with relatively small increases due to portfolio mix partly offset by improvements in our economic forecast the financial help for clients remain strong and while credit metrics are stable we believe it is prudent to maintain elevated reserves given the uncertainty in our base case and economic outlook our current reserves reflect a relatively severe economic scenario including negative gdp of and unemployment of which is at the top end of our supportable range unless the economic outlook deteriorates materially provision expense should be limited to portfolio performance and loan growth in addition to the million in reserves we also carry million in acquired loan discount ph marks slide provides details on our capital position at quarter end capital ratios improved across the board our cet1 ratio grew to a very healthy and our tce ratio increased basis points to total oci was stable quarter over quarter but is still impacting our tce ratio by basis points we continue to monitor our balance sheet for economic stress and feel very comfortable with our capital levels as i wrap up my comments here are some key takeaways we ended a transformational year for onb with fantastic full year results and then an even better fourth quarter adjusted eps grew and tangible book value per share grew in the quarter key profitability ratio has also improved from very strong  results with an adjusted return on tangible common equity of and return on average assets of old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2023 we posted another solid quarter of quality organic loan growth and defended our deposit base well net interest income improved million with basis points of core margin expansion and an industryleading cycletodate deposit beta of we are also pleased to have achieved a quarterly expense run rate consistent with our modeled merger cost synergies resulting in a recordlow efficiency ratio of slide includes thoughts and our outlook for we believe commercial sentiment and our yearend pipeline supports midsingledigit loan growth in net interest income and margins should be consistent with the guidance we outlined earlier with pressure from deposit repricing in the back half of the year we expect our fee businesses to continue to perform well despite headwinds with mortgage following industry patterns while our wealth business will be subject to market volatility we are beginning to see revenue momentum from the strategic hires weve made over the last months capital markets revenue is under pressure and should perform consistent with  levels service charge changes implemented in december that are largely consistent with industry best practice will impact full year by approximately million our expense outlook is consistent with guidance we outlined earlier turning to taxes we expect approximately million in tax rate amortization for with a corresponding full year effective tax rate of on a core fte basis and on a gaap basis with those comments id like to open the call for your questions we do have the full team available including mark sander jim sandgren and john moran question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions we will just take a brief moment to allow the questions to fill into the queue our first question today comes from the line of ben gerlinger with hovde group ben please go ahead benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc right good morning everyone james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp good morning ben benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc ph i appreciate the guidance you guys gave on expenses and the waterfall is really helpful when you think about i think obviously everyones a little bit more skeptical in economic outlook when you think about hires i know thats kind of a priority longer term and the investment in the company taking decades rather than quarters but is there any way you would possibly slow because you dont necessarily want to hire lenders going into a recession or any type of lending that youre looking to lean into old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2023 james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp i just think theres great opportunities for us to tell our story when we get those opportunities and people are interested i think were always going to have a place for top talent and mark sander said this really well top talent will pay for itself so while wed be thoughtful and deliberate about all of our new hires i think when given the opportunity to attract i mean this is really the top quartile top decile of each of the marketplaces were going to go ahead and hire those folks but again well be thoughtful if the economic outlook looks materially different than when we look at it today were going to be thoughtful about adding expenses and well be diligent about looking at ways to reduce cost as well so but at this point in time i just dont see anything different than the plan which is to go ahead and attract the best possible talent we can to the organization benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc got you thats fair and then obviously hires as broadly speaking in terms of lenders so when you think about the fee income line theres a lot of moving parts in a lot of different businesse i know the recently announced wealth management is a big positive but obviously you guys cant project the full year fee income with mortgages involved a factor in that but when you think about it are we out of floor in mortgage and from here do you think fee income rebounds holistically james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp let me give you a 50000foot view and then ill have our cfo jump in id like to think that mortgage doesnt get much worse than where were at today right and a lot of the balance sheet a lot of production doing today hit their balance sheet not the fee income line in terms of wealth the good news is were basically taking our business and dividing it into a couple of different businesses and is one of those businesses right theres not a big increase needed to staff that and i would say that the talent were looking for is both on the commercial side business banking and but its also the wealth management side thats a big part of where were headed the good news is we have all the talent we need to get off the ground and running at a high level so its not a big required investment there but we do have high expectations that will grow kind of above our historic norms in that business despite what market conditions there market conditions are going to be what theyre going to be but nonetheless we have pretty high expectations around our ability to grow that organically a and just before i turn over to brendon ben ill just add to what jim said a number of those hires that we put on in were in wealth management so as we hired a dozen to a quarter probably half of those were indiscernible so were not more than sufficiently staffed to grow in wealth brendon brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp ph probably the only thing left to add on that than to double click into mortgage i think we have to remember yearoveryear at least in the early part of the year did include some elevated indiscernible sale margins so id say we had were at a slower terms of production gain on sale margins today but old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2023 we were aided in the first half of last year by elevated indiscernible sale margins so that will impact yearoveryear numbers james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp okay id also like to think in the capital markets business right i mean it was a difficult time with rates rising very quickly but those businesses find a way to adjust and offer new products or different products particularly if theres a different set of newer rates emerging so i think therell be opportunities to grow that business obviously the fourth quarter is a tough quarter for that business overall benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc got you if i can sneak one more and any appetite for potential repurchase or capital deployment i know that you guys were historically looking to kind of support the growth but if growth is slowing down into a recession and just overall thoughts on that james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp yeah i think its a little too early to want to jump in that i think we need to have more clear picture of economic outlook any issues related to credit out there i think we need to have a much clearer picture before we want to jump on top of that benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc sounds good i appreciate the time ill step back in the queue and let scott ask some boring deposit questions james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp thanks ben sure scott appreciate the time operator our next question comes from scott siefers with piper sandler please go ahead scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning everybody james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp good morning scott good to hear from you r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co thank you that just seemed gratuitous but i certainly have to say brendon everyones probably the most exciting topic i can pick up so in margin you talked about margin pressure in the second half you have sort of a old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2023 thought for order of magnitude and maybe a sense for a lower bound where the margins could settle in the event that things do start to degrade brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp its really hard scott to pinpoint something so much of this depends on what the fed does if the fed kind of keeps their foot on the gas we could see maybe even marginal margin expansion but they pause for a while and deposits continue to reprice low demand remains relatively strong i think that would be that kind of the worstcase scenario in terms of margin pressure just hard to know where those deposit betas fall out the one thing id we continue to talk to ourselves about is whatever that is i think we have a competitive advantage our deposit beta was half the industry last cycle and i expect we can have a significant advantage over the industry in this cycle r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect and i guess just for reference when we talk about potential degradation in the second half i know youre hesitant to offer indiscernible the first quarter but is that ph the best starting point for the margin or is something in like the low to mid ph more appropriate in other words it goes down in the due largely to day counts does it go down and stay down or would it bounce back all else equal brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp all else equal right it would bounce back and so  would not have the same level of day impact and then what happens in the back half of the year i think is really going to come down to where do deposit costs fall out r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp indiscernible opposite direction right i mean that can alleviate some pressure on deposit rates as well r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah perfect okay good thank you very much operator our next question comes from terry mcevoy with stephens terry please go ahead terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi thanks good morning everyone james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2023 good to hear from you terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi maybe just a question slide youve got the 10year at by the end of this quarter versus the ph today and im just kind of wondering how that good impact the outlook the 10year does not change and then maybe as a followup and some on nii do you think even with some margin compression in the back half of this year the loan growth and the balance sheet growth can support growth in net interest income as we progress throughout brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp i dont think its not a huge impact from the 10year move around it will impact a little bit of our investment book and indiscernible but not a huge material impact its the same thing with nii certainly loan growth earning asset remix will help support nii but the total nii that was again id point back to the guidance and its really going to come down to where deposit costs fall out in indiscernible in the back half of the year terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc okay and then maybe just stick with kind of the hedging strategy added more swaps in the fourth quarter could you maybe talk about kind of receive rate duration of the additional hedges and bigger picture whats the strategy from here on protecting the margin from lower rates brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah duration on the hedges have been roughly around three years the average strike on that floor today is of the entire billion is right around the most recent ones obviously have a strike significantly higher than that so i think thatll provide some meaningful protection and as you think about it as deposit costs continue to reprice up if and when the fed starts to move weve got a lot of support by being able to reduce deposit cost in the back half so as we think about positioning the balance sheet towards a more neutral position i think were a long way towards that goal already terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc okay maybe one last small question if i could is the tax rate creeping higher at core fte it just seems like it havent gone back to past presentations it just seems like its kind of gotten higher the last few quarters am i correct and if so whats behind that and if im not then we can move on brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp no youre correct absolutely we had obviously with the ph smb partnership we had a lot of earnings but our tax credit business has not increased by double so were working on a strategy if its needed to invest in that business and we look to move that forward but nothing in the nearterm is going to change that so we ph took it out of the guidance we gave you old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2023 terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc okay thanks for taking my questions appreciate it james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp thanks terry operator our next question comes from chris mcgratty with kbw chris please go ahead christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah great good morning james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp good morning chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc brendon hey good morning jim brendon or jim the efficiency ratio you talked about you know just been a great level how should we be thinking about the trajectory of this metric i know its one metric but balancing both sides of the equation how do we think about directionally that the efficiency ratio work kind of settles brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp so obviously we give you the express outlook for where the efficiency ratio falls out will largely be a function of where revenues revenue sit but i can tell you this sort of this i dont know that we can repeat but i do think for the full year were going to have a really strong efficiency ratio and we continue to work on opportunities that youre going to need to control expenses james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp yeah i would just suggest that chris weve had a long history of being very disciplined around the expense base here and it was obviously been nice to have some tailwind from the revenue side to help us out but having said that theres no magic bullets or no easy wins out there but its going to be a continued longterm focus on driving expenses lower a lot of these come through just longterm enhancements through technology and business process automation would help which should help continue to reduce costs so theres not any quick wins out there that are going to reduce us significantly but its just the continued focus on by our leadership and management teams to make sure that were driving our expense dollars more sufficiently as we can christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2023 if i could just push on that a little bit i think in the deck you say theres million of savings coming from this branch optimization the onetimers ph were call it how do i wrestle with that kind of earnback math is there something im missing in that strategy like i wouldve expected a little bit more to fall i guess to the bottom line james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp yeah i mean most of this was from real estate this redisposition right so the reality is i think its something less than a fiveyear earnback its still longer than we would anticipate normally but nonetheless we think was the right these were properties which are problematic around pieces of property in total about half of those were in the branch ph world but very small branches so again something like more or less than a five year earnback a little longer wed like it to be but appropriate for us particularly given the indiscernible we had to reinvest christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it great and then maybe i could on credit i think im getting some questions about whats the pace of reserve build you guys have i think been viewed as very very good on credit indiscernible history is a little bit more chunky but overall you kind of put them together pretty good credit how do we think about i guess two questions the pace of build based on your economic forecast and also how you view the kind of a normalized chargeoffs for this pro forma company brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah i think were in a good spot and that we really never released a lot of the excess reserves we carried in through from covid were continuing to put up a pretty severe economic scenario through our model so its difficult for us to sit here today to think about a more adverse scenario coming through in reality so we think provisions limited to portfolio changes and growth and in terms of chargeoffs i think weve had a good run i dont know what normalized chargeoffs looks like in going into next year or what the economy may provide us but i do think we have significant amount of coverage the pte book that came over from ph smb is a to reserve against that book so i think that will also go a long way in offsetting incremental provision expense associated with the merger christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thats helpful but the reserve at ph how do you view like the fully loaded reserve with the mark in ph smb whats the real metric you guys are tracking internally as like in terms of coverage brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp indiscernible so if we think about the entire the million of additional discount and credit of overall number christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2023 okay got it thank you brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp thank you chris operator our next question comes from david long with raymond james david please go ahead david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning everyone my question first question here is related to funding loan growth and loan growth youve got a pretty decent expectation for with the potential for some deposit outflows how do you look to fund that growth it looks like securities youll get a little bit there but that may not close fill that whole gap brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp so we have opportunities in the mortgage book in the indirect book and have liquidity in those forms in addition to the investment portfolio we also have a lot of wholesale funding capacity and that said we are still out there fighting hard for deposits and were going to work hard to maintain those levels and as we go through we grant its going to be a tough environment but were certainly not giving up and were out there playing offense so the combination of those three items is how were going to fund it were confident we have enough liquidity to make sure we support that commercial team and the growth of that book a yeah i think were defending our deposit base quite well and the ones and getting more aggressive where we have to and you saw some of that repricing happening this quarter consistent with the rest of the industry and i still feel confident in our ability to raise deposits deposit gathering is a large component of the goals in every one of our lines of business and were adding net new clients in every business and so i feel confident in our ability to raise deposits as we need them dave david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc okay all right great and then you gave some commentary around the deposit service charges and the changes in some of the your products there is the fourth quarter number its a little over is that the right run rate is it fully baked in or is there still a little bit more out of that to get to the right run rate into the first quarter brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah the service charge line has more than just the nsf fee items in there it is only one month of the nsf related changes have been baked in there but i think if you look back at sort of a couple quarters average its probably a better view of you look at  would be a better view of sort of more stable business and type of service charges old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2023 david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc okay great and then just to sneak one last one in here on the operating expense guide million appreciate the color there but i know you say it depends on the revenue side of the equation but what are you assuming or can you talk about what youre assuming on the incentive compensation to get to that million level and how that impacts the revenue side brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp so million that would include incentives really at target as opposed to above target obviously we were we benefited from a really great year this year and so incentives were significantly higher this year relative to what were projecting james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp its consistent with the revenue expectations we all have laid out right so if revenue goes up significantly then clearly we have some more incentive opportunity but given the revenue outlook we provided you and the expense base that goals are consistent with each other david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it thanks a lot guys appreciate it james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp thanks david good to hear from you operator our next question comes from jon arfstrom with rbc please go ahead jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey good morning everyone james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc question for you guys on loan growth brendon youve made a comment and i think i got it right but some of the fourth quarter production puts some pressure on the pipelines but you still expect decent growth what are you guys seeing in the pipelines is it slowing and what is your view on the cadence of growth do you expect continued strong first and second quarter growth and it slows later in the year just give us your thoughts on that old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2023 james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp well ill start and jim sandgren can add a little bit jon i think we feel good about certainly the pipeline coming down is a reflection of three really strong quarters of loan growth and there normally is a little bit of reduction of pipeline in  so thats normal seasonal reduction so when we think the pipeline is at a level that can provide the growth that brendon laid out midsingle digits for full year and the shortterm still is good i mean as much as there is mixed signals out there in the economy our ci clients are still strong theyre a little more cautious than they were before but theres still their business is solid and strong and the balances are good and theyre still investing so cre has slowed a bit the interest rate environment has suddenly brought down the pipeline there so we expect a less robust during there jim i think it is james a sandgren a chief executive officercommercial banking old national bancorp well i think thats really well said i think our ci customers actually feel pretty good about things theyre cautiously optimistic and continuing to invest so well see how that plays out the rest of the year and to marks comments about cre obviously interest rates are causing pressure on pipelines there but well stay close to our borrowers and have opportunities to do the right deals with the right clients jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay you also mentioned deposit price and exceptions and deposit specials were a couple of comments you made earlier can you talk about how prevalent that is and kind of what youre doing there james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp so we have special pricing and about of our nontime deposit customers right now so now client by client were negotiating we have given our teams tools to price as they need to to stay market competitive and retain deposits and as brendon mentioned we have a number of promotional specials in every line of business to raise deposits from money markets to cds to the new checking account promotion jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay brendon you talked about ph billion in cash flows on the securities portfolio over the next months what kind of uplift do you think youre going to get on those repurchases on the new purchases and give us an idea of what youre interested in buying and kind of the duration on that brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp a lot of those cash was actually reinvested right into the loan book so the lift is indiscernible the runoff yield moving into being loan yields that are north of today so a meaningful uplift on those cash flows as we think about nii going forward jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2023 okay and then jim youll love this one but do you feel youre done with first midwest both sides the merger things are tracking well and any appetite whatsoever to be back in the ma market thanks james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp from a systems perspective theres not a ph the project officially concluded i think the reality though is were continuing to look at ways to get better at what we do both in the back office and the front office and then were spending an awful lot of time on culture leadership teams spent the last year really building a strong culture together and now were continuing to find ways to drive it deeper and deeper in our organization so that works going to take years jon to continue to complete but i feel really good about where we stand and in fact we joke with ourselves im not sure we could have painted a better picture of how we come together as two organizations two large organizations coming together and so i feel really good about that obviously the results we feel great about the results given all that went on this year and so that couldnt actually feel any better with respect to the next opportunities to come along well continue to have active conversations and dialogues but i can tell you its not top of mind for us to think about wanting to do something right now but nonetheless these are longterm relationship building activities were going to continue to engage in and those will be important to our future at the same time we have an obligation to our shareholders to make sure whatever we do is really disciplined and shareholderfriendly so were going to stay focused on organic growth and building out our teams with new talent and then if the right partner comes along and its the right fit and timing for us well take a look at it but theres a lot of ifs in there before we think about doing our next partnership jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thank you james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp thanks jon good to hear from you operator our next question is a followup from scott siefers with piper sandler please go ahead scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey guys thanks for taking the followup i just want to go back to the expenses just on im kind of crystal clear on it so the million launching point thats a core number but the million expectation includes it looks like about million of items that are not included in the starting point from the million tax credit amortization and the million of property optimization so would more kind of apples to apples expectation be million for in other words if you were to hit this guide would you call the adjusted expenses million brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp we would call it million wed exclude the entire tax credit amortization so itd
