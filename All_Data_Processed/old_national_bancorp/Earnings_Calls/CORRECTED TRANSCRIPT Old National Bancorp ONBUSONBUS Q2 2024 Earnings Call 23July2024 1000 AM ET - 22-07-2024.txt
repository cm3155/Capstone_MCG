expectations due to better than expected revenue growth and lower expenses which led to positive operating leverage these strong second quarter results were driven by our investments in new markets and talent in our footprint supported by our peerleading low cost deposit franchise solid credit performance and old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 ample capital we remain focused on the acceleration of our wealth management treasury management and capital markets businesses before moving to our second quarter highlights i also want to provide you an update on our previously announced partnership with the nashvillebased capstar bank which closed on april and expanded our franchise to several strong and vibrant southeastern markets im pleased to share that last week we successfully completed all banking center and systems conversion for this partnership as of july all former capstar branches have been converted to old national banking centers and all legacy capstar team members are now operating in the old national network the success of our partnership would not have been possible without our team members hard work passion professionalism and collaboration and i want to take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank everyone involved in the integration for a job extremely well done now moving to our second quarter highlights on slide we reported gaap earnings of per common share and our adjusted eps was these adjusted earnings per share results exceeded consensus estimates by or our adjusted return on average tangible common equity for the quarter was and our adjusted roa was our adjusted efficiency ratio was a low excluding deposits and loans assumed in the capstar transaction our total deposit growth was annualized during the quarter and our loan growth was annualized including capstar deposits were up a total of billion and loans were up billion in the quarter our total cost of deposits for the quarter remains at a low basis points at the same time we remain focused on growing our tangible common book value per share which grew from a year ago in summary our second quarter earnings evidenced another strong onplan quarter for old national we exceeded analyst expectations due to our strong deposit franchise disciplined loan growth solid credit quality and ample capital with that ill now turn the call over to john john v moran iv interim chief financial officer chief strategy officer old national bancorp thanks jim turning to slide you can see our second quarter balance sheet which highlights continued stability in our liquidity and our capital position our balance sheet also reflects the close of the capstar transaction on april total deposit growth over the last year has again allowed us to organically fund loan growth while holding borrowings flat additionally we were able to grow our tangible book value per share over the last year given its relative size and our strong retained earnings in the quarter the addition of capstar was essentially capital neutral with our cet1 ratio unchanged despite closing the deal we continue to expect that we will accrete capital at a faster pace than most through the combination of a better than peer return profile and a dividend payout ratio our loan to deposit ratio ticked up modestly due to planned deposit runoff of approximately million at capstar our liquidity and capital levels continue to provide a strong foundation which positions us well as we enter the back half of on slide we show the trend in total loan growth and portfolio yields total loans grew billion with billion attributable to capstar excluding capstar total loans grew annualized from last quarter in line with our expectations we remain focused on full relationships and structure at prices that meet our risk adjusted return requirements new loan production rates in the high range and marginal funding costs in the mid range support our expectation that net interest income will grow modestly for the remainder of the old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 investment portfolio increased in the quarter due to the capstar transaction shortly after closing we repositioned capstar investments which improved our total portfolio yields overall fair values and duration were effectively unchanged as weve mentioned in past calls new money yields continue to run basis points above back book yields and we have approximately billion in cash flows expected over the next months moving to slide we show our trend in total deposits which grew billion with billion attributable to capstar as mentioned earlier we intentionally ran approximately million of higher cost deposits out of capstar at closing excluding capstar total deposits grew annualized with normal seasonal outflows in commercial and retail deposits offset by public fund and broker deposit increases our broker deposits as a percentage of total deposits are and remain well below peer levels we did see a basis point increase in deposit rates compared to the prior quarter with capstar driving approximately basis points of that upward pressure that said deposit costs leveled out at basis points and were steady over the course of the quarter which was consistent with our spot rate at june overall we remain pleased with the execution of our deposit strategy and we believe we are stabilizing with respect to both total cost and the noninterest bearing mix slide provides our quarter end income statement we reported gaap net income applicable to common shares of million or per share reported earnings include the following pretax items million in merger related charges and million of cecl day nonpcd provision expense excluding these items our adjusted earnings per share was moving on to slide we present details of our net interest income and margin spread revenue and margin were both slightly better than forecast primarily due to higher asset yields and accretion our low total deposit cost of basis points remains a key competitive advantage yearoveryear we again showed deposit growth that essentially kept pace with asset generation while maintaining a low total cost of funding on slide we show trends in adjusted noninterest income which was million for the quarter with capstar contributing million our primary fee businesses performed well with bank fees in line with our expectations mortgage benefiting from seasonality and modest improvements in production and pipelines and capital markets returning to more normalized levels continuing to slide we show the trend in adjusted noninterest expenses of million for the quarter with capstar contributing million expenses were in line with our guidance and remain very well controlled on slide we present our credit trends which remained stable reflecting the quality of both our commercial and consumer portfolios the delinquency ratio remained stable and the nonperforming loan ratio decreased basis points total net chargeoffs were basis points and a low basis points excluding basis points related to pcd loans our second quarter allowance for credit losses to total loans including reserve for unfunded commitments was basis points up basis points from the prior quarter there were no material changes to our model assumptions and the weighting on the moodys s3 scenario remains it is also worth mentioning that our allowance for credit losses plus the discount remaining on acquired loans to total loans now stands at basis points slide presents key credit metrics relative to peers as you can see our proactive approach to credit monitoring has led to above peer levels of npls but delinquency and chargeoff ratios that are well below peer averages over long periods of time we have long practiced conservatism here and we believe the results speak for themselves with cre remaining in focus we have enhanced disclosure in this quarters presentation ill turn it over to mark on slide old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 mark g sander president chief operating officer old national bancorp thanks john given the heightened focus on credit and cre in particular this quarter we decided to dive deeper into our loan portfolio and specifically expand on certain segments that we have been watching more closely for some time slide breaks down our billion portfolio which is well diversified across our desired and actual mix of approximately ci which includes owner occupied cre given it is underwritten as ci investor cre and highly rated consumer investor cre of billion is well diversified across subsegments the most noteworthy of which i will talk about in a minute importantly owner occupied cre represents billion of our portfolio with a modest risk profile in line with the rest of our ci book lastly on this page our diversity is reflected geographically across our footprint as well with modest out of market exposures driven almost entirely by inmarket relationships we have presented looks similar to slide many times so to briefly reiterate we believe our pending maturity schedule is extremely manageable we have always stressed our cre loans in underwriting at basis points over current rates such that the vast majority of our pending maturities have interest rates still within that range we have only about million maturing over the next months which are at rates outside of this underwriting cushion and most of those have since seen rent growth well beyond our originally underwritten levels cre office has been a concern industrywide for some time so we thought more color was warranted as seen on slide though sometimes a segment gets painted with the same brush not all office loans are alike with an average loan size of million our portfolio looks a great deal like the picture on the left which is generally lower risk than the one on the right our office exposure is well diversified by loan size and geography the lowest risk segments in the space investment grade tenants andor medical office buildings comprise over of our office exposure and the highest risk segment central business districts less than the credit metrics overall of our office portfolio are strong with an average debt service coverage of nearly times and a weighted average loan to value of as in all of our portfolios we are well disciplined around maximum individual credit exposures in this case the largest is million and the top dropped dramatically from there on slide we cover multifamily our largest segment in investor cre at billion our multifamily lending trends much more towards middle income tenants than class a high rises in major metro markets this book is also welldiversified and granular with an average loan size of just over million overall this asset class remains stable in our markets although prolonged higher interest rates have impacted some more recent projects here again we have strong credit metrics in terms of debt service coverage ratios and loan to values and the portfolio is welldiversified by dollar exposure and location our largest exposures are well within our moderate risk tolerance represent long tenured relationships and tend to have stronger credit metrics ill now turn the call back to john john v moran iv interim chief financial officer chief strategy officer old national bancorp thanks mark on slide we review our capital position at the end of the quarter as expected ratios were essentially unchanged from the first quarter with the impact from the close of the capstar transaction absorbed by strong retained earnings slide includes updated details on our rate risk position and net interest income guidance nii is expected to increase modestly in the third and fourth quarters our assumptions are listed on the slide but i would highlight a few of the primary drivers first we assumed two rate cuts of basis points each consistent with the forward old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 curve second we are now anticipating a declining rate deposit beta of approximately and a noninterest bearing deposit mix that falls to by yearend we continue to believe that we have positioned the balance sheet well as we reach the end of this rate cycle and we have achieved a neutral rate risk position in addition to the twocut scenario we did run a threecut scenario and a static curve through our models the results of each were not materially different from our base case scenario again suggesting we have effectively managed the balance sheet to neutral slide includes thoughts on our outlook for the remaining items of the third quarter and the full year as you can see our guidance is essentially unchanged with a modest increase in nii reflecting this quarters results and a slightly wider provision range that range reflects loan growth and annual chargeoffs that are unchanged although second half chargeoffs are expected to run modestly higher than the basis points we have experienced in the first half we remain comfortable with the full year outlook of to basis points in summary we had an excellent first half of with second quarter results better than our expectations and strong performance metrics more importantly we continue to demonstrate our ability to execute against our strategic priorities first we continue to organically fund our loan growth second our adjusted return profile remains top quartile against peers at on tangible common equity third we remain disciplined on operating expenses with an adjusted efficiency ratio below fourth we have clean credit with nonpcd net chargeoffs of just basis points along with a welldiversified and granular loan book and fifth we are continuing to rapidly compound tangible book value per share which was up yearoveryear with those comments id like to open the call for your questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions your first question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler your line is open r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning everyone james c ryan iii a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp good morning scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co thanks for taking the question hey james c ryan iii a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp good afternoon for you old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co i guess yeah likewise thank you wanted to ask on just sort of the beta assumption maybe john when you think of the down beta maybe just sort of the inside baseball sort of why youre thinking thats the right number and maybe some thoughts on how that would trend after presumably theres some catch up later on as time marches on but just curious how that would sort of flex into as well john v moran iv a interim chief financial officer chief strategy officer old national bancorp yeah thanks scott so i think most of where were going to get the down beta from is really out of the exception price book that book today is billion or so of total deposits of our total transaction deposits and thats at the quarter sort of ph million was the cost on that book and we think well be able to drop that pretty quick i mean i think thatll be close to kind of beta on the way down so thats where most of it will be and then depending on the path the shortterm rates into i think thatll sort of influence what were able to do with the exception price book i think is more about fixed asset repricing though and shape of the curve r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you and then maybe switching gears for a second to the loan growth maybe just a indiscernible on where that growth is coming from i ask sort of in the context of its been a very weak backdrop for the rest of the industry that you all seem to be outperforming maybe sort of where is it coming from and then maybe over the next several months do you see trends getting better or worse and why would that be the case mark g sander a president chief operating officer old national bancorp hey scott its mark the loan growth this quarter was broad across the footprint it was about evenly split between cre and ci cre we had some construction draws that helped boost it a bit and in ci just some of the hires weve made over the last few years in our expansion markets give us some outsized growth and this quarter we had a really nice quarter from our business banking team thats our core business thats full relationships and so its nice to see them grow nearly million this quarter so widely diversified r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect all right thank you for taking the questions james c ryan iii a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp thanks scott operator your next question comes from the line of brendan nosal with hovde group your line is open brendan nosal q analyst hovde group llc old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 hey good morning guys hope youre doing well james c ryan iii a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp thanks brendan good to hear from you brendan nosal q analyst hovde group llc maybe just to start off on kind of the outlook overall at a top level i mean youve broadly reiterated the guide for the rest of this year but it feels like a fair bit has changed environmentally since april especially with respect to the rate outlook and environment i guess im just wondering if you had a bias of feeling better or worse about the outlook youve offered now for the past two quarters where would you folks indiscernible john v moran iv a interim chief financial officer chief strategy officer old national bancorp yeah look i think the balance sheet is neutral so nii i mean weve been saying for a couple of quarters now it doesnt really matter what happens with short rates i think if there were perhaps some room for upside i pointed the fee lines where we continue to invest in wealth management those investments are starting to bear some fruit mortgage is bouncing along the bottom but was seasonally better in than maybe what we would have expected thatd be where i think we might have a little bit of upside to the guide out there brendan nosal q analyst hovde group llc yeah perfect thanks maybe one more from me before i step back can you help us unpack the nii guide for the rest of the year in terms of how you see the margin trending in the back half especially in light of the core margin firming up this quarter john v moran iv a interim chief financial officer chief strategy officer old national bancorp yeah i think its a couple basis points one way or another in third quarter and then fourth quarter wed expect to see things start to improve brendan nosal q analyst hovde group llc all right fantastic thanks for taking the questions james c ryan iii a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp thank you operator your next question comes from the line of jared shaw with barclays your line is open jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc hey good morning old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 james c ryan iii a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp good morning jared jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc maybe just sticking with the nii and margin can you share with us what accretion was this quarter and what the expectation is for accretion as we go into third and fourth quarter john v moran iv a interim chief financial officer chief strategy officer old national bancorp i would say the difference in accretion versus the first and the last quarter was about million that came in from capstar rough top a basis point helper and id expect that to be pretty flat for the balance of this year jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay so stable at this lets call it ph in second quarter john v moran iv a interim chief financial officer chief strategy officer old national bancorp yeah jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay and then any color on credit migration within criticized classified and how youre looking at those trends mark g sander a president chief operating officer old national bancorp right yeah jared its mark again in this quarter we saw about million come in criticized and classified from capstar which is what we expected and then multifamily drove the bulk of the rest of the migration this quarter not unexpected we had some properties with a little lower lease up and so the excess cash flows tightened a bit but we still feel really good about those properties theyre really solid properties strong sponsor support and very low loss content we believe jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay and then looking at the debt service coverage ratio on office it looks like that improved or increased this quarter any color on what was driving that and is that sort of a stable level you think for the category mark g sander a president chief operating officer old national bancorp i think that remains to be seen but we havent seen the deterioration in those ratios to any effect at this point so the best eyesight we have is whats happening right now and it seems to be stabilizing old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of terry mcevoy with stephens your line is open terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good morning everyone james c ryan iii a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp good morning terry good to hear from you terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc same here thanks for slide and i always like pictures maybe question for john can you just yeah i get simple how do you fund to annualized loan growth whats your assumptions on deposit growth use of wholesale funding for  in the back half of the year john v moran iv a interim chief financial officer chief strategy officer old national bancorp yeah certainly terry the mission around here has been for a really long time but we probably got even more focused on it last year we are all deposit gatherers and so certainly the intention would be to fund our asset generation with core deposits and weve been able to do that so far so if you look yearoveryear our asset generation has basically kept pace with our deposit generation that would be the plan going forward to the extent that we have a quarter that deposits are a little bit lighter than the asset generation we have plenty of capacity on brokered and a lot of capacity on wholesale as well if we chose to a and i would just remind you weve said this publicly before but were going to remain on the offense to the extent that there are banks that will continue to be aggressive as rates fall we will remain on the offense and we just believe this is a good longterm play for us so i look forward to that opportunity if it presents itself terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc right thanks for that and from prior conversations youve been real conscious of the tce ratio which is call it i guess my question is where would that ratio need to be today before you think about share repurchase james c ryan iii a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp hey terry this is jim certainly its a tool its a tool were very conscious of clearly the tce ratio is in a better spot post our partnership in chicago obviously the stock price and were sensitive of the earnback and if you look at todays stock price which were very pleased to have that earnback extend out its a little less attractive old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 to us than it once was but i think well just continue to evaluate each day to see if the tool makes sense to use at this point in time though i dont think we need to rush into anything and just let the back half of the year play out terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc and maybe just stepping out of the earnings model could you talk about kind of synergies in the nashville market between wealth and banking and vice versa and maybe retention in that market now that the deal has been closed for three or four months james c ryan iii a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp let me just give you a high level view and ill let mark or ph jim jump in as well i got to tell you i was just down there not too long ago and met with a bunch of different clients were bringing our board meeting down there in august and so were going to have a client event down there with plus clients and have a chance to interact and really talk about the future of nashville the future of the southeast for us and as we just kind of evaluate the opportunities and i continue to be blown away by the opportunities that present themselves to us there obviously are no shortage of good banks that are down there but that doesnt mean we cant go out and compete effectively we got a great team down there theres just so much organic growth which is going to present opportunities for us and while weve always been bullish on that opportunity every single time were down there we get reinforced that opportunities are endless with us in terms of our team members that are down there completely engaged as well as the new business opportunities a retention has been really high terry and its early but i just would say this team is really excited to join old national i think they look at the cultural fit and the capabilities that we bring to the table and theyre excited about and so youre the first part of your question we havent even begun to tap the wealth opportunities that are there this wasnt something that capstar did much of candidly and i think weve got a really strong capability weve got a strong team that was already there if you may recall so both sides of that equation are very excited terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thanks everyone have a great day james c ryan iii a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp thank you terry operator your next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty with kbw your line is open christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 james c ryan iii a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp good morning chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc jim any thoughts of tweaking any exposures in the back half of the year either post deal i mean you dont have a cre problem but theres decent liquidity for certain assets anything thats on the books that might not be core going into james c ryan iii a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp well i think all banks retain a certain amount at its balance sheet thats got flexibility around it and well we have theres no specific plans for us anywhere i think wed need to continually look to optimize the balance sheet and so well need to continue to look at how were able to bring core funding in to support new growth one things for sure were going to continue to acquire new relationships when those relationships are full relationships we have a huge appetite to continue to grow and you can clearly see weve demonstrated that one of the challenges youve followed us for a long time one of the challenges we had in the past was our ability to grow that is clearly not a challenge today weve got great markets great people great growth opportunities ahead of us so to the extent that there are noncore assets that are on the balance sheet or have limited relationships i think there is an opportunity for us to continue to optimize the balance sheet but nothing big or wholesale in nature that would dramatically change what youd expect to see us looking like in the back half of the year but something weve got to continually challenge ourselves to look at christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay perfect maybe dovetailing on the buyback question any change in how youre thinking about strategic ma into i know organic is the focus but any change there would be great james c ryan iii a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp yeah i really dont see why i think there will be plenty of opportunities that present themselves to us in the coming years our appetite i think is i would express is very limited right now i think just given the organic growth opportunities the execution that we have in our core markets and the markets weve added through talent and obviously now in tennessee and north carolina i think we owe it to ourselves and owe it to our shareholders to continue to focus in on that and as weve talked about previously before the idea of compounding tangible book value in a doubledigit clip for the next few years sounds really appealing and really attractive i think ultimately may drive the highest reward for our shareholders christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thanks operator operator instructions your next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc your line is open old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good morning james c ryan iii a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp good morning jon how are you jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey good good maybe start with you john you talked about the high on new origination yields and mid funding costs would you say the new production is margin accretive at this point or is it margin neutral john v moran iv a interim chief financial officer chief strategy officer old national bancorp margin accretive jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay on the deposit costs slide i see that flat deposit cost the at the end of the quarter what do you think that looks like in a quarter or two whats the message youre trying to send or has the pressure stopped john v moran iv a interim chief financial officer chief strategy officer old national bancorp i think the pressure has largely moderated i do think its still competitive out there and again as long as we can continue to do margin accretive business were going to stay on our front foot right so if you were to go out to old nationals website today youd see us running specials that are very competitive i mean we are open for business and were going to fund this bank i think that its moderating the worst of it is clearly behind us could we see a little drift up in third quarter yeah thats possible jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay tying into that the noninterest bearing guide to by the end of the year do you feel like thats it or does that do you think that continues to leak lower naturally or do you feel like were getting to the bottom on that percentage john v moran iv a interim chief financial officer chief strategy officer old national bancorp i think were getting there i think were toward the bottom and part of the secret sauce around here as you know is just the granularity of the book right i mean something like of the relationships here are less than the average on that book is like right at some level theres still probably a little bit of cash sorting that needs to happen but i think were through most of it jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 okay okay and then just to wrap up do you feel like a cut or two isnt necessarily beneficial to your outlook but maybe just the new production is beneficial to the margin outlook is that a fair way to look at it or am i misreading that john v moran iv a interim chief financial officer chief strategy officer old national bancorp yeah no that a fair way to look at it jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay all right thank you very much james c ryan iii a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp thanks jon operator there are no further questions at this time id like to turn the call back to jim ryan for closing remarks james c ryan iii chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp well thank you for your support today as always the team will be here to answer any
