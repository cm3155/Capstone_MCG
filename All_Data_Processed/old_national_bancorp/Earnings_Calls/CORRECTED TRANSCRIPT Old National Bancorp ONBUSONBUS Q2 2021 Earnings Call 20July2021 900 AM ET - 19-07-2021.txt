to share our second quarter results and an update on our recently announced partnership with first midwest bank i would characterize this quarters results as right on plan adjusted earnings per share were when adjusted for specific merger charges onb way cost and debt securities gains during the quarter commercial loans excluding ppp loans grew nicely at our net interest margin was stable capital markets and wealth management revenue were stronger and old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 mortgage revenue was down but consistent with our expectations with a lower pipeline valuation and a smaller gain on sale margin expenses were wellmanaged and slightly higher primarily due to merit increases and higher incentive accruals credit quality metrics remained benign adjusted return on average tangible common equity was a strong and the adjusted efficiency ratio was just under during the quarter we worked hard with our clients on the sba forgiveness process of round loans have been forgiven by the sba and weve already have of round loans through the forgiveness process most of our reported credit quality metrics approved during the quarter we have reduced reserves consistent with our modeling as a result of the better expected economic forecast and the massive stimulus programs we still have approximately of our reserves supported by qualitative adjustments given the higherthanaverage level economic uncertainty that exists today the further we move beyond the pandemics economic shock the more confidence we will have in taking our reserve closer to day one cecl a quick update on hiring we continue to add significant talent during the quarter the cost of the increased investment in talent will start impacting our expenses slightly in the back half of the year our talent pipeline remains strong we have a fantastic story to tell and we have strong interest from new team members wanting to join moving to slide which contains a quick refresher on some of the more salient details of our merger with first midwest i will not bother reading the slide but i will share that im reminded each time that im with our first midwest colleagues how much our cultures are aligned and how strong our strategic fit truly is additionally conversations with investors and sellside analysts confirm they understand and agree with our strategic rationale moving to slide both companies have a tremendous integration history and experience and our work is off to a good start we have made the appropriate sec filings and regulatory applications kendra vanzo and jeff newcom have been appointed to lead the merger integration efforts and we have assembled a group of over team members from both companies to help with the integration we have met with client facing and support team members from both companies and theyre all excited and engaged additionally the management team and outside advisor are deeply involved in making technology selections which we hope to finalize this summer we also expect a special meeting of shareholders to be held in the third quarter for each company and lastly despite the ongoing distraction from the pandemic and now our transformational merger we have remained focused on serving our clients and communities and i think our results illustrate the success of those efforts i will now turn the call over to brendon brendon b falconer senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp thank you jim turning to slide our gaap earnings per share is while our adjusted earnings per share is adjusted earnings exclude million in early mergerrelated charges million in debt securities gains and the last of our onb wayrelated charges of million slide shows the trend in commercial loans and the related commercial pipeline and production trends all excluding the impact of ppp loans  represents our fourth consecutive quarter of organic loan growth and over that year commercial outstandings have grown more than billion  commercial production of billion was the second highest on record resulting in a million increase in outstandings over prior quarter old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 commercial activity continues to be strong throughout the footprint and we are heading into  with a very healthy billion pipeline turning briefly to pricing absolute coupons and new business continues to be impacted by the low rate environment and the high percentage of floating rate versus fixed rate production however spreads and risk adjusted returns are strong and have remained consistent throughout this rate cycle the investment portfolio increased slightly in the quarter as deposit growth once again outpaced total loan growth we are taking a disciplined approach of putting excess liquidity to work in our investment portfolio with new money yields of and a portfolio duration well within five years moving to slide average deposits increased while the growth and periodend balances have moderated total cost of deposits for the quarter was a low basis points a 1basispoint improvement over  next on slide you will see details of our net interest income and margin net interest income increased million quarteroverquarter largely due to our strong commercial loan growth excluding the impact of ppp net interest income increased million which was slightly better than expectations as the impact of earning asset growth more than offset the decline in asset yields net interest margin climbed basis points to from prior quarter primarily due to the low rate environment impact on asset yields core margin excluding accretion and ppp declined just basis points to slide shows trends in adjusted noninterest income adjusted noninterest income was million in  million lower than the million we recorded in the first quarter the decline was primarily driven by lower mortgage banking revenue that was partially offset by quarteroverquarter improvements in all of our other major fee categories decline in mortgage revenues reflects the macro headwinds impacting the industry today while mortgage production was largely flat from  a decline in both the size and value of the secondary pipeline resulted in a million decrease in revenue i would also remind you that  was positively impacted by a million recapture of prior years msr impairment charge next slide shows the trend in adjusted noninterest expenses adjusting for merger charges only related charges and tax credit amortization noninterest expense was million these results were consistent with our expectations and our  guidance turning to ppp loans on slide you will see a rollforward of those balances which stood at million at quarter end we continue to assist ppp clients for forgiveness with approximately of round and of round loans formally through the sba forgiveness process unamortized fees on the remaining ppp loans totaled million we continue to believe that most of the remaining loans will be forgiven and the related fee income recognized in the second half with that i will turn it over to daryl to discuss credit daryl d moore chief credit executive senior executive vice president old national bancorp thank you brendon as weve presented in the past this quarters slide reflects the performance of our loan portfolio both on a current quarter and historical trend basis total 30day delinquencies continue their improving trend for the fourth consecutive quarter falling to basis points at the most recent quarters end as our commercial delinquencies have historically been on the low side the improvement we have seen over the past several quarters has been concentrated in the retail portfolio with lowerthanhistoric delinquency rates in the one to fourfamily residential mortgage indirect auto and heloc portfolios old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 government payments and higher levels of savings due to reduced spending during the pandemic have almost certainly been a contributing factor to the lower retail delinquency numbers while the effect of these payments will diminish over time many of our borrowers will benefit from the child tax credit payments which began last week and will continue at minimum at least through the end of the year with all that being said these extremely low levels of delinquencies are in my opinion unsustainable in the long run net chargeoffs continued wellcontained with the of recovery posted in the quarter while total recoveries were slightly lower than last quarter and at the lowest level posted over last six quarters gross charge offs were less than million which led to the net recovery for the period nonperforming loans fell for the second consecutive quarter mainly on the reduction of nonaccrual loans in the period as you can see the gap between old national and peers in this particular metric has favorably narrowed over the last several quarters we continue to perform well in net chargeoffs and nonperforming measurement category with net chargeoffs as a percent of nonperforming loans being well south of over the last six years this as you can see is significantly lower than peer levels over the time period as a closing comment i would say that the challenges our borrowers are currently facing are much different than what we might have imagined months ago on the ci side the most significant challenges many of our clients seem to be facing are supply shortages and the lack of dependable adequately trained labor additionally we may see impacts on margins going forward with borrowers who are unwilling or unable at the present time to pass along higher input costs to customers on the commercial real estate portfolio front we think all banks continue to watch to see what longterm impacts the pandemic might have on the retail and office portfolio segments with those comments ill turn the call back over to brendon brendon b falconer senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp thank you daryl on slide you will see the details of our second quarter allowance which stands at a million a decline of million from  the improving economic outlook and the positive trends in credit quality supporting modestly lower reserve levels that said we recognize that not all sectors of our economy have recovered and the threat of future covidrelated disruption persists as a result we believe it is prudent to make any largerthannormal qualitative reserve until we have greater clarity on the economic outlook i would also like to remind you that we continue to carry million in unamortized mark from our acquired portfolios while these marks will not directly off net chargeoffs any remaining mark will accrete through margin upon resolution as i wrapup my comments here are some key takeaways we are very pleased with the fundamental results of the quarter doubledigit commercial loan growth led to higher core net interest income despite interest rate headwinds mortgage revenues were down due to pipeline valuation and normalizing margins while all our other fee businesses posted quarteroverquarter improvements expenses remain wellcontrolled and our strong credit quality continues to keep credit cost low slide includes thoughts and our outlook for we ended the quarter with a healthy billion commercial pipeline which supports our favorable outlook on loan growth this historically low interest rate environment will continue to put pressure on net interest income which should be mitigated through continued earning asset growth the ppp loan forgiveness process continued for our round and round clients and we expect runoff of round balances to occur in the latter half of and the recognition of most of the related million in unamortized fees to occur at that time old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 we expect our fee businesses to continue to perform well were encouraged by the momentum in our wealth business and the strong commercial activity should help maintain the high level of performance in our capital markets business while mortgage revenue will continue to follow industry trends current production levels and gain on sale margins should support quarterly revenue consistent with  throughout the remainder of the year our other fee lines are expected to be stable in the near term our outlook on expenses is consistent with our prior guidance we expect a modest increase in the back half of the year as our efforts to attract top revenue talent picks up momentum lastly a brief update on taxes we continue to expect a reduction in the volatility caused by our tax credits as we work through the last of the remaining oneyear historical tax credit commitments in total were expecting approximately million in tax credit amortization for the year with a corresponding full year effective tax rate of approximately with that were happy to answer any questions that you may have and we do have a full team here including jim sandgren and john moran question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from ben gerlinger with hovde group your line is open james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp ben good morning benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc yes good morning guys good morning i was going to start off with just loan growth in general you guys seem to have pretty consistently beat both midwest and national peer growth trends over the past lets call it four quarters or so i know you guys have done a great job getting out in the markets i was wondering if you could shed a little light on to kind of the secret sauce if you will of what old national is doing to not only exceed peers but also have pretty sustainable growth really for the past four quarters james a sandgren a president chief operating officer old national bancorp yeah ben this is jim sandgren i dont know if theres any secret sauce obviously were a strong relationship bank weve been out calling on customers really for the last months while many other banks obviously were working from home and so that provided us an opportunity to serve our clients we brought in a lot of new prospects i think we were pretty opportunistic as other banks might have changed kind of their credit stances so i just think its kind of blocking and tackling being out helping our customers when they need us and so that mentality is carried throughout the year and has certainly helped us as weve started the first half of this year obviously pipelines look good for the back half of the year and so again i think i dont know if theres any secret sauce i think the fact that we restructured through the onb way and aligned skillsets of our relationship managers with the client needs i think thats played a major role as well but i just think its the fact that we are old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 out and building strong relationships and being there for our clients and being opportunistic for those new relationships as well james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp ben i would just add its all hands on deck im going to spend the next two days in northern indiana ill call on clients so its all hands on deck were all locked arms and we continue to believe were doing building quality relationships for the longterm health and success of our company and its a primary focus of our entire leadership team benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc okay great that was a bit of a softball question so the harder one would be your new production yields are a little lower than your net interest margin today and then even though you have a great deposit base and its very low cost i was wondering how you weigh continued growth against the net interest margin every loan you put on should be a little dilutive today indiscernible floating so i was wondering how you manage balance sheet growth relative to maintaining that nim brendon b falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah ben this is brendon yeah weve looked very closely at the pricing we have very strict riskadjusted return hurdles for all of our loans and as i said in my comments earlier our spreads have held in throughout this rate cycle theyve been strong so you think about that floating rate production today relative to libor thats plus basis points over the libor for that floating rate production i think so well continue to put on loans at that rate and feel really good about it benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc okay great i will step back and get in the queue james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp thanks ben operator our next question comes from scott siefers with piper sandler your line is open james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp good morning scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys how are you doing old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp good maybe you didnt get up as early as some others this morning but im hearing from you anyways r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co oh man you just couldnt let it pass could you indiscernible james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp im sorry scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co no worries no ill get up earlier next time honestly there are so many im just thankful that i dialed the right phone number lets see but thanks for taking the question just wanted to sort of followup on the environment for commercial lending i feel like last year you guys capitalized so well some of your larger competitors in particular kind of shutting down for the year to what degree have you noticed that there especially the larger guys are they sort of back in the market in a bigger way number one and then number two how if at all is that impacting the competitive dynamic as you see it james a sandgren a president chief operating officer old national bancorp yes scott this is jim sandgren theres no question that really everyones back in the market now so competitive pressures are certainly heating up again were staying very disciplined as we think about credit structure but were still getting a lot of it back our pipeline i think remains robust as we pointed out so still feeling good about the back half and therell be deals that were going to walk away from because theres certainly some structures out there that are getting stretched and thats okay but overall i think clients feel really good about their opportunities to be successful in the back half of the year and into so its always going to be competitive out there and i think we like our chances given our relationship banking model so r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you and then i guess just a question on the merger so president biden had put out that executive order a couple of weeks ago have you guys seen any impact in discussions with regulators on the approval process i mean the order has kind of left a lot to the imagination so just im curious how the conversations are going and if theres any change visàvis what you might have thought prior to seeing the order james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp no changes no additional feedback from any of our regulators obviously were curious were not sure if it applies to us or maybe our biggest brethren out there so time will only tell as we go through the regulatory approval process but really no indications of any different just full steam ahead old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect all right thank you guys very much i appreciate it james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp thanks scott operator our next question comes from chris mcgratty with kbw your line is open james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp good morning chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey jim how are you doing james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp good christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i wanted to ask about the bond portfolio given the back down the move down in rates lately you are obviously not growing it too dramatically but interested if youre a bit more cautious about growing at near term and maybe what reinvestment rates are today versus the ph million that you gave in the quarter thanks brendon b falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah so well continue to grow that investment fully to the extent we have excess liquidity that we ph cant put to work in the loan portfolio new business rates are probably down a little bit marginally from the average for the quarter but not dramatically so at this point so well continue to be disciplined and our hope is that we continue to grow loans at the pace that were growing and as we talked about the end of year deposits have sort of moderated that growth has moderated a bit so hope is that we can continue to drive a better earning asset mix to the back half of the year christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and on the loan growth historically the origination has been has been quite granular im interested if any of the growth this quarter was a deviation from that or if it continued james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 no its still pretty granular chris i mean average loan new production still continues to grow over time and i think were still just a little bit over i think million so again thats grown over the last few quarters but still fairly granular christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and maybe just one last one for daryl i mean looking at your slide on the reserve im trying to i think were all trying to figure out where reserves bottom with the improvement appreciating that you think around of your reserve is still qualitative do we get to do we breach cecl day this year if the economy continues to improve at the pace it is brendon b falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp hey chris this is brendon ill take that one look what ill tell you is is this credit portfolio is actually a better quality than it was prepandemic at day cecl that said we are going to be very very judicious in bringing that reserve down until we get some clarity around the economic outlook but as we look forward its a possibility and well measure our portfolio on a cecl reserve based on the model when the time comes christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you very much operator our next question comes from terry mcevoy with stephens your line is open james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp good morning terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good morning everyone maybe the first question your outlook for expenses you talk about the investment in new revenuegenerating talent positions im just wondering if you could expand on certain markets where your hiring talent and what areas of the bank james a sandgren a president chief operating officer old national bancorp yeah terry this is jim sandgren were really focusing in really primarily on wealth and commercial and weve added some really good talent in both of those areas and up in the minnesota region weve added some talent in our loan production office there in st louis as well recently added some great talent in louisville so its really across the footprint were being again opportunistic when we can find great talent were adding them to the team and were going to continue to do that james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 i would also add we actually put a couple of key hires in our it and data areas here recently too which is a function of us getting bigger ph us functioning getting better at some of those technology needs and so while its a much smaller part of the total we are investing in some key support areas as well terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thanks and then maybe jim ryan a question for you whats been the feedback from your customers in say michigan indiana and the twin cities where theres just no overlap with first midwest im just curious from their perspective is there any reason for them to expect or worry about change at all or are they may be excited about the merger given what it could bring to the table james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp yeah i think by and large i would characterize as the team members and our clients are excited about the prospects of just being bigger being able to bring more products to the table more services to the table i think everybody is kind of generally excited and obviously we dont know if therell be any impact to those individual clients but i think generally everybody is really excited about the prospects of just being having a bigger balance sheet as well terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc great thank you james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp thanks terry operator our next question comes from jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets your line is open james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey good morning good morning couple of followups on terrys question on some of the new hires youre flagging that as maybe some a bit of an expense headwind later in the year how material do you expect the hiring to be in terms of the expense impact james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp yeah not material im thinking about million to million range per quarter jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 okay james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp its pretty consistent with what we said as we were heading into the year about building that pipeline of talent million to million approximately jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay brendon a question for you or maybe jim on the deposit growth slowing a bit its a little bit different than peers kind of like your loan growth is a little bit different than peers but why do you think that is for you and does that potentially make you a little more optimistic on the ability to hold the nim later in the year if this continues brendon b falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah well see i think the excess liquidity has been sort of certainly outside indiscernible largely driven by stimulus so i know jim and the team are still after their gathering deposits its still a focus of ours but i think the stimulus generates excess liquidity ph seems to be not moderating at least in our footprint and our portfolio today and as i talked about earlier i do think itll be helpful to margin as we are able to put that back to work in the loan portfolio rather than the investment portfolio jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay and is it too simple to say that maybe some of your commercial clients are using some of their deposits and youre seeing some of this maybe pullthrough in terms of loan growth or is it just the stimulus slowdown brendon b falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah and like i said so core deposits still did grow quarteroverquarter just not at the rapid pace that they grew before and actually our business deposits actually grew more than our retail deposits this last quarter ppp funds are starting to get drawn down a bit but were still holding a lot of ppp money still on deposit today jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay and then daryl one for you you touched on commercial real estate retail and office just any changes in terms of youre thinking there any new concerns or any information you can share daryl d moore a chief credit executive senior executive vice president old national bancorp no jon i dont think there are i think that has to play out as leases expire right so youve got people in the office buildings today and in the retail structures that are still paying lease payments the real decision making comes when those leases expire and what they do do they vacate those buildings do they renegotiate much lower rates so were all concerned about watching it but i think weve still got probably months before that all kind of plays out and we see the trends old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc all right thanks for the answers i appreciate it james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp thanks jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah operator operator instructions our next question comes from david long with raymond james your line is open james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp good morning david david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning everyone first question is related to credit and maybe this is more for daryl but as you were going through the process the due diligence process with first midwest im sure you got a look at a lot of their loan book are you having constant discussions with them preclosing about the loan makeup and how theyre thinking about their ratings or is that something that wont really happen until after the deal closes daryl d moore a chief credit executive senior executive vice president old national bancorp yeah david daryl were not having extensive conversations only because as the two banks put their books together there is very very little difference in the way we approach loans and the way we look at risk and so the transition with the two banks is going to be probably as easy as any merger weve done or partnership weve done up to this point in time so were getting policies together were looking at those were tweaking those were communicating a lot but theres not a lot of kind of arm wrestling about youre doing this right youre doing this wrong its just pretty much the same david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it thank you daryl appreciate that and then as far as it spending goes in the near term prior to the close of the deal do you guys adjust how youre spending or how youre thinking about spending and then any changes in your longer term spending strategies once the deal does close brendon b falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah david this is brendon no i think as we talked about in the call i think both banks have really robust it roadmaps were going to continue to complete those roadmaps and make incremental investment where it old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 makes sense as the time goes but no material change in the run rate of our it spend has been contemplated but we think we have plenty of room to invest in some technology investments that will be meaningful to the combined organization going forward james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp yeah david i would just add that the war for talent will continue on our side were going to continue to ramp up talent at all of our markets and especially doubling down in chicago and milwaukee and places like that so ill just add that were going to continue to invest im convinced that the key to our success and our story resonates really well right now and were going to take advantage of that and make sure we invest in a lot of great talent david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it thank you guys appreciate it operator there are no further questions at this time james c ryan chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp well great again we appreciate all your support and as always were here to answer any questions when you have followup
