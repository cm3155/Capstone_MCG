review our fourth quarter and full year results im going to start on slide number im incredibly proud of the way our company and teammates responded during these challenging times this past year presented one of the most complex operating environments in our companys history as covid cases accelerated across all states and that led to considerable uncertainty about the health and welfare of millions of people and businesses the fiscal and monetary response from the government combined with the private sector actions providing relief to those impacted was necessary and still remains critically important to the recovery across our country we also confronted the harsh realities of social injustices and racial disparity requiring difficult but necessary dialogue and an intensified call to action for everyone sadly covid appears to be further accelerating these disparities as i shared across our company and with our board the only way we permanently disrupt the flaws in our system is by each individual making the commitment to change now and after the headlines were less frequent and candidly thats part of the reason i share it again today while the year was full of

distribution corporate finance has tripled in size to billion through prudent entry into additional verticals and weve grown capitalefficient mortgage and investment securities portfolios and added ally lending we expect continued organic loan growth and return optimization moving forward ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 the second driver has been the transformation of our funding profile shown in the bottom left where deposit growth and retention have increased stability and reduced cost of funds since our deposit portfolio has nearly doubled to billion now representing of overall funding as a result higher cost legacy unsecured debt has declined by and weve reduced reliance on other wholesale funding including securitizations facilities and other borrowings and third optimization of retail auto portfolio yields where weve consistently generated improved riskadjusted returns through expanding dealer relationships and increased application flow fullyear new origination yields exceeded for the third consecutive year even as benchmark rates have declined to basis points over the past two years our consistent pricing reflects the strength of the retail auto asset class and our leading competitive position across both sides of our balance sheet we have reduced nim volatility by managing to a relatively neutral interest rate risk management position which is evidenced in stable fullyear net interest margin from here we expect sustained revenue and margin expansion a key differentiator for ally lets turn to slide to review

expansion of over will drive net financing revenue growth in the midteens yearoveryear adjusting for significant items other revenue will steadily grow fueled by our broader set of consumer offerings and ongoing insurance expansion and as a reminder we embed modest investment gains in our outlook these factors will drive ppnr expansion and positive operating leverage as revenue growth outpaces expenses based on pandemicrelated uncertainty reflected in our reserves we expect ncos to peak in before stabilizing in and ill close by reiterating the gratitude and pride i have in our ally teammates who drove our results and positioned us for success by doing it right for our customers communities and our shareholders and with that ill turn it back to jb jeffrey jonathan brown chief

ally financial inc ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 thank you jb operator please begin the qa session question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from ryan nash with goldman sachs your line is now open ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc thanks good morning everyone jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc good morning jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc good morning ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc so maybe to just dig in a little bit more on the rotce progression so jb jenn the bank is clearly benefiting from the environment as well as investments that youve made in the business and bringing down funding costs optimizing on the asset side so can you maybe just dig in a little bit more on the drivers of getting us to returns and i think more importantly can you talk about the ability to sustain these returns particularly as the interest rate environment may evolve over time and what are some of the drivers to doing that jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure appreciate the question ryan ill jump in and jb may want to add but the progression to the mid teens rotce i think you described it really well it will be revenuedriven positive operating leverage i just mentioned the nii trajectory next year which will be progressing into the midteens coupled with the fact that well continue to see other revenue expand over time minus some of those onetimes so when you wrap that all up were expecting total revenue next year to be around or so and so really nice positive operating leverage driven by that revenue growth coupled with the fact that on the credit side we do expect that to migrate more towards normalized levels as we exit and into and so those are some of the big dynamics there i would absolutely expect that the is sustainable and i think thats due to all of the drivers that we kind of just described this morning around consistent customer growth continued value add across every one of our businesses we dont see any signs of stopping in the auto segment continuing to groom relationships grow relationships deals per relationship and just our positioning in the market couldnt be any better than it is today and we dont see any sign of that stopping over the next several years ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 you slide over to the deposit business and you look at the years of sustained customer growth and really the transition from customers that were chasing price to really now customers that have bought into the digital transformation covid has certainly helped with that but i do think that is a permanent shift in customer just propensity to purchase digitally and with cashrich balance sheets across direct banks as well as the entire industry i dont think were going to see a lot of appetite around increased pricing on the deposit side and then last but certainly not least just the rapid scaling that weve seen in our newer customer segments every one of our newer customer segments is up 70plus percent this quarter and you just continue to see that added value and the added ability for us to diversify our revenue into these higher return products whether thats ally lending our invest product as well as mortgage as well so maybe a longwinded answer but bottom line here is really confident in getting to that in short order and sustaining it over the long term ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it thanks for all the color and maybe if i can dig in a little bit further on the credit expectations so jenn a couple of things i think you mentioned decline in used car prices unemployment ending above and i also think you mentioned that chargeoffs are going to peak in so can you just give us a little bit more color on where you see chargeoffs headed and then second i think you said that you think losses are returning to more normal levels in and what is embedded in the reserve in the 12plus returns in terms of where the reserve is headed is there any assumptions of reserve releases and how long would you expect until we actually get back to that precovid level on the reserve front jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah so ryan maybe let me start with some of the assumptions around reserves and then ill get to the mco trajectory but its embedded in our reserves and you were listening really well you pretty much captured it we have a pretty adverse macroeconomic scenario embedded in our modeling so we use a november forecast were exiting at about unemployment rate it might break down to just above at the end of this year and because we have a short rns forecast we will revert to a mean thats over in unemployment so yeah there is definitely some adversity built into that macroeconomic forecast ill also remind you that we have not built any stimulus benefits into our reserve trajectory so if you think about stimulus that has already been rolled out but new stimulus potentially on the horizon as well as the fact that consumer spending has dropped and were seeing savings rates at really alltime high level or highest levels weve seen in recent future so embedded in our reserve is a lot of kind of conservative assumptions and so i do think depending on macros depending on the continued performance of the consumer there could be some upside if we continue to roll through so thats some context around the reserve embedded in those reserves we have ncos really starting to accelerate in the first quarter second quarter of this year and peaking in  and  before returning to more normalized levels into and so bottom line here is we are well reserved weve taken the pain through the income statement in could potentially be some upside as you think about macrooutperformance and consumer outperformance and then last but not least we do not model any kind of reserve releases in our forecast that the reserve level will migrate down as we run through ncos assuming that the projections play out as i just described ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it thanks for all the color jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc sure thank you ryan operator thank you our next question comes from moshe orenbuch with credit suisse your line is now open moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks and that set of answers actually answers a lot of the questions but maybe we could drill down a little bit into on the deposit side or the funding side i mean one of the things that weve talked about over the years is both optimizing your mix of funding overall and then your kind of deposit pricing and some of the comments that you made sounded like you think thats relatively near given the liquidity at yourselves and some of your peers could you just talk about the opportunities there and what that could mean to your cost of funds jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure thank you for the question moshe so a couple things just first on the cost of funds trajectory i think this quarter is a really nice reflection of what were expecting to see as we continue to roll through and which is that cost of funds will migrate down it reflects a couple of things the full run rate impact of the osa reductions this year the cd repricing that will continue throughout and you think about cds are rolling off at and rolling back on at material levels under and then to your point on other funding sources the excess cash we have on the opposite side of the balance sheet will be used in part to kind of replace fhlb our broker deposits weve terminated our demand notes programs and we havent been active in the ads markets either so we see other sources of funding rolling down at the same time we continue to see overall deposit growth and pricing move down as well so hopefully that gives you a bit of color moshe just on what were expecting but i think this quarter kind of really summarizes it perfectly and wed expect that trajectory to continue moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc got it and i mean i think the you made a very strong point about the impact of the margin on revenue growth in but it does sound like theres some of that that extends kind of beyond and provides further lift even if there are some elements of current profitability that are kind of better than normal jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah absolutely moshe this is a trend that wed expect over the next several quarters and then your first question you did kind of allude to market pricing i mean we have cashrich balance sheets across the direct bank liability stocks have been optimized and so theres not a i dont believe theres a whole lot of appetite across the industry to see pricing increases in or beyond and of course thats the dynamic around loan ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 growth as well but we feel confident in our pricing and the ability to continue to take down funding costs beyond moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc thanks jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you moshe operator thank you our next question comes from betsy graseck with morgan stanley your line is now open betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc morning betsy jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay one quick followup and then a separate question but the rate environment that youre looking for could you just help us understand just using the forwardcurve results what is embedded in your outlook and if rates move higher does that materially change your thoughts around nim jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah betsy a couple of things so were not embedding any rate increases into our projections right now but the interesting thing is if you do consider a rise and more rapidly rising rate environment were really confident in continuing to hit these higher nim levels and thats all of the dynamics that we have on pricing in auto on the asset side as well as in deposits we think will be persistent in almost any rate environment i mean you never want to say that but as we look at a variety of different rate forecasts we continue to see that nim will increase just because of the strength of the pricing we have on both sides of the balance sheet betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay so youre saying that if the short end starts moving up that you can maintain the spread relative to what youre getting on the auto side ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah i mean i think if we do see rates rise i think itll be a positive on the asset side if you think about libor based commercial floorplan and i think if anything if you see any interest rate increases across the curve thats only a net positive for some of our longerduration assets like investment securities or auto book mortgage et cetera betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then just separately on loan demand and the portfolio and how its been migrating maybe you can give us just some sense on what youre seeing on the ground demand for both used and new asking the question because one of the pushbacks i get on ph every call on ally is well eventually everyone is going to have one two or three cars whatever they need so shouldnt loan demand pull back so a little color on that and if you could give us a sense as to how the portfolio has been migrating from a credit perspective in the various buckets prime non nearprime subprime i asked that question because the other pushback i get is how used car prices are so strong thats why credit is doing so well when used car prices start to stabilize or come down slightly yearonyear youre going to see the credit quality come through and i just wanted to get your sense as to what youre seeing there so we can better address those questions were getting from investors thanks jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc okay sure thanks betsy a lot in there let me try to tackle it one at a time i mean i think on auto what id direct you to is the performance and our exit run rate in terms of volumes in terms of pricing continues to persist and we really dont see that stopping and a couple of dynamics there one is certainly covid is helping weve seen a shift in spend from services to durables and the whole environment around covid impact on appetite for ride share or mass transit has obviously really spurred demand for personal vehicle ownership so that is a net plus but i will say just the resiliency of consumer balance sheets the high savings rates above and beyond that dynamic there is demand that has persisted kind of pretty much off the charts the second thing that i would say is if you look at just this market its a very large and fragmented market and we have differentiated capabilities and we see in kind of any environment the ability to continue to grow dealers dealer relationships increase apps per dealer and continue to persist in terms of both originations as well as pricing and then lastly keep in mind our forecast and our forecast in and beyond does not embed a whole lot of growth i mean were we have i think achievable assumptions in our guide were guiding towards this mid billion or billion in originations and were assuming that pricing actually comes down about basis points so i really think theres strong demand in this environment i think theres persistent opportunity for us because of our model and last but not least the guide does not have really aggressive assumptions and then on your questions on credit betsy just a couple of things that id say there id say the entire book is really performing much better than expected and thats kind of all cycle band all areas of the book were not seeing any kind of issues in particular customer segments its really been broadbased outperformance ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 and on your question on vehicle prices losses will be reflective of frequency as well as severity if you look at frequency youll see delinquencies across 30plus down over 50plus continues to come down as well and so frequency metrics are all trending very strong and then on a severity well see i mean we are expecting a decline of about in used vehicle prices in i think theres a bull case around outperforming that most of it is in the decline is in the back half of but as i said if theres persistent demand for new and used i think we could outperform that but that is again built into the guide and as i described in response to ryans question theres a lot of moving pieces and parts around credit but im not overly worried about the severity side of it betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc so then when were looking at the net chargeoffs that should come with what youre baking in for unemployment and the down in auto does that get us to kind of a normalized loss rate of to or is that kind of a decent range or do you have a different outcome jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah so this year we are expecting ncos or weve modeled ncos to increase above that level our reserve is at as i mentioned earlier were expecting ncos to really start accelerating more reflective of frequency versus severity here in the first half and really peaking in  and  and betsy with the reserve level that those ncos are higher than that number now as we exit we would absolutely expect ncos to migrate back into that more normalized range of kind of to that youve seen historically but we do have those pandemicrelated ncos accelerating here in and potentially room to outperform that betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay thank you appreciate the color jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you so much betsy operator thank you our next question comes from sanjay sakhrani with kbw your line is now open sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning i wanted to follow up on some of the questions and comments before maybe just focusing on the auto yields those have been pretty resilient suggesting it could be worse i guess maybe you guys could talk about the competition there and the environment is there something different about this environment where youre not seeing a lot of competitive pressure on those yields and then maybe just broadly in terms of thinking about the risks to the targets that you guys have provided taking the economy aside what are those risks jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 okay so a couple of things there just in terms of auto yields and competition i mean sanjay as you know this is always a really competitive space and i think everyone is seeing kind of the performance of this asset class through and its been one of the stronger across the consumers so competition is always strong i think we could see some more competition heading throughout here but in the belly of the curve where were playing we continue to see a lot of opportunity to grow and to put price in the market but we are mindful of that and thats why we have baked in kind of a 50basispoint reduction in retail auto origination pricing this year when i talk to the team heading here in january i think theyre really pleased with what they saw exiting and even more pleased with what theyre seeing at the outset here in and then second just with inventory levels continuing to be pressured and really pressured here starting the first quarter because of the strong demand i described i think used vehicle pricing and pricing overall will remain strong and then sorry jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc on the risks indiscernible jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc oh risk okay risk to the forecast okay sanjay i think if we reflect on i think if we learned anything its that things can change very rapidly and so what i would say the big risk for us is just to be mindful of this environment i mean we have a lot of changing political landscape changes potentially to the tax rate to regulation to consumer spend consumer behavior i mean i think we felt was quite a roller coaster ride and i mean i think were incredibly wellpositioned to navigate any environment and our performance this year demonstrated that but were mindful of potential volatility to come and that would be the biggest risk if we did see anything but i think as i reflect great performance this year really wellpositioned for next year and a variety of rate environments i think weve established a strong reserve so feel really good about where we are but just want to be mindful of the environment sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i think you guys have done a great job just a followup on ma just curious jb any thoughts on where there might be opportunities if there are opportunities i know consumer lending has been a focus at points in time i mean is that something youre looking to get larger in thanks jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc yeah i mean sanjay id say we really like the position of the existing businesses and the state of the company right now and obviously jenn and i announced the with our board announced the large capital return program so i think in the short term were more kind of hunkered down focused on scaling our the existing businesses and the newer businesses longer term i think as we have said for quite some time i mean the unsecured space we think fits well with the overall consumer position of ally we like the asset class we think it can generate the right types of returns but we got to be smart on that and so i think in the near term its more kind of head down focus on what we have inhouse today but you always sort of stay open to things to come so nothing imminent though ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc thanks sanjay jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc thanks sanjay operator thank you our next question comes from bill carcache with wolfe research your line is now open bill carcache q analyst wolfe research thank you good morning everyone jb im sorry if i missed this i was in a different call but i had a bigpicture question for you allys net interest margin performance during the rate hike cycle that started in late and what weve seen from you guys so far in this indiscernible environment along with the strong credit performance of positive operating leverage and the rotce trajectory that you guys have laid out it feels like were setting up for the investment community to gain greater comfort with the through the cycle performance of auto as an asset class so the ability for you guys to deliver on the guidance you laid out is obviously critical but could you kind of characterize that as beatable or aspirational maybe just give us a sense of how much conviction you guys have just overall highlevel thoughts would be helpful jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc sure bill thanks for the question and obviously jenn can go through any of the details on it but i think inside the house we have this kind of pound to outperform mentality that exists so i think jenn has highlighted whats embedded in the forecast so i think obviously we put the 12plus and thats our focus really continue driving strong disciplined execution and i think what youre really starting to see come through now in the results is a function of the past several years of work and very disciplined execution the businesses scaling really strong positions so we feel really good about the state of the company now and the sustainability of earnings and certainly as you pointed out the margin is going to be a big component of that and jenn hit all the highlights of several years of kind of 7plus percent yields on the asset side and youre starting to still see the book migrate up to these new origination yields at a time when deposit costs and funding costs overall continue to come down and jenn and her team i just cant say it enough what our treasury team and jenn has been doing to continue optimizing the liability structure i mean weve been very aggressive there the past couple of quarters obviously in trades weve done on the fhlb side which just further gives us confidence and strength going forward so i mean its been its really been fun and energizing to see the company starting to really strut its stuff but weve got a high degree of confidence in kind of what were going to be able to deliver going forward jenn obviously youve got the details so ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc jb i think youve summarized that extremely well and maybe i just offer two points to add on one is bill on the pricing side a lot of that as jb just summarized is already embedded right so weve got front book backbook repricing dynamics in retail auto and theres kind of no stopping that and similarly on the deposit side the trajectory to come really reflects that robust positioning that we have across the entire liability stuff so a lot of that is kind of hard coded into our metrics and our forecast and then on the reserve i think i mentioned in prior question just theres a lot of assumptions in there that are fairly adverse and so our view today is that weve taken the pain our reserves have peaked and so potentially there could be some upside there and then to your question around kind of throughthecycle performance on auto were not projecting any change to kind of our day one cecl assumptions as reserves normalize and so if we continue to outperform at this level potentially there could be some kind of just reverse rating of the entire asset class again not embedded in the forecast bill carcache q analyst wolfe research got it thanks jenn thanks jb thats very helpful separately theres been a lot of focus on dealer floorplan levels taking longer to return back to historical levels and just hoping that you could comment on how you guys are thinking about the risk that dealers will be running with less inventory than they have historically jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc yeah i bill carcache q analyst wolfe research or do we revert jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc yeah bill i guess our base case sort of calls for a slow reversion to more normalized levels and obviously youll see some offset in our cash balance positions when that starts to happen but i think the real reality is its been much slower than the industry expected to see now obviously thats impacted used car pricing and used car strength in the used car market overall so while you dont have as many new cars on the lot the demand by consumers still remains its still very strong and so they continue to shift and use so i think our base forecast sort of calls for that slow factory ramp back up more new cars on lot and thats creating a little bit of the more softer used car pricing that used car prices that jenn alluded to but were still a ways away i mean while we did see some modest improvement i think under billion quarteroverquarter were a long way from kind of the 30plus billion levels that we would have expected in a normal environment bill carcache q analyst wolfe research ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 got it thank you for taking my questions jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc thank you bill jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you bill operator thank you our next question comes from rick shane with jpmorgan your line is now open richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey guys thanks for taking my question when we look at the day one reserve level to today theres basically a 60basispoint addition when you think about the duration of the loans that equates to about basis points a year on an annualized chargeoff on nco rate given that there has been substantial amortization in the portfolio since weve entered the covid scenario cumulative losses are way below original expectations and at this point essentially about of the book has been underwritten in a postcovid environment is there a huge disconnect between the macro assumptions that you guys are using to set the cecl reserve and the actual sort of bottomsup experience that youre really seeing in the portfolio jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah rick appreciate your very welldone summary there absolutely i mean we are seeing a disconnect across macroeconomic factors and the servicing performance whether you look at 30plus 60plus or for the loss metrics that being said we continue to operate in an environment of uncertainty and so as i described earlier weve been prudent and balanced around setting a reserve using the historical correlations to the macros and not embedding a lot of stimulus to your point i do think there could be some upside should a the macros continue to outperform because they have been outperforming and b if consumers continue to be as resilient as they proven to be through and thats some of the upside not only on the reserves but also on the nco trajectory i described earlier richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great yeah i like the terminology of correlation to macros because thats a lot of what we try to do and ill agree with you it has not been nearly as predictive as it has been in the past jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah ally financial inc ally
