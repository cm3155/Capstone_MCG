strong third quarter results we generated core pretax earnings of billion for the third consecutive quarter net financing revenue excluding oid of billion reached the highest level on record for the second consecutive quarter growing yearoveryear our nii and nim expansion trajectory continues to be powered by stable earning asset yields reflecting accretive retail auto trends and elevated used car values further enhanced by optimized funding costs as the benefits of core deposit growth permanently reduce our dependence on highercost alternatives our balance sheet uniquely positions us to overcome the headwinds of a flat rate curve adjusted other revenue was million reflecting another solid quarter of investment gains and diversified revenues from smartauction ally home invest and insurance as indicated last quarter we repositioned million of oid expense associated with the retirement of our trust preferred securities provision expense of million increased seasonally remaining wellbelow normalized levels as overall credit performance remains exceptionally strong noninterest expense of just over billion reflected a continued focus on essentialism across the enterprise as

payment trends and improved loss given default rates we expect full year retail ncos in the to 40basis point range well below the to range we underwrite to and reserve against as weve noted on several occasions our financial outlook contemplates a steady migration back to normalized levels by though this could be extended given the continued strength of the consumer in the bottom right early and

retail auto point of sale and mortgage portfolios retail auto coverage of moved lower by basis points quarteroverquarter as trends generally improved across consumer health and macroeconomic measures

growing within each annual vintage underlying growth in our multiproduct relationships continued in the quarter offset by our ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 practice of removing accounts with limited or no activity over a sixmonth timeframe which we believe is a more accurate portrayal of engaged active customers this impacted our reported multirelationship metric but excluding this adjustment we observed net growth for the 18th consecutive quarter which we expect to continue moving forward turning to slide we grew customers and balances across all our digital bank platforms weve acquired customers at a cagr over the past decade cultivating loyalty and satisfaction and expanded relationships through our convenient straightforward offerings ally invest and ally home continue to derive significant account and volume activity from existing depositors while the steady expansion of ally lendings point of sale offering remains a bright spot for growth in a rapidly expanding market our formula for success positions us well as we add credit card in the months ahead moving to slide auto segment pretax income of million reflected the strong platform weve built over many years and was driven by net financing revenue growth from ongoing optimization in the consumer portfolio and strong use values expansion of smartauction and clearpath and solid credit performance retail portfolio trends shown in the bottom right highlight the continued strength in riskadjusted margin trends driven by solid origination yields and nco performance turning to slide we constantly adapt to dealer and customer needs evidenced in our multiyear growth of dealer relationships and our ability to source and originate loans in a competitive environment in the upper left we surpassed dealers who purchased one or more of our auto products across consumer and commercial lending smartauction and commercial services lending an important differentiator for ally as we deepen relationships in the upper right ending consumer assets expanded to billion driven by retail and lease portfolio growth average commercial balances ended at billion as industry inventory set a new multi decade low driven by strong consumer demand and supply chain constraints we continue to see broadbased health among dealers evidenced in strong profitability due in part to lower inventory carry costs and strong demand and pricing for available supply auto originations of billion represented our highest third quarter since while weve

weve included our financial outlook again this quarter rotce for excluding reserve releases will exceed reflecting strong ppnr trends and solid credit performance weve also layered in the return expansion we expect to generate in and associated with the acquisition of fair square as i noted earlier weve captured upside opportunities in a uniquely strong environment were operating in this year importantly our enhanced and sustained return profile in the midteens provides a clear view of our broader objectives and significant progress these results will be fueled by revenuedriven ppnr expansion reflected in the mid to upper nim outlook and diversified other revenue generated among our established and broadened consumer offerings as a reminder we assume modest investment gain activity but will remain opportunistic in the years ahead our outlook incorporates balanced competitive and operating environment assumptions including normalized trends across used car prices credit and deposit pricing were confident in our ability to continue driving near and longterm benefits for all of our stakeholders and with that ill turn it back to jb jeffrey jonathan brown chief executive officer director ally financial inc thank you jenn ill close with a few comments on slide number our results remain strong our purpose and cause resolute and the outlook for continued success remains clear and achievable we built a compelling growth company upon the foundations of disciplined execution and clear prioritization of meeting customer needs for differentiated products and services with the new exciting chapter of growth now in front of us we will continue to execute with a focus on the same values and priorities that have served us well over several years and with that daniel back to you and we can head into qa daniel eller headinvestor relations ally financial inc thanks jb so as we head into the qa ill ask participants to limit yourself to one question and one followup operator ill turn it over to you to begin the qa ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 question and answer section operator our first question comes from bill carcache with wolfe research bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thanks good morning appreciate you taking my questions jb and jenn i wanted to jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc morning bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc good morning id like to followup on your comments on all the detail you provided on the fair square deal its certainly smaller and more digital in nature than the prior deal that you guys had announced does this provide you with enough of a platform to organically build out the credit card business or should we just think of it as sort of a starting point that youd look to add through other inorganic opportunities over time and in terms of outlook the to basis points seems like certainly quite impressive but given that the card business is i guess such a highroe business it would seem like there could be if it continues to grow there could be some longerterm potential for greater accretion to the extent that you guys continue to grow that business would love to hear your thoughts around that jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure good morning bill ill jump in and jb may want to add so first on your question around the platform so fair square is through the jcurve and theyve established four meaningful products and you can see how successful theyve been with those products with 60plus active account growth and over loan growth and so bringing them into the ally ecosystem really just gives them more fuel to scale what theyve already built and we have very high confidence that they continue to grow at these levels and ill also note that we have not included synergies across kind of the whole broader millionplus customers that we have within the four walls of ally here so the short answer to your question is yes their platform is absolutely poised for growth and you can see that in their historic results and were expecting to see continued growth out in the future and then relative to the accretion this is a kind of business that takes some painful growth math just with cecl so we could certainly increase and accelerate the accretion on both eps as well as rotce in the nearterm but the tradeoff bill quite frankly would be longerterm accretion over time so we want to give them access to liquidity and capital to grow as quickly as they can were very confident in the to basis points of rotce in the next couple of years but that also takes into consideration ph the growth math on cecl which we could toggle up and down but we really just want to focus on the longterm here and jb i dont know if you want to add anything ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc i mean jenn i think you framed it perfectly i mean bill the other thing id just say obviously really no surprise that card has been an area of interest for us and so weve examined it a lot and thought about it a lot but this was also a really really good management team these are card experts grew up in card wanted to do something out on their own but theres a lot of really strong foundations and industry expertise that sits within the leadership team and so i think all sides are really excited about what this can mean going forward but as jenn said were pleased really about the state of the business today but i think we see much broader opportunities to scale this business up going forward bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc that makes a lot of sense and its very helpful thank you if i could followup separately with another different question on funding understanding that you want to continue to offer a healthy premium on deposits relative to the more traditional banks but how significant does that premium need to be is there still some room for your cost of interestbearing deposits to continue to migrate lower from here and then by extension i know you said jenn mid to upper nim but is it fair to say that theres a bias towards the upper end of that range if you could give some thoughts on that thank you jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure so on the funding side bill youre absolutely right theres a long runway to continue to bring down the overall cost of funds for ally below and i talked about the nine consecutive quarters that weve had of lower funding costs and that will continue as we head into and as youre pointing out really fuel that nim expansion and a lot of that is related to cds were repricing that the industry and the sector has largely kind of floored osa at about basis points but we still have cds rolling down and then outside of deposits we still have opportunities to rationalize mix and cost so youll see a long runway there and then just in terms of the overall nim there is an upside case there and so weve been guiding towards kind of to and i think with the acquisition of fair square it gives us some additional nim tailwind here so i think there absolutely could be an upward bias to the high as we head into and beyond bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats really helpful thank you for taking my questions jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you bill jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc thanks bill operator our next question comes from sanjay sakhrani with kbw ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey guys i wanted to my first question is just followingup on fair square i was wondering if you could just talk about how you expect to focus that business sort of the end markets today are in that fico band range that you guys mentioned on the slide but do you envision to go more upmarket jenn you talked about crossselling it potentially to your customers and would that bring down the roa of the business maybe you could just talk about that and maybe also tie that into some of your other consumer finance lending initiatives thanks jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc sure yeah so thanks for the question sanjay so first on the target market theyve largely been focused on a middleclass customer so think about a customer without a income in that fico average level and what theyve seen there is a largely underserved market and thats why theyve been able to grow so aggressively through a difficult card environment and so priority number one is to allow them to keep their focus on that segment and on the unique opportunities they have to grow and then above and beyond that we do think that they have full spectrum underwriting capabilities with their digital platforms theyre datadriven capabilities we do believe that they have the capabilities to go more broadbased and full spectrum as i mentioned we havent modeled that into the impacts that weve provided this morning but that would be upside opportunity and then just as you think about that roa weve contemplated some growth scenarios there and if we did go upmarket there could be a little bit more pressure on net roa but overall should be very accretive to ally if you think about where were running today and as we think about that crosssell its certainly in the bank but opportunities within the auto segment as well so were really thinking about bringing this product on into the broader ally ecosystem and not only do we think that theres crosssell of card but as we generate more card growth theres opportunity to crosssell some of our other products into the card business so a lot of opportunities here i think weve been pretty modest in the projections weve provided and were really excited sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then just a followup turning to the auto business maybe you could just talk about how might be setting up from an origination standpoint obviously stellantis has might be establishing its own captive so youve got some more competition there maybe just broadly speak on the setup and you have the supply chain issues so i dont know if anything has changed in your outlook but if you could provide some guidance that would be great jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure and sanjay i think we kind of highlighted in our prepared remarks how strong auto continues to perform with highest application flow weve seen in years highest origination flow for a third quarter continuing to see really strong pricing with yields at and fullyear at so you can see just in our performance that the market is continuing to perform and our position in the market is performing as we look into and well provide a lot more detail as we get into january but were still expecting to see really robust application flow and robust originations likely in that billion maybe not quite to billion so there could be some modest reduction but overall auto continues to perform exceptionally well and we dont see any signs of that stopping based on market trends but also our position in the market continues to strengthen with our 12th consecutive year of growing dealers as well as continued increase in that app flow so feeling really good about that ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc and sanjay maybe the only thing id add obviously stellantis sort of doing what they did i dont think that realistically presents any change for us any time soon i mean longterm could there be implications perhaps but obviously our focus is on taking care of the dealers we have incredibly strong dealer relationships so yeah i see the rationale of why they did what they did but i dont think it really changes anything from what were thinking about in terms of originations or relationships for any time soon sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc you got it thank you jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you sanjay operator our next question comes from rob wildhack with autonomous research robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research good morning everyone one more on fair square the run rate roa you highlighted in the slide does that take into account the cost of funds benefit from being a part of ally and what kind of credit environment is considered in that number jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah good morning rob it does take into consideration a lower cost of funds as we bring fair square into ally so theres some synergies there we overall think that is a very reasonable number just as we grow the portfolio and again it doesnt include a lot of synergies that we see from a growth and a revenue perspective robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research okay and should we just consider like a normalized credit environment as the underlying assumption there jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah on the credit environment they have been outperforming i think similar to other players in the industry we would expect that to normalize kind of into a to range over time and we do include all the cecl math in the guide that weve provided the transaction highlights here but we would expect that to normalize rob from where they are today simply with the outperformance ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research got it and then on the floor plan business was the decline this quarter in line with your expectations and when you say lower through the later part of is that a meaningful decline from here or do you think were near indiscernible jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah i mean rob every time we think weve kind of plateaued we decline a bit more so now floor plan is under billion its down about on a yearoveryear basis and thats due to all of the supply chain constraints and the complexities around chips but its also reflective of a very strong consumer and so demand is also driving the inventory levels lower i will say i think late early is when we would expect that to normalize and i think some of the chip dynamics could be sorted out i think the big question is how strong demand will be as we continue into and and just to reiterate we have not built any kind of natural hedge upside that we have in used vehicle values and lgd in our credit as you look at that guide so to the extent that floor plans stays lower consumer stays stronger if anything rob theres upside to the guide that we provided in and jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc and rob maybe the only just touch to add i mean what were hearing from a lot of the dealers right now certainly a lot of the big names theyre presold four to five months out on new cars coming in and so to jenns point thats just going to keep this continued pressure on inventories growing anytime soon robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research thats very helpful thank you jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you rob operator our next question comes from betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc good morning jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc hi betsy ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc really interesting acquisition wanted to just dig in to the excess capital point you were making so the acquisition is taking up about i think you mentioned a quarter of your excess capital so as we jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc think about how do you think about the rest is this hey were going to hold on to it because were going to grow this card portfolio at a rapid at a decent clip so we want to hold some of that or youre generating a lot of excess capital every quarter so do we take the rest and buy it back or is it held for some of this continuation of the retail auto loan growth just want to understand how youre thinking about that at this stage jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah betsy and youre right its of our excess capital and i think the short answer is its all of the above were going to continue to organically grow the balance sheet and thats really across every single one of our portfolios its retail auto it leases and to the floor plan question that will come back over time were going to grow our ally lending business well grow fair square and our credit card business and so its really all of the above its first and foremost continuing to serve our customers and grow our balance sheet and then youve seen that weve distributed significant amounts of capital through buybacks and the dividend and well continue to look to distribute capital in that regard as well its really a full portfolio of opportunities that we have ahead of us and were not in a hurry we still have a great rotce guide without rushing to deploy that capital but really no change to how were thinking about our overall priorities on capital allocation betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i guess the reason i asked the question is theres been some thought that you would use the capital strategically in this manner and now that you have the card acquisition when it closes its done and dusted do you hold the excess capital or do you get to that optimized capital level that capital ratio that youve got as a target i ask because youre generating a lot of excess capital every quarter and really i suppose the underlying question is can you fund your growth with your earnings or do you want to lean into growth more aggressively by holding that excess capital to fund it i guess thats really the question jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah yeah i mean its a great question and were working through that as we go through our strategic plan right now and youre right the of the excess is actually three months of earnings that were deploying through this acquisition and so theres still a lot of dry powder here and were pushing every one of our businesses to think about growth in a different way think about unconstrained growth think about how we can be more creative and innovative in the marketplace and its not only growing our balance sheet its looking at technology investments marketing investments and just to your point betsy really taking a look at where the opportunities are and smartly deploying that capital so we increase growth and returns its a great question we will work ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 through this capital i mean this is of our excess and as we grow through the next few years we will work through it its just going to take a bit of time betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and if i could just get one more in on mortgage i know you have that bettercom relationship wondering if you could speak to how you think thats going to impact you as we migrate from refiheavy to more purchaseskewed mortgage environment jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah betsy the relationship is going very well and you saw that we had our highest origination flow this quarter in the history of our mortgage business and were really finding that that digital platform and the strong customer value and nps scores are resonating across a wide variety of consumers in terms of the shift from refi to purchase i think that presents opportunities for us we have a very agile platform and i think if anything what you see is more of a shift to hfi just with higher ticket purchases and seeing a strong consumer especially at the highend and more of a shift to hfi is what were seeing right now but we really think that were wellpositioned as we head into a purchase market simply because of the strong value proposition that we provide betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it thank you jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc thanks betsy jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc thanks betsy operator our next question comes from rick shane with jpmorgan richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks guys for taking my questions this morning id like to talk a little bit about the competitive environment on the origination side historically when sales are soft we see the captives come in and basically subsidize financing im curious if youre seeing any effort by the captives right now to basically capture premium as a way to enhance their economics in an environment where supply and demand of new cars is so out of whack and then also to followup on that are you seeing any entrance from sort of the private equity world given the really compelling economics in auto finance at the moment jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah ill start and jb you may want to jump in here but just on your question on captives rick were actually seeing incentives come down because car demand is so high that they havent needed to provide any subsidies ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 and to jbs point the backlog and people are purchasing cars out kind of to months from now so they havent needed to provide those incentives or those rebates to really create that demand because demand is so strong so the short answer your question is no were not seeing that just in terms of the overall environment including private equity we havent seen any major shifts there and i think thats because we play predominantly in that prime segment and jb made the comment last quarter that its kind of boring in our segment it is kind of boring i mean were the number one lender in prime we have a very high strategic moat around our business because you need very sophisticated underwriting and servicing capabilities its hard to enter its kind of outside of the risk profile of more of the regional bank model and so we just continue to see very strong application flow and ability to originate in that space and it hasnt been disrupted from movement around captives or private equity and last but not least were really seeing dealers thrive in this end market and the percent of profitable dealers is kind of 95plus and so not only are we seeing strength in ally but all of the 20000plus relationships that we have with the dealers are also very strong richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey jenn if i can reframe that question slightly so i totally understand that incentives are way way down im just curious when dealers look particularly franchise dealers when dealers look at their economics and they can make money selling cars they can make money financing cars im just curious if they are steering more towards captive finances way to actually pick up some of the economics that they just cant fully capture on retail pricing at this point jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah no and in fact its hard to do that right now simply because theres not a lot of new vehicles most captive financing is around new vehicles if you look at just even the percent used that weve generated its the highest level in history from a dollar and percent perspective and so as dealers are leaning more into used its actually become harder for them to generate income from captive financing which is largely again around the new vehicles yeah robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research that totally makes sense thank you so much jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you rick jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc thanks rick operator our next question comes from moshe orenbuch of credit suisse jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 moshe youre maybe on mute if youre out there daniel eller a headinvestor relations ally financial inc operator lets move to the next in the queue well come back to moshe operator okay our next question comes from kevin barker with piper sandler kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co good morning thanks for taking my questions i just wanted to followup again on fair square i mean you mentioned a run rate roa which implies it seems maybe million to million of earnings and then you outlined also its accretive to return on equity in of to basis points which would imply well over million in earnings can you reconcile how you would get to the run rate earnings today versus the guidance for over basis points of roe expansion out in maybe jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah thanks kevin for the question so on the rotce the deal is actually immediately accretive simply because were putting of our excess capital to work so theres a denominator effect there on the rotce so think about day one were accretive as you look at eps it takes just a little bit longer and well start to see eps accretion in kind of the back half of and then as we indicated for full year but thats essentially the different its the denominator effect on the cet1 kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co okay and then when you think about the potential earnback from this acquisition whats your estimated earn back on tangible book value given the earnings outlook that you see today jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah and so this kinds of comes back to the cecl math question so the earnback could be very quick if we werent growing up but based on our focus on growth kevin itll probably take about five years to achieve the book value earnback and again thats simply because we upfront a lot of cecl costs as were growing the card portfolio but we really think that we acquired a growth company at kind of a value earnback period even within the kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co i would assume that you thought i mean i would assume that the earnback you would theoretically have on a buildout versus a purchase was a lot longer is that the assessment that you made that you rather purchase the capabilities and utilize the management team thats in place rather than build out a potential card product is that right jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 yeah absolutely we really think we got the best of everything here kevin because were buying a company thats largely through the jcurve it makes sense for them to be part of a bank as they think about scaling leveraging funding synergies leveraging our brand our million customer ecosystem it makes perfect sense for them to kind of come inside the four walls of a bank makes perfect sense for us because the painful part of the j curve is over and so we can acquire a growth company without having to pay huge multiples of book and we can still accrete eps in short order so like i said i really feel like we bought a growth company with a more mature company kind of earnback period and again this is three months of earnings and about a quarter of our excess capital so we feel great about the investment that weve made and you kind of heard some of the earlier questions around well what else are you going to do what are the other opportunities to grow and we feel like this was a great step to advance our growth and our earnings rotce trajectory kevin kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co okay thank you jenn jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you operator our next question comes from john pancari with evercore isi john pancari q analyst evercore group llc good morning jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc good morning jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc good morning john pancari q analyst evercore group llc i wanted to see if i can get a little more color on your auto expectations i heard you in terms of the production expectation that you mentioned to sanjay how would you think that would interpret into auto loan outstandings as you look at and then separately around your auto price assumption and your retail auto yield curious how youre thinking about that as you look at thanks jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah and strong origination translates into strong balance sheet growth and so just as youre seeing retail auto outstandings grow we would expect that into and beyond john and the same on lease right were seeing really strong originations in the lease space so we would expect both our loan and lease retail auto portfolio to grow at really robust yields ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 i mean this will be our fourth year in a row at yields were not seeing a lot of pressure on pricing right now so were not going to give a specific guide just yet but id say the trends are really positive around continued origination strong origination flows outstanding balance growth at robust pricing and then on the commercial side thats where theres a bit more of a question mark in terms of when does that actually turn jb had mentioned late and i think the positive there is we have all these natural hedges from an income statement perspective so its a net positive either way for us but feeling really good about the outstanding growth to your question as well as robust yields going forward and by the way in our guide for and we are modeling much more normalized expectations versus what im sharing right now so if anything theres a bit of an upside there john pancari q analyst evercore group llc got it okay thanks and then as you look at the nonauto businesses ultimately when we do see the auto picture begin to moderate how would you characterize where you think the best growth prospects exist right now within ally to help offset the abatement that you could see on the top line as auto begins to normalize further out thanks jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you you just actually explained the fair square acquisition right there but i mean we see really robust growth opportunities across every single one of our portfolios and you see mortgage really picking up thats refinanced but also purchase and well see that mix shift but well see strong balance sheet and gain on sale margin opportunities in mortgage definitely the unsecured space is one that were seeing robust growth we had our highest originations in ally lending this quarter seeing really strong opportunities in retail as we scale that further scale our home improvement vertical and healthcare in ally lending fair square obviously offers us robust growth opportunities in addition to ally lending and corporate finance continues to be a steady grower so this whole notion of diversification is what weve been focused on and were really pleased this year to see every one of our businesses scaling up ahead of expectations and a really bright future ahead not only for our existing businesses but fair square as we bring them on as well john pancari q analyst evercore group llc great
