and analysis ally financial inc form 10k automotive financing volume our automotive finance operations provide automotive financing services to consumers and automotive dealers and retailers for consumers we provide retail financing and leasing for new and used vehicles and through our commercial automotive financing operations we fund dealer purchases of new and used vehicles through wholesale floorplan financing and provide dealer term and revolving loans and automotive fleet financing acquisition and underwriting our consumer underwriting process is focused on multidimensional risk factors and data driven riskadjusted probabilities that are continuously monitored and routinely updated each application is placed into an analytical category based on specific aspects of the applicants credit profile and loan structure we then evaluate the application by applying a proprietary credit scoring algorithm tailored to its applicable category inputs into this algorithm include but are not limited to proprietary scores and deal structure variables such as ltv new or used vehicle collateral and term of financing the output of the algorithm is used to sort applications into various credit tiers s a b c d and e credit tiers help determine our primary indication of credit quality and pricing and are also communicated to the dealer that submitted the application this process is built on long established credit risk fundamentals to determine both the applicants ability and willingness to repay while advances in excess of of the vehicle collateral value at loan originationnotwithstanding cash down and vehicle trade in valueare typical in the industry primarily due to additional costs such as mechanical warranty contracts taxes license and title fees our pricing risk and underwriting processes are rooted in statistical analysis to manage this risk our underwriting process uses a combination of automated strategies and manual evaluation by an experienced team of dedicated underwriters continued advancements in our datadriven risk assessment process have allowed us to methodically increase our use of automated credit decisioning in recent years this increase in automated decisioning has enhanced the buying experience for our dealer and consumer customers through improved response times and more consistent credit decisions underwriting is also governed by our credit policies which set forth guidelines such as acceptable transaction parameters and verification requirements for higherrisk approved transactions these guidelines require verification of details such as applicant income and employment through documentation provided by the applicant or other data sources we continue to monitor loss performance across the risk spectrum which enables us to implement risk mitigation strategies including pricing increments and curtailment actions on underperforming microsegments underwriters have a limited ability to approve exceptions to the guidelines in our credit policies for example an exception may be approved to allow a term or a ratio of paymenttoincome debttoincome or ltv greater than that in the guidelines exceptions must be approved by underwriters with appropriate approval authority and generally are based on compensating factors we monitor exceptions with the goal of limiting them to a small portion of approved applications and originated loans and rarely permit more than a single exception to avoid layered risk consumer automotive financing new and usedvehicle consumer financing through dealerships takes one of two forms retail installment sales contracts retail contracts and operating lease contracts we purchase retail contracts for new and used vehicles and operating lease contracts from dealers after those contracts are executed by the dealers and the consumers our consumer automotive financing operations generate revenue primarily through finance charges on retail contracts and rental payments on operating lease contracts in connection with operating lease contracts we recognize depreciation expense on the vehicle over the operating lease contract period and we may also recognize a gain or loss on the remarketing of the vehicle at the end of the lease the amount we pay a dealer for a retail contract is based on the rate of finance charge agreed by the dealer and customer the negotiated purchase price of the vehicle any other products such as service contracts less any vehicle tradein value any down payment from the consumer and any available automotive manufacturer incentives under the retail contract the consumer is obligated to make payments in an amount equal to the purchase price of the vehicle less any tradein or down payment plus finance charges at a rate negotiated between the consumer and the dealer in addition the consumer is responsible for charges related to pastdue payments consistent with industry practice when we purchase the retail contract we pay the dealer at a rate discounted below the rate agreed by the dealer and the consumer generally described in the industry as the buy rate our agreements with dealers limit the amount of the discount that we will accept although we do not own the vehicles that we finance through retail contracts our agreements require that we hold a perfected security interest in those vehicles we set our buy rates using a granular riskbased methodology factoring in several variables including interest costs projected net average annualized loss rates at the time of origination anticipated operating costs and targeted return on equity our underwriting capabilities allow us to manage our risk tolerance levels to quickly react to major changes in the economy over the past several years we have continued to focus on optimizing pricing relative to market interest rates as well as portfolio diversification and the usedvehicle segment primarily through franchised dealers and automotive retailers which has contributed to higher yields on our consumer automotive loan portfolio commensurate with this shift in origination mix we continue to maintain disciplined underwriting within our new and used consumer automotive loan originations managements discussion and analysis ally financial inc form 10k with respect to consumer leasing we purchase operating lease contracts and the associated vehicles from dealerships after those contracts are executed by the dealers and the consumers the amount we pay a dealer for an operating lease contract is based on the negotiated price for the vehicle less any vehicle tradein any down payment from the consumer and any available automotive manufacturer incentives under an operating lease the consumer is obligated to make payments in amounts equal to the amount by which the negotiated purchase price of the vehicle less any tradein value down payment or any available manufacturer incentives exceeds the contract residual value including residual support of the vehicle at lease termination plus operating lease rental charges the consumer is also generally responsible for charges related to pastdue payments excess mileage excessive wear and tear and certain disposal fees where applicable at contract inception we determine pricing based on the projected residual value of the leased vehicle this evaluation is primarily based on a proprietary model which includes variables such as vehicle age expected mileage seasonality segment factors vehicle type economic indicators production cycle automotive manufacturer incentives and shifts in used vehicle supply this internally generated data is compared against thirdparty independent data for reasonableness periodically we revise the projected value of the leased vehicle at termination based on thencurrent market conditions and adjust depreciation expense if appropriate over the remaining life of the contract upon termination of the lease lessees generally have the ability to exercise a purchase option at the stated contractual amount if the lessee declines to exercise the purchase option the dealer then has the ability to buy out the vehicle if neither the lessee or dealer completes the buyout the vehicle is returned to us and we remarket the vehicle at termination our actual sales proceeds from remarketing the vehicle may be higher or lower than the estimated residual value resulting in a gain or loss on remarketing recorded through depreciation expense our standard consumer operating lease contract smartlease requires a monthly payment by the consumer we also offer an alternative leasing plan smartlease plus which requires one upfront payment of all operating lease amounts at the time the consumer takes possession of the vehicle our standard consumer lease contracts are operating leases therefore credit losses on the operating lease portfolio are not as significant as losses on retail contracts because lease credit losses are primarily limited to pastdue payments and assessed fees since some of these fees are not assessed until the vehicle is returned these losses on the operating lease portfolio are correlated with lease termination volume operating lease accounts over days past due represented and of the portfolio at december and respectively with respect to all financed vehicles whether subject to a retail contract or an operating lease contract we require that property damage insurance be obtained by the consumer in addition for operating lease contracts we require that bodily injury collision and comprehensive

marketing incentives automotive manufacturers may elect to sponsor incentive programs on retail contracts and operating leases by subsidizing finance rates below market rates these marketing incentives are also referred to as rate support or subvention when an automotive manufacturer subsidizes the finance rate we are compensated at contract inception for the present value of the difference between the manufacturersupported customer rate and our standard rate for a retail contract we defer and recognize this amount as a yield adjustment over the life of the contract for an operating lease contract this payment reduces our cost basis in the underlying operating lease asset automotive manufacturers may also elect to sponsor incentives referred to as residual support on operating leases when an automotive manufacturer provides residual support we receive payment at contract inception that increases the contractual operating lease residual value resulting in a lower operating lease payment from the customer the payment received from the automotive manufacturer reduces our cost basis in the underlying operating lease asset other operating lease incentive programs sponsored by automotive manufacturers may be made at contract inception indirectly through dealers which also reduces our cost basis in the underlying operating lease asset under what the automotive finance industry refers to as pullahead programs consumers may be encouraged by the manufacturer to terminate operating leases early in conjunction with the acquisition of a new vehicle as part of these programs we may waive all or a portion of the customers remaining payment obligation under most programs the automotive manufacturer compensates us for a portion of the foregone revenue from the waived payments this compensation may be partially offset to the extent that our remarketing sales proceeds are higher than otherwise would be realized if the vehicle had been remarketed upon contract maturity servicing we have historically serviced all retail contracts and operating leases we originated including a small amount of retail contracts originated as heldforsale on occasion we have sold a portion of the retail contracts we originated through wholeloan sales and securitizations but generally retained the right to service and earn a servicing fee for our servicing functions as of december we serviced of our consumer automotive loan portfolio servicing activities consist largely of collecting and processing customer payments responding to customer concerns and inquiries processing customer requests including those for payoff quotes totalloss handling and payment modifications maintaining a perfected security interest in the financed vehicle engaging in collections activity and disposing of offlease and repossessed vehicles servicing activities are generally consistent across our automotive finance operations however certain practices may be influenced by state laws our customers have the option to receive monthly billing statements and remit payment by mail or through electronic fund transfers or to establish online webbased account administration through ally auto online services customer payments are processed by regional thirdparty processing centers that electronically transfer payment information to customers accounts collections activity includes initiating contact with customers who fail to comply with the terms of the retail contract or operating lease agreement by sending reminder notices or contacting customers via various channels when an account becomes to days past due the type of collection treatment and level of intensity increases as the account becomes more delinquent the nature and timing of these activities depend on the repayment risk of the account during the collections process we may offer a payment extension to a customer experiencing temporary financial difficulty a payment extension enables the customer to delay monthly payments for or days extensions granted to a customer typically do not exceed days in the aggregate during any 12month period or days in aggregate over the life of the contract during the extension period finance charges continue to accrue if the customers financial difficulty is not temporary but we believe the customer is willing and able to repay their loan at a lower payment amount we may offer to modify the remaining obligation through a rewrite extending the term and lowering the interest rate in the event of a rewrite the outstanding balance generally remains unchanged the use of extensions and other modifications help us mitigate financial loss extensions may assist in cases where we believe the customer will recover from shortterm financial difficulty and resume regularly scheduled payments modifications may also be utilized in cases where we believe customers can fulfill the obligation with lower payments over a longer period before offering an extension or modification we evaluate and take into account the capacity of the customer to meet the revised payment terms we generally do not consider extensions that fall within our policy guidelines to represent more than an insignificant delay in payment and therefore they are not considered loan modifications for reporting purposes although the granting of an extension could delay the eventual chargeoff of an account typically we are able to repossess and sell the related collateral thereby mitigating the loss at both december and december of the total amount outstanding in the servicing portfolio had been granted an extension or was rewritten subject to legal considerations we generally begin repossession activity once an account is at least days past due repossession may occur earlier if we determine the customer is unwilling to pay the vehicle is in danger of being damaged or hidden or the customer voluntarily surrenders the vehicle we assign accounts to approved thirdparty repossession vendors who handle the repossession activity on our behalf any disruptions in the repossession process could impact our ability to timely or successfully repossess the vehicle generally after repossession the customer is given a period of time to redeem the vehicle or reinstate the contract by paying off the account or bringing the account current respectively if the vehicle is not redeemed or the contract is not reinstated the vehicle is sold at auction generally the proceeds do not cover the unpaid balance including unpaid earned finance charges and allowable expenses and the resulting deficiency is chargedoff asset recovery centers pursue collections on accounts that have been chargedoff including those accounts where the vehicle was repossessed and skip

operating lease we assume ownership of the vehicle from the dealer neither the consumer nor the dealer is responsible for the value of the vehicle at the time of lease termination when vehicles are not purchased by customers or the receiving dealer at scheduled lease termination the vehicle is returned to us for remarketing we generally bear the risk of loss to the extent the value of a leased vehicle upon remarketing is below the expected residual value conversely we may recognize a remarketing gain when the proceeds from a returned vehicle are greater than the expected residual value our ability to efficiently process and effectively market offlease vehicles affects the disposal costs and the proceeds realized from vehicle sales our methods of vehicle sales at lease termination primarily include the following sale to lessee the lessee has the first opportunity to purchase the offlease vehicle at the end of the lease term for the price stated in the lease agreement which equals the contract residual value determined at origination sale to dealer after the lessee declines an option to purchase the offlease vehicle the dealer who accepts it has the opportunity to purchase it directly from us at a price we define internet auctions once the lessee and the dealer decline to purchase the offlease vehicle we offer it to dealers and other third parties through our proprietary internet site smartauction through smartauction we seek to maximize the net sales proceeds from an offlease vehicle by reducing the time between vehicle return and ultimate disposition reducing holding costs and broadening the number of prospective buyers we use smartauction for our own vehicles and make it available for thirdparty use we earn a service fee for every thirdparty vehicle sold through smartauction which includes the cost of clearguard coverage our protection product designed to assist in minimizing the risk to dealers of arbitration claims for eligible vehicles in approximately vehicles were sold through smartauction as compared to approximately in physical auctions we dispose of an offlease vehicle not purchased at termination by the lessee or dealer or sold on smartauction through traditional thirdparty physical auctions we are responsible for handling decisions at the auction including arranging for inspections authorizing repairs and reconditioning and determining whether bids received at auction should be accepted we employ an internal team including statisticians to manage our analysis of projected used vehicle values and

platform internet vs physical and evaluating our residual risk on a realtime basis this team tracks market movements of used vehicles using data down to the vin level including trim and options vehicle age mileage and seasonality factors that we feel are more relevant than other published indices for example manheim nada this analysis includes vehicles sold on our smartauction platform as well as vehicles sold through manheim adesa and over independent physical auction sites we believe this analysis gives us a competitive advantage over our peers commercial automotive financing automotive wholesale dealer financing one of the most important aspects of our dealer relationships is providing wholesale floorplan financing for new and usedvehicle inventories at dealerships wholesale floorplan financing including syndicated loan arrangements represents the largest portion of our commercial automotive financing business and is the primary source of funding for dealers purchases of new and used vehicles wholesale floorplan financing is generally extended in the form of lines of credit to individual dealers these lines of credit are secured by the vehicles financed and all other vehicle inventory which provide strong collateral protection in the event of dealership default additional collateral for example blanket lien over all dealership assets or other credit enhancements for example personal guarantees from dealership owners are generally obtained to further mitigate credit risk furthermore in some cases we may benefit from situations where an automotive manufacturer repurchases vehicles these repurchases may serve as an additional layer of protection in the event of repossession of dealership newvehicle inventory or dealership franchise termination the amount we advance to dealers for a new vehicle is equal to of the manufacturers wholesale invoice price subject to payment curtailment schedules the amount we advance to dealers for a used vehicle is typically of the dealers cost of acquiring it interest on wholesale floorplan financing is generally payable monthly the majority of wholesale floorplan financing is structured to yield interest at a floating rate indexed to the prime rate the rate for a particular dealer is based on among other things competitive factors the size of the account and the dealers creditworthiness additionally under our ally dealer rewards program dealers benefit in certain circumstances from wholesalefloorplanfinancing incentives which we pay and account for as a reduction to interest income in the period

includes consumer credit risk commercial credit risk and counterparty credit risk credit risk is a major source of potential economic loss to us credit risk is monitored by the executive leadership team and our associates and is regularly reported to and reviewed with the rc management oversees credit decisioning account servicing activities and creditriskmanagement processes and manages credit risk exposures within our risk appetite in addition our loan review group provides an independent assessment of the quality of our credit portfolios and creditriskmanagement practices and reports its findings to the rc on a regular basis to mitigate risk we have implemented specific policies and practices across business lines utilizing both qualitative and quantitative analyses this reflects our commitment to maintaining an independent and ongoing assessment of credit risk and credit quality our policies require an objective and timely assessment of the overall quality of the consumer and commercial loan and operating lease portfolios this includes the identification of relevant trends that affect the collectability of the portfolios microsegments of the portfolios that are potential problem areas loans and operating leases with potential credit weaknesses and the assessment of the adequacy of internal credit risk policies and procedures our consumer and commercial loan and operating lease portfolios are subject to periodic stress tests which include economic scenarios whose severity mirrors those developed and distributed by the frb to assess how the portfolios may perform in a severe economic managements discussion and analysis ally financial inc form 10k downturn in addition we establish and maintain underwriting policies and limits across our portfolios and higher risk segments for example nonprime based on our risk appetite another important aspect to managing credit risk involves the need to carefully monitor and manage the performance and pricing of our loan products with the aim of generating appropriate riskadjusted returns when considering pricing various granular riskbased factors are considered such as expected loss rates loss volatility anticipated operating costs and targeted returns on equity we carefully monitor credit losses and trends in credit losses relative to expected credit losses at contract inception we closely monitor our loan performance and profitability in light of forecasted economic conditions and manage credit risk and expectations of losses in the portfolio we manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the borrower the source of repayment the underlying collateral and current market and economic conditions we monitor the credit risk profile of individual borrowers various segmentations for example geographic region product type industry segment as well as the aggregate portfolio we perform quarterly analyses of the consumer automotive consumer mortgage consumer other and commercial portfolios to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses based on historical current and anticipated trends refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information additionally we utilize numerous collection strategies to mitigate loss and provide ongoing support to customers in financial distress we have enhanced our collection strategies to include customized messaging digital communication and proactive monitoring of vendor performance we may offer several types of assistance to aid our customers based on their willingness and ability to repay their loan as part of certain programs we offer loan modifications to qualified borrowers including payment extensions interest rate concessions and principal forgiveness furthermore we manage our credit exposure to financial counterparties based on the risk profile of the counterparty within our policies we have established standards and requirements for managing counterparty risk exposures in a safe and sound manner counterparty credit risk is derived from multiple exposure types including derivatives securities trading securities financing transactions lending arrangements and certain cash balances for more information on derivative counterparty credit risk refer to note to the consolidated financial statements we employ an internal team of economists to enhance our planning and forecasting capabilities this team conducts industry and market research monitors economic risks and helps support various forms of scenario planning this group closely monitors macroeconomic trends

pressures used vehicle and housing prices unemployment levels real personal income household savings and their impact on our borrowers additionally our consumer credit exposure is significantly concentrated in automotive lending credit risk management for the consumer loan portfolio begins with the initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrowers credit life cycle we manage consumer credit risk through our loan origination and underwriting policies and the credit approval process we use proprietary creditscoring models to differentiate the expected default rates of credit applicants enabling us to better evaluate credit applications for approval and to tailor the pricing and financing structure according to this assessment of credit risk we continue to monitor loss performance across the risk spectrum which enables us to implement risk mitigation strategies including pricing increments and curtailment actions on underperforming microsegments we continuously monitor and routinely update the inputs of the credit scoring models these and other actions mitigate but do not eliminate credit risk ineffective evaluations of a borrowers creditworthiness fraud or changes in the applicants financial condition after approval could negatively affect the quality of our portfolio resulting in loan losses our servicing activities are another important factor in managing consumer credit risk servicing activities consist of collecting and processing customer payments responding to customer concerns and inquiries processing customer requests including those for payoff quotes totalloss handling and payment modifications maintaining a perfected security interest in the financed vehicle engaging in collections activity and disposing of offlease and repossessed vehicles servicing activities are generally consistent across our automotive finance operations however certain practices may be influenced by state laws during the year ended december the credit

information insuranceunderwriting risk underwriting risk represents the risk of loss or of adverse change in the value of insurance liabilities due to inadequate pricing and reserving assumptions insurance risk also includes event risk which is synonymous with pure risk or hazard risk and presents no chance of gain only of loss the underwriting of our products or the assumption of insurance risk through reinsurance includes an assessment of the risk to determine acceptability and categorization for appropriate pricing the acceptability of a particular risk is based on expected losses expenses and other factors specific to the product in question for example with respect to vscs considerations include the quality of the vehicles produced the price of replacement parts repair labor rates and new model introductions with respect to our vehicle inventory insurance product considerations include the dealers loss history and loss control practices as well as the geographic exposure to weather events and natural disasters among other factors we also assume risks through reinsurance arrangements where a managing general agent or third party provides certain functions for an insurance product or program which may include but is not limited to premium and claims administration and reporting binding of policies and other customer servicing functions or underwriting services in exchange for a commission where underwriting and risk acceptance is delegated to third parties we will consider the appropriateness of the third partys underwriting guidelines and their ability to evaluate and assess risks within the context of those guidelines and routinely monitor arrangements with such parties to support risk mitigation activities we utilize a system of controls and governance including the use of a risk appetite framework to govern the amount and types of insurance risks we take including the consideration of concentration risks volatility of products and a number of other factors we also utilize a new product committee reserving committee underwriting committee and risk management committee to monitor manage and mitigate insurance risks including consideration of pricing adequacy and risk of unfavorable loss development we mitigate the risk of losses by the active management of claim settlement activities using experienced claims personnel and the evaluation of current period reported claims losses for these events may be compared to prior claims experience expected claims or loss expenses from similar incidents to assess the reasonableness of incurred losses for business assumed through reinsurance we may rely on third parties for claim adjudication or the estimation of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses reliance on third parties inherently includes certain risks and uncertainties that are unique relative to our direct insurance lines of business which may include lags in reporting or different assessments of reserve adequacy in order to mitigate such risks we regularly review the performance of such business assumed through reinsurance and our carried loss reserves may differ from reserves reported to us from third parties if deemed appropriate managements discussion and analysis ally financial inc form 10k in some instances reinsurance is used to reduce the risk associated with volatile business lines such as catastrophe risk in vehicle inventory insurance our vehicle inventory insurance product is covered by aggregate excessofloss protection which provides coverage for the accumulation of weatherrelated losses that exceed predetermined retention levels in addition loss control techniques such as storm path monitoring to assist dealers in preparing for severe weather help to mitigate loss potential the level of reinsurance utilized will depend on the assessment of market pricing for such protection the size and composition of our insured risks and our overall risk appetite in certain cases we choose not to obtain reinsurance protection if the cost is perceived to outweigh the benefits of such protection in accordance with industry and accounting practices and applicable insurance laws and regulatory requirements we maintain loss reserves for reported losses losses incurred but not reported loss adjustment expenses and unearned premium reserves for contracts in force the adequacy of our estimated reserves and changes to the estimated values of reserves are routinely monitored by credentialed actuaries our reserves are regularly reviewed by management and subject to various governance and controls however since the reserves are estimates based on numerous assumptions the ultimate liability may differ from the amount estimated market risk our financing investing and insurance activities give rise to market risk or the potential change in the value of our assets including securities assets heldforsale loans and operating leases and liabilities

primarily credit and liquidity risk of an instrument generally an increase in spreads would result in a decrease in fair value measurement we are also exposed to marginal foreigncurrency risk primarily from canadian denominated assets and liabilities we enter into foreign currency hedges to mitigate foreign exchange risk we have exposure to changes in the value of equity securities with

manage the interest rate risk of our financial instruments the execution of our current business strategy generally results in shorterduration fixedrate consumer automotive loans comprising the majority of our assets and liquid floatingrate retail deposits comprising the majority of our liabilities this in turn results in a structurally liability sensitive balance sheet as our floatingrate retail deposits reprice faster than our fixedrate consumer automotive loans when interest rates change we prepare forwardlooking baseline forecasts of pretax net financing revenue as well as anticipated future business growth actions to alter our assetliability positioning and interest rates based on the implied forward curve the analysis is highly dependent upon a variety of assumptions one of the most significant being the repricing characteristics of retail deposits with both contractual and noncontractual maturities we monitor industry and competitive repricing activity along with other business and market factors when developing deposit pricing assumptions modeled simulations are then used to assess changes in pretax net financing revenue in multiple interest rate scenarios relative to the baseline forecast the changes in net financing revenue relative to the baseline are defined as the sensitivity our simulations incorporate contractual cash flows and assumed repricing characteristics for assets liabilities and offbalance sheet exposures and incorporate the assumed effects of changing interest rates on the prepayment and attrition rates of certain assets and liabilities our simulations do not assume any specific future actions are taken to mitigate the impacts of changing interest rates these simulations measure the potential changes in our pretax net financing revenue over the following months we test a number of alternative rate scenarios including immediate and gradual parallel shocks to the implied forward curve we also evaluate nonparallel shocks to interest rates and stresses to certain term points on the yield curve in isolation to capture and monitor a variety of risks simulation results are driven by underlying models and assumptions that are based on trend behavior and other historical information the underlying models and assumptions including retail deposit pricing are regularly monitored and evaluated and may be updated accordingly as observed trends materialize as a result if future trends or behaviors deviate from those reflected in the models actual sensitivities may varyperhaps significantlyfrom those that are modeled for example the pace and magnitude of changes in the federalfunds rate during the last two years has challenged models like ours whose historical data is largely derived from a more stable rate environment during the fourth quarter of we updated our liquid deposit repricing assumptions increasing our liability sensitivity to instantaneous rate increases actual sensitivities may differ for other reasons as well including unplanned changes in balance sheet composition timing of asset and liability repricing the yield curve customer behavior macroeconomic conditions the competitive environment and management strategies accordingly we do not treat the sensitivities as forecasts of net financing revenue but instead use them as a tool in managing interest rate risk in a stable rate scenario that assumes spot rates as of december remain constant through the simulation net financing revenue over the next months is expected to increase by million versus the baseline forecast due to the shape of the implied forward curve managements discussion and analysis ally financial inc form 10k the following table presents the pretax dollar impact to baseline forecasted net

instantaneous change in interest rates in millions in millions basis points basis points basis points table end a gradual changes in interest rates are recognized over months since december the implied forward curve has further inverted as market expectations of shortterm rates have increased during our floatingrate commercial balances and cash balances increased and we saw a shift from liquid deposits to cds additionally we increased our payfixed swap position and incrementally added interest rate floor contracts that will provide benefit in certain lowerrate scenarios the impact of these changes is reflected in our baseline net financing revenue forecast as of december we view the balance sheet as being modestly assetsensitive in the nearterm to changes in interest rates as we expect the assumed repricing of our assets and payfixed swaps to modestly outpace the assumed repricing of our liabilities within the 12month horizon we expect the balance sheet to revert to liability sensitive our interestrate risk position is influenced by the impact of hedging activity which primarily consists of interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of certain fixedrate assets and fixedrate debt instruments additionally we use interest rate floor contracts designated as cash flow hedges on certain floatingrate assets the size maturity and mix of our hedging activities are adjusted as our balance sheet alm objectives and the interest rate environment evolve over time our hedging strategies however are not designed to eliminate all interestrate risk and we were adversely affected from rising interest rates in and operating lease residual risk management we are exposed to residual risk on vehicles in the consumer operating lease portfolio this operating lease residual

a proprietary model which includes variables such as age expected mileage seasonality segment factors vehicle type economic indicators production cycle automotive manufacturer incentives and unanticipated shifts in used vehicle supply as well as expert judgment this internally generated data is compared against thirdparty independent data for reasonableness periodically we revise the projected value of the leased vehicle at termination based on current market conditions and adjust depreciation expense over the remaining life of the contract as necessary at termination our actual sales proceeds from remarketing the vehicle may be higher or lower than the estimated residual value resulting in a gain or loss on remarketing recorded through depreciation expense remarketing

internet and physical sale to dealer sale to lessee and other methods the results within these channels vary with physical auction typically resulting in the lowestpriced outcome manufacturer vehicle and marketing programs automotive manufacturers influence operating lease residual results in the following ways the brand image of automotive manufacturers and consumer demand for their products affects residual risk the discontinuation of or stylistic changes to a certain make or model may affect the value of existing vehicles automotive manufacturer marketing programs may influence the used vehicle market for those vehicles through programs such as incentives on new vehicles programs designed to encourage lessees to terminate their operating leases early in conjunction with the

cash commitments under both normal operating conditions as well as periods of economic or financial stress our primary objective is to maintain costeffective stable and diverse sources of funding capable of sustaining the organization throughout all market cycles sources of funding include both retail and brokered deposits and secured and unsecured marketbased funding across various maturity interest rate and investor profiles additional liquidity is available through a pool of unencumbered highly liquid securities repurchase agreements advances from the fhlb of pittsburgh and the frb discount window we define liquidity risk as the risk that an institutions financial condition or overall safety and soundness is adversely affected by the actual or perceived inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding or to easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significantly lowering market prices because of inadequate market depth or market disruptions liquidity risk can arise from a variety of institutionspecific or marketrelated events that could have a negative impact on cash flows available to the organization effective management of liquidity risk positions an organization to meet cash flow obligations caused by unanticipated events managing liquidity needs and contingent funding exposures has proven essential to the solvency of financial institutions the alco chaired by the corporate treasurer is responsible for overseeing our funding and liquidity strategies corporate treasury is responsible for managing our liquidity positions within limits approved by alco the ermc and the rc as part of managing liquidity risk corporate treasury prepares monthly forecasts depicting anticipated funding needs and sources of funds executes our funding strategies and manages liquidity under normal as well as more severely stressed macroeconomic environments oversight and monitoring of liquidity risk are provided by independent risk management the monthly liquidity forecasts demonstrate our ability to generate and obtain adequate amounts of cash to meet loan and operating lease demand debt maturities deposit withdrawals and other cash commitments under normal operating conditions throughout the forecast horizon currently through december refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the scheduled maturity of longterm debt as of december in recent years we have become less reliant on marketbased funding reducing our exposure to disruptions in wholesale funding markets funding strategy liquidity and ongoing profitability are largely dependent on the timely and costeffective access to retail deposits and funding in various segments of the capital markets we focus on maintaining diversified funding sources across a broad base of depositors lenders and investors to meet liquidity needs throughout different economic cycles including periods of financial distress these funding sources include retail and brokered deposits public and private assetbacked securitizations unsecured debt fhlb advances and repurchase agreements our access to diversified funding sources enhances funding flexibility and results in a more costeffective funding strategy over the long term we evaluate funding markets on an ongoing basis to achieve an appropriate balance of unsecured and secured funding sources and maturity profiles we manage our funding to achieve a wellbalanced portfolio across a spectrum of risk maturity and costoffunds characteristics optimizing funding at ally bank continues to be a key part of our longterm liquidity strategy we optimize our funding sources at ally bank by prioritizing retail deposits maintaining an active securitization program managing the maturity profile of our brokered deposit portfolio utilizing repurchase agreements and continuing to access funds from the fhlb assets are primarily originated by ally bank to reduce parent company exposures and funding requirements and to utilize our growing consumer deposittaking capabilities this allows us to use bank funding for substantially all our automotive finance and other assets and to provide a sustainable longterm funding channel for the business while also improving the cost of funds for the enterprise liquidity risk management multiple metrics are used to measure liquidity risk manage the liquidity position identify related trends and monitor these trends and metrics against established limits these metrics include comprehensive stress tests that measure the sufficiency of the liquidity portfolio over stressed horizons ranging from overnight to months stability ratios that measure longerterm structural liquidity and concentration ratios that enable prudent funding diversification in addition we have established internal management routines designed to review all aspects of liquidity and funding plans evaluate the adequacy of liquidity buffers review stress testing results and assist management in the execution of its funding strategy and riskmanagement accountabilities our liquidity stress testing is designed to allow us to operate our businesses and to meet our contractual and contingent obligations including unsecured debt maturities for at least months assuming our normal access to funding is disrupted by severe marketwide and enterprisespecific

of eligible longterm debt we would expect all three issuances to qualify under the requirement for covered bank holding companies refer to the section below titled response to banking industry failures for more information about the proposed rule we raised billion through the completion of term securitization transactions backed by consumer automotive loans we issued billion of brokered cds we increased our total available funding capacity through the frb discount window by billion during the year ended december to billion as of december the increase in frb discount window capacity reflects our strategy to maintain increased contingent liquidity following the bank failures of early and to further align with the addendum to the interagency policy statement on funding and liquidity risk management importance of contingency funding plans released in july we increased and diversified repurchase agreement transaction funding with our counterparties response to banking industry failures in march the fdic was appointed as receiver for svb and signature after they experienced runs on deposits and other liquidity constraints at the time svb and signature were the 16th and 29th largest banks in the united states respectively as measured by total assets as of december also during march ubs group ag announced the acquisition of credit suisse group ag with the support of the swiss government our liquidity position fundamentally differs from those of svb and signature before their failures for example approximately of total deposits at ally bank excluding affiliate and intercompany deposits were fdicinsured as of december compared to for svb and for signature as of december additionally our deposit portfolio is primarily composed of granular and diversified retail customer accounts as opposed to svb and signature who had large uninsured commercial deposits because of the market turbulence and uncertainty however we activated existing internal incident response procedures specifically designed to increase governance and monitoring of ally banks depositor behavior liquidity position and risk exposure including frequent ongoing dialogue with the board

monetary tightening in and the resultant macroeconomic uncertainty we had increased cash and available liquidity refer to the section above titled recent funding developments after the failures we continued to do so by optimizing brokered cd issuances borrowing from the fhlb managing securities collateral pledged to the fhlb maintaining competitive retail deposit pricing and managing new loan origination volumes we had billion of total available liquidity as of december which included billion of available fhlb capacity and billion of available frb discount window capacity refer to the section above titled liquidity risk management fhlb funding provides us with a stable funding source and can be drawn upon on a sameday basis if sufficiently secured with available collateral in support of american businesses and households the frb created the btfp in march to make additional funding available to eligible depository institutions in order to help assure that banks have the ability to meet the needs of all of their depositors the btfp is a further source of liquidity against highquality securities and contributes to financial stability by eliminating a banks need to quickly sell those securities in times of stress under the btfp depository institutions may borrow funds by pledging collateral eligible for purchase by the frb in open market operations such as us treasuries and agency debt and mortgagebacked securities in each case valued at par in january the frb announced that the btfp will cease making new loans as scheduled on march we did not borrow from the btfp through december as of december we had billion in total available funding capacity through the frb discount window with no debt outstanding during the year ended december following the failures of svb and signature on may first republic bank was closed by the california department of financial protection and innovation which appointed the fdic as receiver the fdic entered into a purchase and assumption agreement with jpmorgan chase bank to assume all the deposits and substantially all the assets of first republic bank we continue to monitor and assess the impact of these failures on category iv firms like ally in april in a statement accompanying the review of the frbs supervision and regulation of svb frb vice chair for supervision barr highlighted a plan to revisit the tailoring rules and develop stronger capital liquidity stresstesting and other standards for category iv firms like ally in july the us banking agencies issued a proposed rule to customize and implement revisions to the global basel iii capital framework that were approved by the basel committee in december commonly known as the basel iii endgame or as basel iv for regulatory capital the proposed rule would eliminate the effect of the tailoring rules by requiring the recognition of most elements of accumulated other comprehensive income and loss and the application of deductions limitations and criteria for specified capital investments minority interests and tlac holdings for each of the riskbased capital ratios a large banking organization like ally would calculate and be bound by the lower of two alternatives one version of the ratio based on an expanded riskbased approach prescribed in the proposed rule and one version of the ratio based on the standardized approach as modified by the proposed rule all capital buffer requirements including the stress capital buffer requirement would apply regardless of whether the expanded riskbased approach or the standardized approach produces the lower ratio under the expanded riskbased approach total rwas would equal the sum of the rwas for credit risk equity risk operational risk market risk and cva risk as set forth in the proposed rule minus any amount of the banking organizations adjusted allowance for credit losses that is not included in tier capital and any amount of allocated transfer risk reserves under the standardized approach total rwas would be calculated using the existing rules with a revised methodology for determining rwas for market risk and a required application of the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk for derivative exposures category iv firms would be further required under the proposed rule to project their riskbased capital ratios under baseline conditions in their capital plans and related reports using the rwacalculation approach that results in their binding riskbased capital ratios as of the start of the projection horizon the proposed rule also would roll back additional elements of the tailoring rules by applying to category iv firms the supplementary leverage ratio the countercyclical capital buffer and enhanced public disclosure and reporting requirements under the proposed rule a threeyear transition period from july to june would apply to the recognition of accumulated other comprehensive income and loss in regulatory capital and the use of the expanded riskbased approach the phasein of accumulated other comprehensive income and loss is expected to significantly affect our levels of regulatory capital while we believe that this would be manageable we also anticipate that our levels of regulatory capital would need to be gradually increased in advance of and during the proposed transition period as for the proposed changes to rwas while we continue to evaluate the effects of individual provisions and the interplay among them as well as potential management actions in response the impact is not currently expected to be significant in the aggregate if the proposed rule were adopted in its existing form since the proposed rule was issued we have been engaged with research and advocacy groups to inform the rulemaking process and better understand the impacts of the proposed rule on banking organizations of various sizes and complexitiesas well as the competitive environment more broadlyand likewise encourage the us banking agencies to closely study these impacts and their wider implications in august the us banking agencies issued a proposed rule to improve the resolvability of category iv firms like ally the proposed rule would require category ii iii and iv firms their large consolidated banks and other institutions to issue and maintain minimum amounts of eligible longterm debt in an amount that is the greater of i percent of total rwas ii percent of average total consolidated assets and iii percent of total leverage exposure covered insured depository institutions like ally bank that are consolidated subsidiaries of covered entities like ally would be required to issue eligible longterm debt internally to a company that consolidates the covered insured depository institution which would in turn be required to purchase that longterm debt only longterm debt instruments that are most readily able to absorb losses in a resolution proceeding would qualify and the operations of covered entities would be subject to cleanholdingcompany requirements such as prohibitions and limitations on their liabilities to unaffiliated entities under the proposed rule a transition period would apply with and percent of the longtermdebt requirements coming into effect by the end managements discussion and analysis ally financial inc form 10k of the first second and third years respectively after finalization of the rule we are still assessing the impact of this proposed rule but due to the current structure and amount of debt instruments issued by ally and ally bank we expect it to significantly affect us whether and when final rules related to these proposals may be adopted and take effect as well as what changes to the proposed rules may be reflected in any final rules after the comment periods remain unclear also beyond these proposed rules more stringent and less tailored liquidity stresstesting and other standards for category iv firms like ally may be forthcoming including those that may reinstate the lcr require more rigorous liquidity stress testing and return ally to supervisory stress testing on an annual cycle refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information in august citing macroeconomic trends impacting the banking industry such as increased costs of funding and rapid tightening in monetary policy moodys downgraded the credit ratings of a number of banks additionally moodys downgraded the outlook of a number of banks including ally where the outlook was lowered from stable to negative refer to the section below titled credit ratings for additional information on november the fdic finalized a rule that imposes a special assessment to recover the costs to the dif resulting from the fdics use in march of the systemic risk exception to the leastcost resolution test under the fdi act in connection with the receiverships of svb and signature the fdic estimated in approving the rule that those assessed losses total approximately billion the rule provides that this loss estimate will be periodically adjusted which will affect the amount of the special assessment under the rule the assessment base is the estimated uninsured deposits that an idi reported in its consolidated reports of condition and income call report at december excluding the first billion in estimated uninsured deposits the special assessments will be collected at an annual rate of approximately basis points per year basis points per quarter over eight quarters in and with the first assessment period beginning january because the estimated loss pursuant to the systemic risk determination will be periodically adjusted the fdic retains the ability to cease collection early extend the special assessment collection period and impose a final shortfall special assessment on a onetime basis ally expects the special assessments to be tax deductible the total of the assessments for ally based on ally banks

estimates accounting policies are integral to understanding our mda the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make certain judgments and assumptions on the basis of information available at the time of the financial statements in determining accounting estimates used in the preparation of these statements our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements certain of our critical accounting policies requiring significant management assumptions and judgment are described in this section an accounting estimate is considered critical if the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made if actual results differ from our judgments and assumptions then it may have an adverse impact on the results of operations and cash flows our management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with the ac and the ac has reviewed our disclosure relating to these estimates allowance for loan losses we maintain an allowance for loan losses the allowance to reflect the net amount expected to be collected from our lending portfolios the allowance is maintained at a level that management considers to be adequate based upon ongoing assessments and evaluations using relevant available information we maintain a governance and internal control framework to support the establishment of our allowance and models used in that allowance process are regularly assessed through ongoing performance monitoring routines that are reviewed by the model risk management function the allowance is measured using statistically estimated models that are designed to correlate customer and collateral quality as well as certain macroeconomic variables to expected future credit losses the macroeconomic data used in the models is based on forecasted variables for the next months beyond this forecast period we revert to a historical average for each of the variables on a straightline basis over months our baseline macroeconomic forecast is consistent with the 50th percentile in a distribution of possible economic outcomes the consumer portfolio segments consist of loans that generally share similar risk characteristics within our automotive finance operations mortgage finance operations and our personal lending and credit card operations both of which are included within corporate and other for additional information regarding the allowance calculation for the consumer portfolio segments refer to note to the consolidated financial statements managements discussion and analysis ally financial inc form 10k the commercial portfolio segment is composed of loans that may or may not share similar risk characteristics within our automotive finance operations and corporate finance operations for additional information regarding the allowance calculation for the commercial portfolio segment refer to note to the consolidated financial statements the determination of the allowance is influenced by numerous assumptions and factors that may materially affect estimates of loss the critical assumptions underlying the allowance include i segmentation of each portfolio based on common risk characteristics ii the development of reasonable and supportable forecasts of future macroeconomic conditions and iii evaluation by management of borrower collateral and geographic information management monitors the adequacy of the allowance and makes adjustments as the assumptions in the underlying analyses change to reflect an estimate of expected lifetime loan losses at the reporting date based on the best information available at that time the allowance reflects managements estimate of expected credit losses over the contractual term of our lending portfolio and involves significant judgment which could materially affect the provision for credit losses and therefore net income for additional information regarding our portfolio segments and classes allowance for loan losses and other credit quality indicators refer to note to the consolidated financial statements macroeconomic sensitivity analysis we perform a sensitivity analysis using scenarios derived from widely published macroeconomic forecasts to quantify the sensitivity of our baseline forecast to alternative changes in macroeconomic conditions these scenarios are based on fixed probabilities of occurrence the unfavorable or downside scenario is consistent with the 90th percentile in a distribution of possible economic outcomes and implies that there is a chance that the realized economy will be better than the defined path and a chance that the realized economy will be worse than the defined path the alternative unfavorable or alternative downside scenario is consistent with the 96th percentile in a distribution of possible economic outcomes and implies that there is a chance that the realized economy will be better than the defined path and a chance that the realized economy will be worse than the defined path as of december results of this sensitivity analysis indicate that the downside scenario would increase our allowance for loan losses by and the alternative unfavorable scenario would increase our allowance for loan losses by these results are estimates that are directly tied to the timing severity and duration of changes in the independently and instantaneously shocked macroeconomic scenario actual loss sensitivities and resulting estimates of consolidated allowance for loan losses may be influenced by numerous other factors including but not limited to the actual evaluation of macroeconomic conditions the underlying performance of our portfolios relative to historical loss experience future government and management actions and other quantitative and qualitative information and adjustments therefore this sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and is not intended to represent our expectation of changes in our estimate of expected credit losses due to a change in the macroeconomic environment valuation of automotive operating lease assets and residuals we have significant investments in vehicles in our operating lease portfolio in accounting for operating leases management must make a determination at the beginning of the operating lease contract of the estimated realizable value ie residual value of the vehicle at the end of the lease this evaluation is primarily based on a proprietary model which includes variables such as age of the vehicle expected mileage seasonality segment factors vehicle type economic indicators production cycle automotive manufacturer incentives and shifts in used vehicle supply this internally generated data is compared against thirdparty independent data for reasonableness the customer is obligated to make payments during the term of the lease for the difference between the purchase price and the contract residual value plus rental charges however since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract we are exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the value of the vehicle is below the residual value estimated at contract inception for additional information regarding residual value refer to note to the consolidated financial statements to account for residual risk we depreciate automotive operating lease assets to expected realizable value on a straightline basis over the lease term the estimated realizable value is initially based on the expected residual value established at contract inception periodically we review the projected value of the leased vehicle at termination based on current market conditions and other relevant data points and adjust depreciation expense as necessary over the remaining term of the lease management periodically performs a detailed review of the estimated realizable value of vehicles to assess the appropriateness of the carrying value of operating lease assets impairment of operating lease assets is assessed upon the occurrence of a triggering event triggering events are systemic observed events impacting the used vehicle market such as shocks to oil and gas prices that may indicate impairment of the operating lease asset for additional information regarding operating lease impairment refer to note to the consolidated financial statements our depreciation methodology for operating lease assets considers managements expectation of the value of the vehicles upon lease termination which is based on numerous assumptions and factors influencing used vehicle values the critical assumptions underlying the estimated carrying value of automotive operating lease assets include i estimated market value information obtained and used by management in estimating residual values ii proper identification and estimation of business conditions iii our remarketing abilities and iv automotive manufacturer vehicle and marketing programs changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the operating lease residual value managements discussion and analysis ally financial inc form 10k lessees have the first opportunity to purchase the offlease vehicle at the end of the lease term for the price stated in the lease agreement if the lessee declines to purchase the offlease vehicle the dealer is offered the opportunity to purchase the vehicle directly from us at a price we define if both the lessee and the dealer decline their options to purchase we remarket the offlease vehicle at auction at this point we are exposed to a risk of loss if the realized values of our leased vehicles were to decline below our estimated realizable values we would incur million of incremental depreciation expense over the remaining life of our operating lease portfolio on a scheduled termination basis additionally this is based on the improbable event that all vehicles were remarketed at auction due to lessees and dealers foregoing their purchase options fair value of financial instruments we use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain instruments and to determine fair value disclosures refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of valuation methodologies used to measure material assets and liabilities at fair value and details of the valuation models key inputs to those models and significant assumptions utilized we follow the fair value hierarchy set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements in order to prioritize the inputs utilized to measure fair value we review and modify as necessary our fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis which can result in reclassifications between hierarchy levels we have numerous internal controls in place to address risks inherent in estimating fair value measurements significant fair value measurements are subject to detailed analytics and management review and approval we have an established risk management policy and model validation program this model validation program establishes a controlled environment for the development implementation and operation of models used to generate fair value measurements and change procedures further this program uses a riskbased approach to determine the frequency at which models are to be independently reviewed and validated additionally a wide array of operational controls governs fair value measurements including controls over the inputs into and the outputs from the fair value measurement models for example we backtest the internal assumptions used within models against actual performance we also monitor the market for recent trades market surveys or other market information that may be used to benchmark model inputs or outputs certain valuations will also be benchmarked to market indices when appropriate and available we have scheduled model or input recalibrations that occur on a periodic basis but will recalibrate earlier if significant variances are observed as part of the backtesting or benchmarking noted above considerable judgment is used in forming conclusions from market observable data used to estimate our level fair value measurements and in estimating inputs to our internal valuation models used to estimate our level fair value measurements level inputs such as interest rate movements prepayment speeds credit losses and discount rates are inherently difficult to estimate changes to these inputs can have a significant effect on fair value measurements and amounts that could be realized refer to the section titled fair value

expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect managements best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes predominantly in the united states we file income tax returns in approximately jurisdictions federal state and local the laws and regulations of each jurisdiction are complex and may be subject to different interpretations significant judgments and estimates are required in determining consolidated income tax expense for each jurisdiction our interpretations of tax laws are subject to audits by various jurisdictions potential difference in the interpretation or changes in the tax laws may result in additional accrual of income tax expense or benefit which could be material to our reported results we consistently monitor new and reassess existing tax laws for changes and adjust our tax estimates accordingly our provision for income taxes is comprised of current and deferred income taxes deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent results of operations in projecting future taxable income we begin with historical results adjusted for changes in accounting policies and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state federal and foreign pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide we consider three years of cumulative operating income loss as of each reporting date we consider existing evidence both positive and negative that could impact our view with regard to future realization of deferred tax assets we currently hold deferred tax asset attributes related to net operating tax loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards we perform regular assessments to determine whether our tax attributes are realizable as of december we continue to believe it is more likely than not that the benefit for certain foreign tax credit carryforwards and state net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized in recognition of this risk we continue to provide a partial valuation allowance on these deferred tax assets relating to these carryforwards and it
