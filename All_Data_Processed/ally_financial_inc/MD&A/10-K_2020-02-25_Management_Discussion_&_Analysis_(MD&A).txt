compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor to the administrator of libor after due to the uncertainty surrounding the future of libor it is expected that a transition away from the use of libor to alternative benchmark rates will occur by the end of the discontinuation of libor or liborbased rates will present risks to our business as further described in the section titled risk factors in part i item of this report in recognition of these risks and uncertainties we have established an enterprisewide libor transition program to identify assess monitor and mitigate risks that may arise from the potential discontinuation of libor our program spans across impacted business lines and functions to evaluate risks associated with the transition while taking into account specific considerations related to our customers products and instruments and counterparty exposures through this program we continue to assess and plan for potential impacts to our existing and future

commercial automotive loans corporate finance loans and mortgage loans as well as certain investment securities and derivative contracts among other arrangements our commercial automotive loan portfolio is primarily composed of wholesale floorplan financing to automotive dealers currently a significant portion of our wholesale floorplan finance receivables are invoiced utilizing a liborbased reference rate and as such represents our largest exposure to libor based on notional dollar amount smaller loan portfolios that utilize contracts containing liborbased reference rates include our corporate finance heldforinvestment loans and lending commitments and our adjustablerate mortgage loans with respect to our liabilities we have issued trust preferred securities with an interest rate linked to libor and also have secured facilities certain assetbacked securitizations and brokered certificates of deposit that also contain liborbased reference rates with respect to selecting an alternative benchmark we continue to evaluate the most appropriate course of action for each instrument that currently references libor as well as any future instruments that reference a benchmark for example the alternative reference rates committee arrc a group convened by the frb has identified the secured overnight financing rate sofr as its preferred alternative rate for libor sofr is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by us treasury securities and is based on directly observable us treasurybacked purchase transactions we are evaluating sofr among other alternatives and actions as a potential alternative reference rate to libor and are taking steps to assess the operational financial and various other impacts this change could have to our business additionally we continue to evaluate inclusion of appropriate fallback provisions to our contracts to adequately address alternatives in the absence of libor including evaluating the fallback language proposed by the arrc for certain contracts we will continue to actively monitor industry developments and their potential impact to us we are also actively assessing how the discontinuation of libor could impact accounting and financial reporting including but not limited to potential impacts to our hedge accounting valuation or modeling or impacts associated with modifying the terms of our loan agreements or debt instruments with our customers or counterparties we also continue to monitor the activities of the standard setters such as the fasb which has issued proposed guidance and new accounting standard updates that provide certain relief related to the transition away from libor for example the fasb issued asu derivatives and hedging topic inclusion of the secured overnight financing rate sofr overnight index swap ois rate as a benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes which permits the use of the ois rate based on the sofr to be designated as a benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes in addition the fasb has recently issued proposed guidance that would help ease the potential effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting the proposed guidance would offer optional expedients and exceptions for applying gaap to modifications of certain contracts hedging relationships or other transactions that would be driven by reference rate reform we anticipate this guidance will be issued as a final asu in the first half of ally recognizes the significance of libor cessation and has devoted numerous resources throughout all levels

analysis interest rate risk represents our most significant exposure to market risk we actively monitor the level of exposure to movements in interest rates and take actions to mitigate adverse impacts these movements may have on future earnings we use a sensitivity analysis of net financing revenue as our primary metric to measure and manage the interest rate risk of our financial instruments we prepare forwardlooking baseline forecasts of net financing revenue taking into consideration anticipated future business growth assetliability positioning and interest rates based on the implied forward curve the analysis is highly dependent upon a variety of assumptions including the repricing characteristics of retail deposits with both contractual and noncontractual maturities we continually monitor industry and competitive repricing activity along with other market factors when contemplating deposit pricing actions simulations are then used to assess changes in net financing revenue in multiple interest rate scenarios relative to the baseline forecast the changes in net financing revenue relative to the baseline are defined as the sensitivity our simulations incorporate contractual cash flows and repricing characteristics for all assets liabilities and offbalancesheet exposures and incorporate the effects of changing interest rates on the prepayment and attrition rates of certain assets and liabilities our simulation does not assume any specific future actions are taken to mitigate the impacts of changing interest rates the net financing revenue sensitivity tests measure the potential change in our pretax net financing revenue over the following months a number of alternative rate scenarios are tested including immediate and gradual parallel shocks to the implied market forward curve management also evaluates nonparallel shocks to interest rates and stresses to certain term points on the yield curve in isolation to capture and monitor a number of risk types relative to our baseline forecast which is based on the implied forward curve our net financing revenue over the next months would increase by million if interest rates remain unchanged the following table presents the pretax dollar impact to forecasted net financing revenue over the next months assuming basis point and basis point instantaneous parallel and gradual

of this change is reflected in our baseline net financing revenue projections as of december our net interest income sensitivity in the and basis point instantaneous shock scenarios has primarily been impacted by a net decrease in payfixed interest rate swaps partially offset by funding sources shifting from shortterm marketbased funding to deposits managements discussion and analysis ally financial inc form 10k the exposure in the downward instantaneous interest rate shock scenario has decreased as of december primarily due to the lower payfixed interest rate swap notional referenced above as well as the addition of interest rate floor contracts partially offset by increased mortgage prepayment risk in a lower interest rate environment our risk position is influenced by the impact of hedging activity which primarily consists of interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of certain fixedrate assets and fixedrate debt instruments and payfixed interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges of certain floatingrate debt instruments during the year ended december we initiated a hedging program of interest rate floor contracts designated as cash flow hedges on

and billion for the years ended december and respectively activity was largely consistent yearoveryear as cash flows from our consumer and commercial lending activities remained relatively flat net cash used in investing activities was billion for the year ended december compared to billion for the same period in the decrease was primarily due to a billion net decrease in cash outflows from

understanding our managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make certain judgments and assumptions on the basis of information available at the time of the financial statements in determining accounting estimates used in the preparation of these statements our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements critical accounting estimates are described in this section an accounting estimate is considered critical if the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made if actual results differ from our judgments and assumptions then it may have an adverse impact on the results of operations and cash flows our management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to these estimates allowance for loan losses we maintain an allowance for loan losses the allowance to absorb probable loan credit losses inherent in the heldforinvestment portfolio the allowance is maintained at a level that management considers to be adequate based upon ongoing quarterly assessments and evaluations of collectability and historical loss experience in our lending portfolio the allowance is managements estimate of incurred losses in our lending portfolio and involves significant judgment management performs quarterly analyses of these portfolios to determine if impairment has occurred and to assess the adequacy of the allowance based on historical and current trends and other factors affecting credit losses additions to the allowance are charged to current period earnings through the provision for loan losses amounts determined to be uncollectible are charged directly against the allowance while amounts recovered on previously chargedoff accounts increase the allowance determining the appropriateness of the allowance requires management to exercise significant judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain including the timing frequency and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the provision for loan losses and therefore net income for additional information regarding our portfolio segments and classes refer to note to the consolidated financial statements while we attribute portions of the allowance across our lending portfolios the entire allowance is available to absorb probable loan losses inherent in our total lending portfolio the consumer portfolio segments consist of smallerbalance homogeneous loans within our automotive finance operations mortgage finance operations and consumer unsecured lending included within corporate and other excluding certain loans that are identified as individually impaired the allowance for each consumer portfolio segment automotive mortgage and other is evaluated collectively the allowance is based on aggregated portfolio segment evaluations that begin with estimates of incurred losses in each portfolio segment based on various statistical analyses for our automotive and mortgage portfolio segments and a vintage analysis for our other portfolio segment we leverage statistical models based on recent loss trends to develop a systematic incurred loss reserve these statistical loss forecasting models are utilized to estimate incurred losses and consider several credit quality indicators including but not limited to historical loss experience current economic conditions credit scores and expected loss factors by loan type management believes these factors are relevant to estimate incurred losses and are updated on a quarterly basis in order to incorporate information reflective of the current economic environment as changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact in order to develop our best estimate of probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio management reviews and analyzes the output from the models and may adjust the reserves to take into consideration environmental qualitative and other factors that may not be captured in the models these adjustments are documented and reviewed through our risk management processes management reviews updates and validates its systematic process and loss assumptions on a periodic basis this process involves an analysis of loss information such as a review of loss and credit trends a retrospective evaluation of actual loss information to loss forecasts and other analyses the commercial portfolio segment is primarily composed of largerbalance nonhomogeneous exposures within our automotive finance operations and corporate finance operations these loans are primarily evaluated individually and are riskrated based on borrower collateral and industryspecific information that management believes is relevant in determining the occurrence of a loss event and measuring impairment a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement based on current information and events management establishes specific allowances for commercial loans determined to be individually impaired based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate and the observable market price or the fair value of collateral whichever is determined to be the most appropriate estimated costs to sell the collateral on a discounted basis are included in the impairment measurement when appropriate in addition to the specific allowances for impaired loans loans that are not identified as individually impaired are grouped into pools based on similar risk characteristics and collectively evaluated these allowances are based on historical loss experience concentrations current economic conditions performance trends within specific geographic locations and other qualitative factors identified by management the commercial historical loss experience is updated quarterly to incorporate the most recent data reflective of the current economic environment the determination of the allowance is influenced by numerous assumptions and many factors that may materially affect estimates of loss including volatility of loss given default probability of default and rating migration the critical assumptions underlying the allowance include i segmentation of each portfolio based on common risk characteristics ii identification and estimation of portfolio indicators and other factors that management believes are key to estimating incurred credit losses and iii evaluation by management of borrower collateral and geographic information management monitors the adequacy of the allowance and makes adjustments as the assumptions in the managements discussion and analysis ally financial inc form 10k underlying analyses change to reflect an estimate of incurred loan losses at the reporting date based on the best information available at that time in addition the allowance related to the commercial portfolio segment could be influenced by situations in which automotive manufacturers may repurchase vehicles used as collateral to secure the loans in default situations to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our estimates additional provision for credit losses may be required that would reduce earnings valuation of automotive operating lease assets and residuals we have significant investments in vehicles in our operating lease portfolio in accounting for operating leases management must make a determination at the beginning of the operating lease contract of the estimated realizable value ie residual value of the vehicle at the end of the lease residual value represents an estimate of the market value of the vehicle at the end of the lease term at contract inception we determine pricing based on the projected residual value of the vehicle this evaluation is primarily based on a proprietary model which includes variables such as age expected mileage seasonality segment factors vehicle type economic indicators production cycle automotive manufacturer incentives and shifts in used vehicle supply this internally generated data is compared against thirdparty independent data for reasonableness the customer is obligated to make payments during the term of the lease for the difference between the purchase price and the contract residual value plus rental charges however since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract we are exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the value of the vehicle is below the residual value estimated at contract inception management periodically performs a detailed review of the estimated realizable value of vehicles to assess the appropriateness of the carrying value of operating lease assets to account for residual risk we depreciate automotive operating lease assets to expected realizable value on a straightline basis over the lease term the estimated realizable value is initially based on the residual value established at contract inception periodically we review the projected value of the leased vehicle at termination based on current market conditions and other relevant data points and adjust depreciation expense as necessary over the remaining term of the lease impairment of operating lease assets is assessed upon the occurrence of a triggering event triggering events are systemic observed events impacting the used vehicle market such as shocks to oil and gas prices that may indicate impairment of the operating lease asset impairment is determined to exist if the expected undiscounted cash flows generated from the operating lease assets are less than the carrying value of the operating lease assets if the operating lease assets are impaired they are written down to their fair value as estimated by discounted cash flows there were no such impairment charges in or our depreciation methodology for operating lease assets considers managements expectation of the value of the vehicles upon lease termination which is based on numerous assumptions and factors influencing used vehicle values the critical assumptions underlying the estimated carrying value of automotive operating lease assets include i estimated market value information obtained and used by management in estimating residual values ii proper identification and estimation of business conditions iii our remarketing abilities and iv automotive manufacturer vehicle and marketing programs changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the operating lease residual value expected residual values include estimates of payments from automotive manufacturers related to residual support and risksharing agreements if any to the extent an automotive manufacturer is not able to fully honor its obligation relative to these agreements our depreciation expense would be negatively impacted fair value of financial instruments we use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain instruments and to determine fair value disclosures refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of valuation methodologies used to measure material assets and liabilities at fair value and details of the valuation models key inputs to those models and significant assumptions utilized we follow the fair value hierarchy set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements in order to prioritize the inputs utilized to measure fair value we review and modify as necessary our fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis which can result in reclassifications between hierarchy levels we have numerous internal controls in place to address risks inherent in estimating fair value measurements significant fair value measurements are subject to detailed analytics and management review and approval we have an established risk management policy and model validation program this model validation program establishes a controlled environment for the development implementation and operation of models used to generate fair value measurements and change procedures further this program uses a riskbased approach to determine the frequency at which models are to be independently reviewed and validated additionally a wide array of operational controls governs fair value measurements including controls over the inputs into and the outputs from the fair value measurement models for example we backtest the internal assumptions used within models against actual performance we also monitor the market for recent trades market surveys or other market information that may be used to benchmark model inputs or outputs certain valuations will also be benchmarked to market indices when appropriate and available we have scheduled model or input recalibrations that occur on a periodic basis but will recalibrate earlier if significant variances are observed as part of the backtesting or benchmarking noted above considerable judgment is used in forming conclusions from market observable data used to estimate our level fair value measurements and in estimating inputs to our internal valuation models used to estimate our level fair value measurements level inputs such as interest rate movements prepayment speeds credit losses and discount rates are inherently difficult to estimate changes to these inputs can have a significant effect on fair value measurements and amounts that could be realized determination of provision for income taxes our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect managements best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes predominantly in the united states significant managements discussion and analysis ally financial inc form 10k judgments and estimates are required in determining consolidated income tax expense deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent results of operations in projecting future taxable income we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state federal and foreign pretax operating income these assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide we consider three years of cumulative operating income loss as of each reporting date we consider existing evidence both positive and negative that could impact our view with regard to future realization of deferred tax assets following the sale of our legacy international operations in and we continue to hold unexpired foreign tax credits subject to a partial valuation allowance we continue to believe it is more likely than not that the benefit for certain foreign tax credit carryforwards and state net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized in recognition of this risk we continue to provide a partial valuation allowance on these deferred tax assets relating to these carryforwards and it is reasonably possible that the valuation allowance may change in the next months for additional information regarding our provision for income taxes refer to note to the consolidated financial
