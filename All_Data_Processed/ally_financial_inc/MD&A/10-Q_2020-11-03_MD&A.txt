in household business economic and market conditions including in the united states where we conduct nearly all of our business although several leading measures such as labor conditions and the rate of growth as measured by gdp indicate that an economic rebound has begun to occur ahead of initial expectations covid19 has not yet been contained and could continue to affect significantly more households and businesses many governmental and nongovernmental authorities initially responded to covid19 by curtailing household and business activity as a containment measure while simultaneously deploying fiscal and monetarypolicy measures to partially mitigate the adverse effects on individual households and businesses although this response slowed the rate of spread of covid19 and supported economic stability the number of cases has risen meaningfully at times and the potential exists for further resurgences to occur especially during the upcoming coldandflu season in addition while monetary policy remains highly accommodative a number of stimulative fiscal programs and actions have expired or been exhausted without renewal national regional and local economies and markets could suffer further disruptions that are lasting while we have experienced improvements in our business during the three months ended september the covid19 pandemic has negatively impacted us and our customers counterparties employees and thirdparty service providers since its spread began to accelerate in march at this time we cannot yet be confident in the extent of this negative impact or the

medical treatments and potential vaccinesand the adverse effects on our business financial position results of operations and prospects could be significant for further information on these risks and uncertainties refer to the section titled risk factors in part ii item of this report during the pandemic we have consistently prioritized the health and wellbeing of our employees offered industryleading support and relief to our customers and strived to make a difference in the communities where we operate these actions reflect our relentless do it right philosophy creditrisk management our credit performance has been directly impacted by the pandemic prior to the pandemic the national unemployment rate was below for an extended period and was projected to sustain those levels into the foreseeable future additionally most widely available forecasts assumed that a moderate rate of growth would continue throughout the impact of the lockdowns stayinplace directives and other restrictive actions issued and enforced by state and local officials as a result of the pandemic contributed to a significant increase in the national unemployment rate which rose to a peak of in april before moderating at a fasterthanexpectedpace to as of september similarly the rate of economic growth as measured by gdp declined sharply on a quarteroverquarter seasonally adjusted annualized rate basis in the second quarter by and rebounded in the third quarter of as the economy grew by quarteroverquarter based on this measure in response to the impacts caused by the covid19 pandemic we have taken significant actions to support our customers with industryleading relief programs while prudently managing our credit risk exposure in our consumer automotive loan portfolio existing customers had the option to elect to defer their payments for up to days without late fees being incurred but with finance charges continuing to accrue this program was made available to all consumer automotive loan customers beginning march the length of the deferral offering was reduced incrementally until on june we eliminated the offering and migrated back to our standard extension process following the termination of the program we have continued to work with impacted customers in accordance with our established credit risk management policies and practices we have invested significant resources including introducing enhanced digital capabilities and new communication tools to support customers who continue to experience hardships after the initial deferrals expire additionally our scaled staffing model and resource capabilities have allowed managements discussion and analysis ally financial inc form 10q for a nimble response to augment staffing to support these

refer to the section titled credit quality indicators in note to the condensed consolidated financial statements and to the section titled risk management within this mda in addition to the support that we have provided to our customers governments have taken unprecedented steps to partially mitigate the adverse effects of their actions to contain the spread of covid19 for example in late march the cares act was enacted to inject more than trillion of financial assistance into the us economy one component of the cares act is the ppp which is a guaranteed unsecured loan program administered by the sba loans under the ppp are fully guaranteed and may be forgiven by the sba and can be obtained by small businesses and other entities to cover payroll costs and other expenses including mortgage payments rents and utilities at september we had loans with a carrying value of million outstanding to our commercial dealer customers under the ppp as these loans are guaranteed by the sba we are exposed to limited to no incremental credit risk and do not maintain an allowance for loan losses under cecl for this portfolio among its other provisions the cares act significantly expanded eligibility for and the amount of unemployment benefits created and funded the advance payment of a refundable tax credit for and appropriated billion to the treasury secretary to support us air carriers and other us businesses that have not otherwise received adequate economic relief as well as states and municipalities a number of stimulus programs under the cares act have expired including the provision of enhanced unemployment benefits it is unclear whether congress will renew these programs or create new ones and how our customers will be impacted the pandemic has significantly impacted our provision for credit losses during the second half of march the economy experienced a significant deterioration driven by the covid19 pandemic which impacted our allowance for loan losses during the three months ended march we recorded an additional million of provision expense for credit losses associated with the deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook from covid19 during the second quarter of we incurred total provision expense of million which included million attributable to the macroeconomic environment and other factors aside from changes in portfolio size and incremental net chargeoffs during the third quarter of we incurred total provision expense of million our provision expense for the quarter was composed of a replenishment of reserves due to incremental net chargeoffs of million an increase in reserves of million driven by an increase in portfolio size and a reduction in reserves of million attributable to the improving macroeconomic environment predominately the unemployment rate and other factors aside from changes in portfolio size and incremental net chargeoffs additionally provision expense for credit losses was favorably impacted by lower net chargeoffs in our consumer automotive portfolio as losses decreased million for the three months ended september compared to the prior period in the significant decrease in net chargeoffs in our consumer automotive portfolio for the three months ended september was attributable to strong payment performance and delinquency trends through the pandemic personal income and savings levels have increased as lenders including us have provided significant support in the form of loan modifications and fee waivers which is in addition to the fiscal and monetary stimulus actions detailed above similarly consumer discretionary spending levels have decreased significantly during the pandemic most notably in the first and second quarters of driven by reductions in spending on services as a result of stayinplace orders and decreased travel net chargeoffs in our consumer automotive portfolio also continue to benefit from strong used vehicle prices in the third quarter of used vehicle prices as well as our offlease gain per unit reached the highest level since january which reduced the realized loss impact in instances of default our provision expense for credit losses increased million to billion for the nine months ended september while the macroeconomic environment has rebounded and improved during the quarter the increase in provision expense yearoveryear reflects the significant deterioration observed since the inception of the pandemic the deterioration in the macroeconomic environment drove a significant increase in our allowance for loan losses during as compared to while we are encouraged by the positive signs in performance observed during the three months ended september the degree to which our actions and those of governments and others will directly or indirectly assist our customers and the economy generally is not yet clear liquidity management funding and capital markets our retail deposit business has remained a source of strength for us through the pandemic to support our retail deposit customers we waived fees for overdrafts excessive transactions and expedited shipping of checks and debit cards through july through september we refunded fees of approximately million on excess transactions and overdrafts for our brokerage customers we waived fees for brokerassisted trades paper statements and overnight outbound check processing through july in our retail deposits business we continue to monitor several key items in light of a highly uncertain macroeconomic outlook including elevated competitive pressures on the directbanking industry given the low rate environment overall health of the consumer and potential impacts of the pandemic uncertainty around further stimulus measures and how customers deploy elevated savings levels over time our deposits franchise recorded strong growth in retail deposits during both the three months and nine months ended september during the three months managements discussion and analysis ally financial inc form 10q ended september we grew retail deposits by approximately billion to billion representing growth yearoveryear despite declines in online savings account yields as well as significant outflows as customers remitted tax payments to governmental authorities which typically occurs earlier in the year for the nine months ended september we grew retail deposits over billion led by an approximate billion increase in the second quarter of our retail deposit customer retention rate remained steady through the third quarter at while we grew our mix of total deposit funding to with the remainder through secured unsecured and fhlb borrowings for additional discussions surrounding our liquidity positions and related risks refer to the section titled liquidity management funding and regulatory capital in this mda in addition to the significant injection of fiscal stimulus by the federal government the frb has taken decisive and sweeping actions since march these actions have included a reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate to zero to percent a program to purchase an indeterminate amount of treasury securities and agency mortgagebacked securities and numerous facilities to support the flow of credit to households and businesses such as the municipal liquidity facility the main street lending program the primary market corporate credit facility the secondary market corporate credit facility the term assetbacked securities loan facility the money market mutual fund liquidity

respectively for the three months ended september we recognized net unrealized gains on equity securities of million as compared to net unrealized losses on equity securities of million for the nine months ended september given the unpredictability of covid19 and its direct and indirect effects on market conditions it is possible that unusual volatility in the equity markets could continue to positively or negatively impact our results regulatory capital and stress testing we continue to carefully monitor our capital and liquidity positions on march in order to support the frbs effort to mitigate the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the us economy and the financial system we announced the voluntary suspension of our stockrepurchase program through its termination on june consistent with the frbs restrictions on commonstock repurchases by large firms such as ally described below we do not currently plan to implement a new stockrepurchase program or repurchase shares of our common

requirement at the same time the frb announced its determination that changes in financial markets or the macroeconomic outlook could have a material effect on the risk profiles and financial conditions of firms subject to the capitalplan rule and that as a result the firms including ally would be required to resubmit capital plans to the frb within days after receiving updated stress

further discussion about regulatory capital capital planning and stress testing at september ally and ally bank were wellcapitalized and met all applicable regulatory capital requirements including with common equity tier capital ratios of and respectively compared to the minimum requirement of we continue to anticipate that we will have sufficient capital levels to meet all of these requirements dealer financial services our lending and finance receivable balances have been impacted by the pandemic through the second quarter of as governments acted to temporarily close or restrict the operations of businesses including automotive managements discussion and analysis ally financial inc form 10q dealers and as many consumers and businesses changed their behavior in response to governmental mandates and advisories to sharply restrain commercial and social interactions we experienced significant reductions in our consumer automotive loan applications in addition we observed downward pressure on the automotive sales and other operating results of our dealer customers on their capacity to accept the return of leased vehicles and on usedvehicle auction activity and values many automotive manufacturers and their suppliers also had taken measures to slow or shut down production in response to the pandemic which negatively affected dealer inventory levels and sales and significantly reduced wholesale floorplan lending business to dealers as consumers and businesses adapted to changed conditions and many governmental authorities relaxed their restrictions later in the second quarter we began to observe a recovery in quality loan application volume and resulting booked originations in addition automotive manufacturers and suppliers restarted production albeit at reduced levels and in august we experienced our first monthovermonth increase in wholesale floorplan balances since the pandemic was declared for the three months ended september we decisioned million consumer automotive financing applications consistent with prior year levels and funded balances of approximately billion as compared to million in applications and billion in

million in the third quarter of which was down slightly from million during the same period in the prior year written insurance premiums from our property and casualty business declined during the three months and nine months ended september as a result of lower vehicle inventory levels due primarily to impacts of covid19 other consumer and commercial products within our corporate finance business we experienced higher draws on commercial customer lines of credit during the second half of march but this trend abated in april through the second and third quarters of we experienced significant paydowns on draws that had been taken at the outset of the pandemic our balance of unfunded commitments increased from billion at the end of the first quarter of to billion and billion at the end of the second and third quarters respectively in our mortgage finance business refinance volume and prepayment activity increased through the third quarter of driven by lower market interest rates in ally invest we observed a significant increase in selfdirected accounts to thousand through the third quarter of while we experienced a significant outflow of deposits to brokerage accounts after the pandemic had been declared ally invest was able to capture approximately onethird of these outflows net customer assets reached billion as of september and we experienced higher than usual daily trade volume throughout the pandemic in our personal lending business we originated million of personal loans during the three months ended september almost double the amount originated during

management section of this mda for further discussion on our provision for credit losses noninterest expense increased million and million for the three months and nine months ended september respectively as compared to the three months and nine months ended september the increases for the three months and nine months ended september were driven by higher compensation and benefits expense

continue to make investments in our technology platform to enhance the customer experience and expand our digital capabilities and portfolio of products the increase for the nine months ended

investing and insurance activities give rise to market risk or the potential change in the value of our assets including securities assets heldforsale loans and operating leases and liabilities including deposits and debt due to movements in market variables such as interest rates credit spreads foreignexchange rates equity prices and offlease vehicle prices the impact of changes in benchmark interest rates on our assets and liabilities interest rate risk represents an exposure to market risk we primarily use interest rate derivatives to manage our interest rate risk exposure the fair value of our creditsensitive assets is also exposed to credit spread risk credit spread is the amount of additional return over the benchmark interest rates that an investor would demand for taking exposure to the credit risk of an instrument generally an increase in credit spreads would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement we are also exposed to foreigncurrency risk arising from foreigncurrency denominated assets and liabilities primarily in canada we enter into hedges to mitigate foreign exchange risk we also have exposure to changes in the value of equity securities we have exposure to equity securities with readily determinable fair values primarily related to our insurance operations for such equity securities we use equity derivatives to manage our exposure to equity price fluctuations in addition we are exposed to changes in the value of other equity investments without readily determinable fair market values refer to note to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information we may experience changes in the valuation of these investments which may cause volatility in our earnings the composition of our balance sheet including shorterduration consumer automotive loans and variablerate commercial loans coupled with the continued funding shift toward retail deposits partially mitigates market risk additionally we maintain riskmanagement controls that measure and monitor market risk using a variety of analytical techniques including market value sensitivity analysis and value at risk models refer to note to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information libor transition libor is an important interest rate benchmark that is expected to be discontinued by the end of we recognize the significance of libor cessation and have devoted numerous resources throughout all levels of the organization since to actively identify assess monitor and mitigate risks associated with this

financial statements the final guidance issued by the fasb is intended to help facilitate the market transition from existing reference interest rates to alternative reference interest rates this guidance provides temporary optional guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform the amendments provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying gaap to transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met the amendments primarily include relief related to contract modifications hedging relationships and it also provides a onetime election for the sale or transfer of debt securities classified as heldtomaturity this guidance is effective immediately and the amendments may be applied prospectively through december we are currently in the process of evaluating the amendments and we anticipate the final guidance will allow for greater flexibility in the transition away from libor net financing revenue sensitivity analysis interest rate risk represents one of our most significant exposures to market risk we actively monitor the level of exposure to movements in interest rates and take actions to mitigate adverse impacts these movements may have on future earnings we use a sensitivity analysis of net financing revenue as our primary metric to measure and manage the interest rate risk of our financial instruments we prepare forwardlooking baseline forecasts of net financing revenue taking into consideration anticipated future business growth assetliability positioning and interest rates based on the implied forward curve the analysis is highly dependent upon a variety of assumptions including the repricing characteristics of retail deposits with both contractual and noncontractual maturities we continually monitor industry and competitive repricing activity along with other market factors when contemplating deposit pricing actions simulations are then used to assess changes in net financing revenue in multiple interest rate scenarios relative to the baseline forecast the changes in net financing revenue relative to the baseline are defined as the sensitivity our simulations incorporate contractual cash flows and repricing characteristics for all assets liabilities and offbalancesheet exposures and incorporate the effects of changing interest rates on the prepayment and attrition rates of certain assets and liabilities our simulation does not assume any specific future actions are taken to mitigate the impacts of changing interest rates the net financing revenue sensitivity tests measure the potential change in our pretax net financing revenue over the following months we test a number of alternative rate scenarios including immediate and gradual parallel shocks to the implied market forward curve management also evaluates nonparallel shocks to interest rates and stresses to certain term points on the yield curve in isolation to capture and monitor a number of risk types relative to our baseline forecast which is based on the implied forward curve our net financing revenue over the next months would increase by million if interest rates remain unchanged the following table presents the pretax dollar impact to forecasted net financing revenue over the next months assuming various shocks to the implied market forward curve as of september and december gradual a instantaneous change in interest rates in millions september basis points basis points basis points b december basis points basis points basis points a gradual changes in interest rates are recognized over months b with rates at or near historical lows across the curve a scenario with rates declining basis points is being utilized which management believes is more meaningful to understand exposure to lower rates in the current market rate environment rather than the down basis point scenario our models currently assume rates do not go below zero the implied forward rate curve was significantly lower across all tenors compared to december as interest rates were at or near historical lows across the curve the impact of this change is reflected in our baseline net financing revenue projections as of september the expected benefit of an upward instantaneous interest rate shock scenario has increased primarily due to changes to our derivative hedging position higher cash balances as well as our continued shift in funding to retail deposits the exposure in the downward instantaneous interest rate shock scenario is largely driven by mortgage prepayment risk and is muted as our models assume rates do not go below zero managements discussion and analysis ally financial inc form 10q our risk position is influenced by the impact of hedging activity which primarily consists of interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of certain fixedrate assets and fixedrate debt instruments and payfixed interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges of certain floatingrate debt instruments we also have the ability to utilize interest rate floor contracts designated as cash flow hedges on certain floatingrate assets the size maturity and mix of our hedging activities are adjusted as our balance sheet alm objectives and interest rate environment evolve over time operating lease residual risk management we are exposed to residual risk on vehicles in the consumer operating lease portfolio this operating lease residual risk represents the possibility that the actual proceeds realized upon the sale of returned vehicles will be lower than the projection of these values used in establishing the pricing at lease inception however certain automotive manufacturers have provided their guarantee for portions of our residual exposure as further described in note to the condensed consolidated financial statements our operating lease portfolio net of accumulated depreciation was billion and billion as of september and december respectively the

periods in the increases in remarketing performance were primarily due to continued new vehicle supply constraints and an increase in demand for used vehicles the number of offlease vehicles remarketed during the three months and nine months ended september decreased and respectively compared to the same periods in primarily due to reduced early termination activity resulting from continued new vehicle supply constraints to support our customers and help mitigate lease residual risk we deferred lease payments without fees for up to days for any consumer requesting assistance related to the covid19 pandemic approximately of our lease customers enrolled in this lease modification program and approximately of these customers were granted a 120day deferral at the time of enrollment as of september substantially all of these customers had exited the program and of these approximately had paid in full and terminated their leases of the customers that had exited the program with outstanding lease obligations were current on their lease obligations as of september we also provided a program for and in some cases incentivized customers nearing their scheduled leaseend dates to extend their leases for up to an additional days eligible customers who opted into this program during the early part of the second quarter were not charged for the first month of

loan and operating lease demand debt maturities deposit withdrawals and other cash commitments under both normal operating conditions as well as periods of economic or financial stress our primary objective is to maintain costeffective stable and diverse sources of funding capable of sustaining the organization throughout all market cycles sources of funding include both retail and brokered deposits and secured and unsecured marketbased funding across various maturity interest rate and investor profiles additional liquidity is available through a pool of unencumbered highly liquid securities committed secured credit facilities repurchase agreements and advances from the fhlb of pittsburgh we define liquidity risk as the risk that an institutions financial condition or overall safety and soundness is adversely affected by the actual or perceived inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding or to easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significantly lowering market prices because of inadequate market depth or market disruptions liquidity risk can arise from a variety of institutionspecific or marketrelated events that could have a negative impact on cash flows available to the organization effective management of liquidity risk positions an organization to meet cash flow obligations caused by unanticipated events managing liquidity needs and contingent funding exposures has proven essential to the solvency of financial institutions the alco chaired by the corporate treasurer is responsible for overseeing our funding and liquidity strategies corporate treasury is responsible for managing our liquidity positions within limits approved by alco and the rc as part of managing liquidity risk corporate treasury prepares periodic forecasts depicting anticipated funding needs and sources of funds executes our funding strategies and manages liquidity under normal as well as more severely stressed macroeconomic environments oversight and monitoring of liquidity risk are provided by independent risk management funding strategy liquidity and ongoing profitability are largely dependent on the timely and costeffective access to retail deposits and funding in various segments of the capital markets we focus on maintaining diversified funding sources across a broad base of depositors lenders and investors to meet liquidity needs throughout different economic cycles including periods of financial distress these funding sources include retail and brokered deposits committed secured credit facilities public and private assetbacked securitizations unsecured debt fhlb advances wholeloan sales demand notes and repurchase agreements our access to diversified funding sources enhances funding flexibility and results in a more costeffective funding strategy over the long term we evaluate funding markets on an ongoing basis to achieve an appropriate balance of unsecured and secured funding sources and maturity profiles we manage our funding to achieve a wellbalanced portfolio across a spectrum of risk maturity and costoffunds characteristics optimizing funding at ally bank continues to be a key part of our longterm liquidity strategy we optimize our funding sources at ally bank by growing retail deposits maintaining active public and private securitization programs managing a prudent maturity profile of our brokered deposit portfolio utilizing repurchase agreements and continuing to access funds from the fhlb essentially all asset originations are directed to ally bank to reduce parent company exposures and funding requirements and to utilize our growing consumer deposittaking capabilities this allows us to use bank funding for an increasing proportion of our automotive finance and other assets and to provide a sustainable longterm funding channel for the business while also improving the cost of funds for the enterprise liquidity risk management multiple metrics are used to measure liquidity risk manage the liquidity position identify related trends and monitor such trends and metrics against established limits these metrics include comprehensive stress tests that measure the sufficiency of the liquidity portfolio over stressed horizons ranging from overnight to months stability ratios that measure longerterm structural liquidity and concentration ratios that enable prudent funding diversification in addition we have established internal management routines designed to review all aspects of liquidity and funding plans evaluate the adequacy of liquidity buffers review stress testing results and assist management in the execution of its funding strategy and riskmanagement accountabilities our liquidity stress testing is designed to allow us to operate our businesses and to meet our contractual and contingent obligations including unsecured debt maturities for at least months assuming our normal access to funding is disrupted by severe marketwide and enterprisespecific events we maintain available liquidity in the form of cash unencumbered highly liquid securities and available committed secured credit facility capacity this available liquidity is held at various

developments during march the spread of covid19 was declared a pandemic this global health crisis has resulted in economic disruption and volatility in the capital markets while credit spreads for longerterm funding sources such as unsecured debt and abs issuance increased significantly initially frb actions in response to the disruptions reduced credit spreads and improved market liquidity these actions included providing significant quantitativeeasing programs expanding the money market mutual fund liquidity facility to include a wider range of securities broadening the commercial paper funding facility launching new funds and facilities to support employers consumers and businesses and establishing the term assetbacked loan facility to facilitate abs issuance of student automotive credit card and small business loans guaranteed by the small business administration we continue to closely monitor market conditions and actions taken by banking agencies to support general market liquidity in recent years we have become less reliant on marketbased funding and believe we have adequate liquidity to meet our nearterm funding needs however it is not currently clear to what degree the covid19 pandemic will impact our future funding profile if market dislocation recurs key funding highlights from january to date were as follows for the nine months ended september we accessed the unsecured debt capital markets and raised billion through the issuance of senior notes which provided additional liquidity at ally financial inc we elected during the third quarter of to prepay and early terminate fhlb advances with an aggregate principal balance of billion to more costeffectively manage liquidity at ally bank our total capacity in committed secured credit

inc form 10q well as ally lending with a stable and lowcost funding source retail deposits are a key driver of funding cost optimization and reduced reliance on capital marketsbased funding we believe retail deposits are less sensitive to interest rate changes market volatility or changes in credit ratings when compared to other funding sources we have continued to expand our deposit gathering efforts through both direct and indirect marketing channels current retail deposit offerings consist of a variety of products including cds savings accounts moneymarket accounts ira deposit products as well as an interest checking product in addition we utilize brokered deposits which are obtained through thirdparty intermediaries including a deposit related to ally invest customer cash balances

during the first nine months of our total deposit base grew billion driven by continued growth in retail deposits which was partially offset by a reduction in brokered deposits total retail deposits increased billion primarily within our online savings product as we added approximately retail deposit customers during the nine months ended september and ended with more than million total retail deposit customers at september strong retention rates and customer acquisition reflecting the strength of the brand continue to drive growth in retail deposits during the third quarter of our retail deposit franchise continued to see robust quarterly growth as we recorded the third largest quarterly balance growth and fourth largest quarterly customer growth in our history balance growth was driven by customers persistent desire to build and maintain liquidity amidst economic uncertainty as well as by broad economic stimulus measures and muted spending this growth was partially offset by seasonal taxrelated outflows during the quarter we continue to enhance our suite of online and mobile banking features as we introduced a collection of smart savings tools to our online savings product in february in june kiplinger named ally bank the best internet bank for the fourth consecutive year and in october money magazine named ally the best online bank for the third consecutive year for additional information on our deposit funding by type refer to note to the condensed consolidated financial statements securitizations and secured financings while we primarily fund our business through deposits we also utilize securitizations and secured funding to further diversify our funding sources securitizations and secured funding transactions collectively referred to as securitization transactions allow us to convert our automotive finance receivables and operating leases into cash earlier than what would have occurred in the normal course of business we continue to remain active in the wellestablished securitization markets additionally for consumer automotive loans and operating leases the term structure of the transaction locks in funding for a specified pool of loans and operating leases which creates an effective tool for managing interest rate and liquidity risk for additional details surrounding our securitization activities refer to the section titled liquidity management funding and regulatory capital in our annual report on form 10k during the first nine months of we raised million through the completion of a term securitization transaction backed by consumer automotive loans we manage securitization execution risk by maintaining a diverse domestic and foreign investor base and available capacity from committed secured credit facilities provided by banks our ability to access the unused capacity in these facilities depends on the availability of eligible assets to collateralize the incremental funding and in some instances on the execution of interest rate hedges we maintain bilateral facilities which fund our automotive finance operations the facilities can be revolving in naturegenerally having an original tenor ranging from days to two years and allowing for additional funding during the commitment periodor they can be amortizing and not allow for any further funding after the commitment period at september all of our billion of capacity was revolving and of this balance million was from facilities with a remaining tenor greater than days our securitizations of commercial automotive loans are issued through a single master trust and include creditenhancement triggers as well as earlyrepayment triggers referred to as early amortization events following an early amortization event principal collections on the loans in the applicable securitizations are applied to repay principal of the trusts assetbacked securities rather than to purchase newly originated loans one of the early amortization events is based on the rates of inventory turnover at our dealer customers referred to as payment rates because the covid19 pandemic is placing downward pressure on the automotive sales of dealers and therefore their rate of inventory turnover an increased risk exists that an early amortization event could occur in such a case our ability to issue new securitizations out of this trust would be constrained or eliminated and our ability to fund commercial automotive loans through the securitization market managements discussion and analysis ally financial inc form 10q could be delayed while we establish a new trust in addition the mere occurrence of an early amortization event could impair our ability to access the securitization market or increase our cost to do so at this time none of these securitizations have experienced an early amortization event the majority of our securitizations including our secured bilateral financing facilities involve consumer automotive loans we retain exposure to the nonperformance of these loans through subordinated retained interests in the securitizations as well as obligations to repurchase loans affected by breaches of representations warranties or covenants the secured bilateral financing facilities also include creditenhancement triggers and revolving period termination events based on the nonperformance of loans with the covid19 pandemic adversely affecting some of our consumer automotive customers and with a significant number of them having enrolled in our loandeferral program these securitizations may become more likely to experience a deterioration in loan performance and downgrades by rating agencies in addition the secured bilateral financing facilities may become more likely to experience the activation of creditenhancement triggers and revolving period termination events any of these outcomes could have negative impacts on noteholders and us including in our case a potential for higher pricing and less market access for future securitizations we also have access to funding through advances with the fhlb these advances are primarily secured by consumer mortgage finance receivables and loans and investment securities as of september we had pledged billion of assets to the fhlb resulting in billion in total funding capacity with billion of debt outstanding at september billion of our total

retail automotive sales which reduced dealer stock levels net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended september was billion compared to net cash used in financing activities of billion for the same period in the change was primarily attributable a decrease of billion in net cash outflows related to repayments of longterm debt and a decrease of billion in net cash outflows

that as a result of judgments uncertainties uniqueness and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved could result in material changes to our financial condition results of operations or cash flows under different conditions or using different assumptions our most critical accounting estimates are as follows allowance for loan losses valuation of automotive lease assets and residuals fair value of financial instruments determination of provision for income taxes on january we adopted asu financial instruments credit losses this guidance replaced the incurred loss methodology which was used to calculate the allowance for loan losses as described in the consolidated financial statements in our annual report on form 10k with an expected lifetime loss methodology as described in the allowance for loan losses section below during we did not substantively change any material aspect of our overall methodologies and processes used in developing the remaining critical accounting estimates from what was described in the consolidated financial statements in our annual report on form 10k refer to note to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding the methodology used in calculating the provision for income taxes for interim financial reporting managements discussion and analysis ally financial inc form 10q allowance for loan losses we maintain an allowance for loan losses the allowance to reflect the net amount expected to be collected from our lending portfolios the allowance is maintained at a level that management considers to be adequate based upon ongoing quarterly assessments and evaluations using relevant available information which includes both internal and external sources relating to past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions additions and reductions to the allowance are charged to current period earnings through the provision for credit losses amounts determined to be uncollectible are charged directly against the allowance net of amounts recovered on previously chargedoff accounts expected recoveries do not exceed the total of amounts chargedoff or expected to be chargedoff the allowance is measured using statistical models that are designed to correlate certain macroeconomic variables to expected future credit losses the macroeconomic data used in the models is based on forecasted variables for the next months beyond this forecast period we revert to a historical average for each of the variables on a straightline basis over months the allowance reflects managements estimate of expected credit losses over the contractual term of our lending portfolio and involves significant judgment which could materially affect the provision for credit losses and therefore net income for additional information regarding our portfolio segments and classes refer to note to the condensed consolidated financial statements the consumer portfolio segments consist of smallerbalance homogeneous loans within our automotive finance operations mortgage finance operations and consumer unsecured lending operations which is included within corporate and other the allowance model for each consumer portfolio segment is calculated using proprietary statistical models and other risk indicators applied to pools of loans that share similar risk characteristics loans that do not share similar risk characteristics are evaluated individually for additional information regarding the allowance calculation for the consumer portfolio segments refer to note to the condensed consolidated financial statements the commercial portfolio segment is primarily composed of largerbalance nonhomogeneous exposures within our automotive finance operations and corporate finance operations these loans generally do not have similar risk characteristics and as a result are primarily evaluated individually management establishes specific allowances for commercial loans based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate or the observable market price or the fair value of collateral whichever is determined to be the most appropriate estimated costs to sell the collateral on an undiscounted basis are included in the impairment measurement when appropriate loans that share similar risk characteristics are pooled and evaluated collectively for additional information regarding the allowance calculation for the commercial portfolio segment refer to note to the condensed consolidated financial statements the determination of the allowance is influenced by numerous assumptions and many factors that may materially affect estimates of loss including changes in lgd pd and rating migration the critical assumptions underlying the allowance include i segmentation of each portfolio based on common risk characteristics ii the development of reasonable and supportable forecasts of future macroeconomic conditions and iii evaluation by management of borrower collateral and geographic information management monitors the adequacy of the allowance and makes adjustments as the assumptions in the underlying analyses change to reflect an estimate of expected lifetime loan losses at the reporting date based on the best information available at that time managements discussion and analysis ally financial inc form 10q statistical table the accompanying supplemental information should be read in
