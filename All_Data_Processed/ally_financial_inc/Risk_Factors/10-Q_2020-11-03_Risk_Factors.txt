changes to the risk factors described in our annual report on form 10k and our form 10q for the quarter ended june the covid19 pandemic is adversely affecting us and our customers counterparties employees and thirdparty service providers and the adverse impacts on our business financial position results of operations and prospects could be significant the spread of covid19 has created a global publichealth crisis that has resulted in widespread volatility and deteriorations in household business economic and market conditions including in the united states where we conduct nearly all of our business the extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our capital liquidity and other financial positions and on our business results of operations and prospects will depend on a number of evolving factors including the duration extent and severity of the pandemic covid19 has not yet been contained and could continue to affect significantly more households and businesses the duration and severity of the pandemic remain impossible to predict the response of governmental and nongovernmental authorities and the effect on economies and markets many governmental and nongovernmental authorities initially responded to covid19 by curtailing household and business activity as a containment measure while simultaneously deploying fiscal and monetarypolicy measures to partially mitigate the adverse effects on individual households and businesses although this response slowed the rate of spread of covid19 and supported economic stability the number of cases has risen meaningfully at times and the potential exists for further resurgences to occur especially during the upcoming coldandflu season in addition while monetary policy remains highly accommodative a number of stimulative fiscal programs and actions have expired or been exhausted without renewal national regional and local economies and markets could suffer further disruptions that are lasting the effect on our customers counterparties employees and thirdparty service providers covid19 and its associated consequences and uncertainties are affecting individuals households and businesses differently and unevenly many however have changed their behavior in response to governmental mandates and advisories to restrict or alter commercial and social interactions as a result our credit operational and other risks have generally been elevated and are expected to remain soif not increase furtherfor the foreseeable future during the nine months ended september the most notable impact to our results of operations was higher provision expense for credit losses our provision expense was billion for the nine months ended september compared to million during the same period in with the increase primarily driven by incremental reserves associated with a deterioration in macroeconomic variables such as unemployment during the nine months ended september for more detail and further discussion refer to the section titled covid19 impacts within the mda given the unpredictability of covid19 and its direct and indirect effects however our forecast of macroeconomic conditions and operating resultsincluding expected lifetime credit losses on our loan portfoliois subject to meaningful uncertainty through the second quarter of as governments acted to temporarily close or restrict the operations of businesses including automotive dealers and as many consumers and businesses changed their behavior in response we experienced significant reductions in our consumer automotive loan applications in addition we observed downward pressure on the automotive sales and other operating results of our dealer customers on their capacity to accept the return of leased vehicles and on usedvehicle auction activity and values many automotive manufacturers and their suppliers also had taken measures to slow or shut down production in response to the pandemic which negatively affected dealer inventory levels and sales and significantly reduced wholesale floorplan lending business to dealers as consumers and businesses adapted to changed conditions and many governmental authorities relaxed their restrictions later in the second quarter we began to observe a recovery in quality loan application volume and resulting booked originations in addition automotive manufacturers and suppliers restarted production albeit at reduced levels and we experienced our first monthovermonth increase in wholesale floorplan balances in august since the pandemic began for more detail and further discussion including in connection with our nonautomotive businesses refer to the section titled significant business developments related to covid19 within the mda we cannot yet be confident in the sustainability of these improvements in our business or the trajectory of the macroeconomic outlookespecially with the recent resurgence of covid19 in much of the united states and ongoing uncertainties around the efficacy availability and acceptance of medical ally financial inc form 10q treatments and potential vaccinesand the adverse effects on our business financial position results of operations and prospects could be significant as time goes on governments have taken unprecedented steps to partially mitigate the adverse effects of their actions to contain the spread of covid19 for example in late march the cares act was enacted to inject more than trillion of financial assistance into the us economy the frb has taken decisive and sweeping actions as well since march these actions have included a reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate to zero to percent a program to purchase an indeterminate amount of treasury securities and agency mortgagebacked securities and numerous facilities to support the flow of credit to households and businesses still while monetary policy has remained highly accommodative since the declaration of the pandemic fiscal stimulus has waned as a meaningful economic rebound developed over the summer and the political environment became more unstable with the approach of the elections it is not yet clear whether the political environment will become more salutary after the elections or whether further stimulative fiscalpolicy measures will be implemented we also acted swiftly to support our customers with industryleading relief programs while prudently managing our credit risk exposure for example in our consumer automotive loan portfolio existing customers had the option to elect to defer their payments for up to days without late fees being incurred but with finance charges continuing to accrue this program was made available to all consumer automotive loan customers beginning march the length of the deferral offering was reduced incrementally until on june we eliminated the offering and migrated back to our standard extension process approximately million consumer automotive loan customers enrolled in the program of which had reached their scheduled expiration as of september for our commercial dealer customers that were current on all payment obligations we offered a waiver of curtailments on wholesale floorplan loans an increase in floorplan advance rates a deferral of interest and insurance charges on wholesale borrowings and a deferral of term loan payments from april through july approximately or of eligible dealers requested at least one form of this assistance for at least one month as part of this program approximately of eligible wholesale dealers deferred wholesale interest and insurance payments during the third quarter of which represented a decline from the first and second quarters dealers that elected to defer wholesale interest and insurance payments have the option to repay such balances over a or 12month period without additional interest charges or fees for more detail and further discussion refer to the section titled credit quality indicators in note to the condensed consolidated financial statements and to the section titled risk managemen t within the mda the degree to which our actions and those of governments and others will directly or indirectly assist our customers counterparties and thirdparty service providers and advance our business and the economy generally is not yet clear for example while our loandeferral programs may better position customers to resume their regular payments to us in the future and enhance our brand and customer loyalty these programs may negatively impact our performance and not be as successful as we expect in managing our credit risk in addition while the frbs accommodative monetary policy may benefit us to some degree by supporting economic activity among our customers this policy and sudden shifts in it may inhibit our ability to grow or sustain net interest income and effectively manage interestrate and market risks further while extraordinary governmental intervention in the economy and markets has created stability the scale of these actions inevitably heightens political reputational litigation and similar risks for financial intermediaries like us also while governmental stimulus and relief programs may have supported the financial condition of some of our customers many of these programs and actions have expired or been exhausted and may not be renewed or replaced we are unable to estimate the nearterm and ultimate impacts of covid19 on our business and operations at this time the pandemic and its direct and indirect effects could cause us to experience higher credit losses in our lending portfolio additional increases in our allowance for credit losses impairment of our goodwill and other financial assets heightened volatility in and diminished access to capital markets and other funding sources further reduced demand for our products and services and other negative impacts on our financial position results of operations and prospects in addition while we continue to anticipate that our capital and liquidity positions will be sufficient sustained adverse effects may impair these positions prevent us from satisfying our minimum regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory requirements and result in downgrades in our credit ratings the covid19 pandemic and related governmental mandates and advisories also have necessitated changes in the way we and our thirdparty service providers continue operations and we may face heightened security informationtechnology operational and similar risks as a result the length of time we and our thirdparty service providers may be required to operate under these circumstances as well as the potential for conditions to worsen or for significant disruptions to occur remains unpredictable all of these risks and uncertainties can be expected to persist at least until the pandemic is demonstrably and sustainably contained authorities cease curbing household and business activity and consumer and business confidence recover ally financial inc form 10q
