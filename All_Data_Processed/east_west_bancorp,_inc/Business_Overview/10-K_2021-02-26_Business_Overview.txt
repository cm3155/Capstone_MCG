intended to ensure that banking organizations maintain capital that is commensurate with the degree of risk associated with their operations in july the federal banking agencies adopted final rules the basel iii capital rules establishing a comprehensive capital framework for us banking organizations that became effective for the company and the bank beginning january the basel iii capital rules define the components of regulatory capital include a required ratio of common equity tier cet1 capital to riskweighted assets and restrict the type of instruments that may be recognized in tier and capital including by phasing out trust preferred securities from tier capital for bank holding companies the basel iii capital rules also prescribe a standardized approach for risk weighting assets and include a number of risk weighting categories that affect the denominator in banking institutions regulatory capital ratios under the basel iii capital rules to be considered adequately capitalized standardized approach banking organizations such as the company and the bank are required to maintain minimum capital ratios of at least cet1 capital to riskweighted assets tier capital to riskweighted assets total capital tier plus tier to riskweighted assets and a tier leverage ratio of tier capital to average total consolidated assets the basel iii capital rules also include a capital conservation buffer of that fully phased in on january on top of each of the minimum riskbased capital ratios banking institutions with a riskbased capital ratio that meets or exceeds the

developments from time to time the regulatory agencies propose changes and amendments to and issue interpretations of riskbased capital requirements and related reporting instructions such proposals and interpretations could if implemented in the future affect our regulatory capital requirements and reported capital ratios in july the federal banking agencies issued a final rule the capital simplifications rule to reduce regulatory compliance burden by simplifying certain riskbased and leverage capital requirements of the basel iii capital rules for nonadvanced approaches banking organizations ie banking organizations with less than billion in total consolidated assets and with less than billion of onbalance sheet foreign exposures including the company and the bank the capital simplifications rule became effective for the company and the bank on april application of the capital simplifications rule to our consolidated balance sheet did not have a significant impact on the capital ratios of the company and the bank in light of the recent disruptions in economic conditions caused by covid19 pandemic the federal banking agencies have also revised the definition of eligible retained income to be the greater of a banking organizations net income for the four preceding calendar quarters net of any distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income and the average of a banking organizations net income over the preceding four quarters this revision reduces the likelihood that a banking organization is suddenly subject to abrupt and restrictive distribution limitations in a scenario where its capital ratios fall below an applicable minimum riskbased capital ratio requirement plus capital conservation buffer and instead makes the application of these limitations more gradual the revision became effective on march in april in recognition of the cares act requirements and to facilitate the use of the paycheck protection program liquidity facility ppplf the us banking agencies issued an interim final rule that allows banking organizations to exclude from riskbased and leverage capital requirements any eligible assets sold or pledged to the federal reserve on a nonrecourse basis through the ppplf the interim final rule states that ppp loans originated by a banking organization under the ppp will be riskweighted at zero percent for regulatory capital purposes and ppp loans pledged as collateral to ppplf may be excluded from the denominator of the tier leverage ratio in addition the cares act the banking agencies

benefit provided during the initial twoyear delay ie a fiveyear transition in total the company adopted the fiveyear transition in as a result the effects of cecl on the companys and the banks regulatory capital will be delayed through the year after which the effects will be phasedin over a threeyear period from january through december prompt corrective action the fdia as amended requires federal banking agencies to take pca with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements the fdia includes the following five capital tiers well capitalized

determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters a banks capital category is determined solely for the purpose of applying pca regulations and the capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of the banks overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes the fdia generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distributions including payment of any dividend or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized undercapitalized institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans if a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized requirements to reduce total assets cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks andor restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator the fdia also generally permits only well capitalized insured depository institutions to accept brokered deposits however an adequately capitalized institution may apply to the fdic for a waiver of this restriction economic growth regulatory relief and consumer act and stress testing in may the enactment of the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act egrrcpa amended certain provisions in the doddfrank act and other statutes administered by the

size threshold and provided relief for banks with assets between billion and billion with respect to many of the doddfrank acts enhanced prudential standards except for the risk committee requirements the egrrcpa also raised the asset size threshold for required companyrun stress testing at banks and bank holding companies from billion to billion additionally based on authority provided in the egrrcpa the federal reserve raised the asset size threshold for required supervisory stress testing at bank holding companies from billion to billion although the company and the bank are not required to conduct stress tests we continue to conduct annual capital and quarterly liquidity stress tests consumer financial protection bureau supervision the doddfrank act established the cfpb which has the authority to implement examine and enforce compliance with federal consumer financial laws that apply to banking institutions and certain other companies the cfpb has exclusive authority to examine insured depository institutions with assets exceeding billion such as the bank and their affiliates with respect to these consumer financial laws and may also take enforcement action the cfpb may focus its supervisory examination and enforcement efforts on among other things risks to consumers and compliance with federal consumer financial laws when evaluating the policies and practices of a financial institution unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices which the doddfrank act empowers the cfpb to prevent through rulemaking enforcement and examination rulemaking to implement various federal consumer statutes such as the home mortgage disclosure act truth in lending act real estate settlement procedures act electronic fund transfer act equal credit opportunity act and fair credit billing act and the markets in which firms operate and risks to consumers posed by activities in those markets the statutes and regulations that the cfpb enforces mandate certain disclosure and other requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with consumers when taking deposits making loans collecting payments on loans and providing other services failure to comply with these laws can subject the bank to various penalties including but not limited to enforcement actions injunctions fines or criminal penalties punitive damages or restitution to consumers

maintain reserves at specified levels against their transaction accounts either in the form of vault cash or an interestbearing account at the federal reserve bank or a passthrough account as defined by the federal reserve on march in response to the covid19 pandemic the federal reserve reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero percent eliminating the reserve requirement for all deposit institutions an action that provides liquidity in the banking system to support lending to households and businesses the bank is also a member bank and stockholder of the federal reserve bank of san francisco frbsf dividends and other transfers of funds the principal source of liquidity of east west is dividends received from the bank the bank is subject to various statutory and regulatory restrictions on its ability to pay dividends in addition the banking agencies have an authority to prohibit or limit the bank from paying dividends depending upon the banks financial condition if such payment is deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice furthermore under the federal pca regime the federal reserve or fdic may prohibit a bank holding company from paying any dividends if the holding companys bank subsidiary is classified as significantly undercapitalized or in some circumstances undercapitalized it is the federal reserves policy that a bank holding company should generally pay dividends on common stock only if the companys net income available to common stockholders over the past four quarters net of distributions would be sufficient to fully fund the dividends and if the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the companys capital needs asset quality and overall financial condition it is also the federal reserves policy that a bank holding company should not maintain dividend levels that undermine the companys ability to be a financial source of strength to its banking subsidiaries the federal reserve requires bank holding companies to continuously review their dividend policy in light of their organizations financial condition and compliance with regulatory capital requirements and has discouraged payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels unless both asset quality and capital are very strong transactions with affiliates and insiders pursuant to sections and of the federal reserve act as implemented by the federal reserves regulation w banks are subject to restrictions that strictly limit their ability to engage in transactions with their affiliates including their parent bank holding companies regulations promulgated by the federal reserve limit the types terms and amounts of these transactions and generally require the transactions to be on an armslength basis in general these regulations require that covered transactions which include banks extensions of credit to or purchase of assets from an affiliate be limited to of the banks capital and surplus with respect to any one affiliate and of the banks capital and surplus with respect to the aggregate of all covered transactions with all affiliates in addition a bank generally may not extend credit to an affiliate unless the extension of credit is secured by specified amounts of collateral the doddfrank act expanded the coverage and scope of the limitations on affiliate transactions including by treating derivative transactions resulting in a banks credit exposure to an affiliate as covered transactions in addition the volcker rule under the doddfrank act establishes certain prohibitions restrictions and requirements known as super and super on transactions between a covered fund and a banking entity that serves as an investment manager investment adviser organizer and offeror or sponsor with respect to that covered fund regardless of whether the banking entity has an ownership interest in the fund federal law also limits a banks authority to extend credit to its directors executive officers and shareholders as well as to entities controlled by such persons among other things extensions of credit to insiders are required to be made on terms that are substantially the same as and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons the terms of such extensions of credit may not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features and may not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons individually and in the aggregate which limits are based in part on the amount of the banks capital community reinvestment act under the cra an insured depository institution has a continuing and affirmative obligation to help serve the credit needs of its communities including low and moderateincome borrowers and neighborhoods the federal reserve periodically evaluates a state member banks performance under applicable performance criteria and assign a rating of outstanding satisfactory needs to improve or substantial noncompliance the federal reserve takes this performance into account when reviewing applications by banks and their parent companies to expand branches relocate add subsidiaries and affiliates expand into new financial activities and merge with or acquire other financial institutions unsatisfactory cra performance may result in the denial of such applications on september the federal reserve issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking that invites the public to comment on its proposal to modernize cra regulations by strengthening clarifying and tailoring them to reflect the current banking landscape and better meet the core purpose of the cra the impact on the company from any changes in cra regulations will depend on how they are implemented and applied fdic deposit insurance assessments the fdic insures the banks customer deposits through the dif up to for each depositor per fdicinsured bank for each account ownership category the dif is funded mainly through quarterly insurance assessments on insured banks based on their assessment base the doddfrank act revised the fdics fund management authority by establishing a minimum designated reserve ratio of percent of total estimated insured deposits and redefining the assessment base to be calculated as average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity the banks dif quarterly assessment is calculated by multiplying its assessment base by the applicable assessment rate the assessment rate is calculated based on an institutions risk profile including capital adequacy asset quality management earnings liquidity and sensitivity to market risk ratings certain financial measures to assess an institutions ability to withstand asset related stress and funding related stress and a measure of loss severity that estimates the relative magnitude of potential losses to the fdic in the event of the banks failure as of june the dif reserve ratio fell to percent below the statutory minimum of percent the decline in the ratio was due to extraordinary insured deposit growth which was resulted mainly from the covid19 pandemic specifically monetary policy action direct government assistance to the consumers and businesses and an overall reduction in spending the fdic projects that the dif reserve ratio would return to percent without further action by the fdic and has continued to maintain existing schedule of assessment rates in june the fdic published a final rule that mitigates the deposit insurance assessment effects of participating in the ppp ppplf and the money market mutual fund liquidity facility mmlf under the rule the fdic provided adjustments to the risk based premium formula and certain of its risk ratios and an offset to an insured institutions total assessment amount due for the increase to its assessment base attributable to participation in the ppp and mmlf absent such a change to the assessment rules an insured depository institution could have become subject to increased deposit insurance assessments based on its participation in the ppp ppplf or mmlf programs this final
