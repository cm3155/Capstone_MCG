quarter average loans were billion and grew linked quarter annualized based on our yeartodate results we are updating our loan growth outlook for the full year to a range of to up from to previously all else equal our outlook does imply a slower rate of loan growth in the second half of the year compared with the pace of the first half our current pipelines are healthy our borrowers financial position and liquidity are strong and were very optimistic about the future of east west bank however in an environment of rising interest rate real estate transaction volume is slow impacting commercial and residential mortgage growth also a high pace of ci loan growth in the first half of may moderate due to inflationary supply chain and other macroeconomic pressures given the current economic uncertainty we want to be conservative in our expectations and prudent in our growth total deposits were billion as of june and second quarter average deposits were billion average total deposit grew linked quarter annualized in the second quarter turning to slide earlier in the quarter we repurchased million of common stock or million shares as you can see in the exhibit on this slide our capital ratios are healthy and strong as of june we have a east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 common equity tier ratio of total capital ratio of and a

of june growing by annualized from march i will now turn the call over to irene for a more detailed discussion of our asset quality and income statement irene irene h oh executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc thank you dominic ill start with our asset quality metrics and components of our allowance for loan losses on slides and the asset quality of our portfolio continues to be strong quarteroverquarter nonperforming assets decreased by down to million and the nonperforming assets ratio improved by basis point down to basis points of total assets as of june other oreo and foreclosed assets were down to zero as of june total criticized loans increased modestly to of loans from as of march largely from cre and ci loans early stage delinquency loans decreased quarteroverquarter to million during the second quarter we booked net recoveries of million or basis points of average loans annualized compared to net chargeoffs of basis points of average loans annualized for the first quarter the second quarter recoveries were primarily in ci loans our allowance totaled million as of june a of loans compared to as of march the quarteroverquarter change in the allowance largely reflects the mix of the loan portfolio as of june as well as second quarter loan growth during the second quarter we recorded a provision for credit losses of million compared to million for the first quarter and now moving to discussion of our income statement on page this slide summarizes the key line items of the income statement which ill discuss in more details on the following slide of note amortization of tax credit and other investments in the second quarter was million compared with million in the first quarter this is east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 lower than what we had previously anticipated because of timing we expect the amortization of tax credit and other investment expense to be approximately million in the third quarter and million in the fourth quarter now second quarter income tax expense was million compared with income tax expense of million for the first quarter of yeartodate the effective tax rate for the first six months of was we currently expect that the fullyear effective tax rate will be approximately including the impact of tax credit and investments expected in the second half of the year now ill review the key drivers of our net interest income and net interest margin on slides through starting with the average balance sheet second quarter average loans of billion grew by billion or annualized the strong growth across all loan categories drove a favorable mix shift in average earning assets quarteroverquarter in the second quarter average loans made up of average earning assets compared with in the prior quarter second quarter average deposits of billion grew by million or linkedquarter annualized growth in average noninterestbearing demand deposits cds savings and interestbearing checking accounts was partially offset by a decrease in average money market accounts this quarter we observed customers utilizing their excess funds for acquisitions and investments importantly we saw quarteroverquarter growth in average demand deposits which made up of our average deposits in the second quarter compared with in the first quarter and in the yearago quarter turning to slide second quarter net interest income of million was the highest quarterly net interest income in the history of east west growing by linked quarter annualized the net interest margin of expanded by basis points quarteroverquarter as you can see from the waterfall chart on this slide the net interest margin expansion in the second quarter reflects impact of higher loan and earning asset yields which increased the nim by basis points plus the favorable earning asset mix shift which expanded the nim by basis points this was partially offset by basis points of compression from higher cost of interest bearing funds turning to slide the average the second quarter average loan yield was an increase of basis points quarteroverquarter the average loan yield comprised an average coupon yield of plus yield adjustments which contributed basis points to the overall loan yield in the second quarter as of june the spot coupon rate on our loans was in this slide we also present the coupon spot yields for each major loan portfolio from the last three quarter end periods you can see the positive impact of rising interest rates on each loan portfolio of loans reprice in total of our loan portfolio is variable rate including linked to the prime rate and linked to libor or sofr rates most of these loans we priced at least monthly turning to slide our average cost of deposits for the second quarter was basis points up basis points from the first quarter our spot rate on total deposits was basis points as of june a yeartodate increase of basis points this translates to a cumulative beta relative to the basis point increase in the target fed funds rate over the same period in comparison the cumulative beta on our loans has been as our loan coupon spot rates increased by basis points yeartodate east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 we started the rising interest rate cycle from a position of strength with historically high levels of demand deposits for east west bank strong liquidity and average loantodeposit ratio of in the second quarter these balance sheet characteristics bolster the asset sensitivity benefits of our variable rate loan portfolio supporting strong revenue growth through the cycle moving on to fee income on slide total noninterest income in the second quarter was million down from million in the first quarter customerdriven fee income and net gains on sales of loans were million essentially unchanged from the first quarter and up yearoveryear moving on to slide second quarter noninterest expense was million excluding amortization of tax credits and other investments and core deposit intangible amortization adjusted noninterest expense was million in the second quarter up million or sequentially from a seasonally lower first quarter the second quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was compared with in the first quarter this reflects strong revenue growth and our ongoing disciplined expense management and with that ill now review our updated outlook for the full year of on slide for the full year compared to our full year results we currently expect yearoveryear loan growth excluding ppp of approximately to reflecting yeartodate performance our updated outlook is an increase from our previous outlook of to loan growth yearoveryear net interest income growth excluding ppp in the range of to this is an increase from our previous outlook of net interest income growth ranging from to our updated outlook reflects loan growth as well as the impact of anticipated fed funds rate increases on our assetsensitive balance sheet underpinning our interest income assumptions is the forward interest rate curve as of june with fed funds expected to reach by yearend adjusted noninterest expense growth excluding tax credit investment amortization of approximately to yearoveryear increased from our previous outlook for expense growth of approximately for we currently expect that provision for credit losses will be in the range of million to million for the full year this is up from our previous outlook for provision for credit losses in the range of million to million finally we now expect that the full year effective tax rate will be this is compared with our previous outlook which is for an effective tax rate of to the change in our outlook reflects higher pretax income and a lower amount of tax credit investment as compared with our previous forecast there will be quarterly variability in the tax rate due to timing of tax credit investments placed into service we currently expect that the third quarter tax credit investment amortization expense will be approximately million with that ill now turn the call back to dominic for closing remarks dominic ng chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc thank you irene in closing we have had a great first half of the year and i look forward to delivering strong financial results for our shareholders in the second half of were wellpositioned to navigate the current environment our balance sheet is asset sensitive we have ample liquidity and strong capital our credit quality is likewise strong our associates are focused on providing superior banking services to our customers and i wish to thank them for their efforts and excellent results i will now open up the call to questions operator east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch good morning irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc good morning ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch i guess first question just around loan growth outlook dominic you mentioned about maybe your guidance obviously assumes some slowdown in the back half is that just out of being wanting to be conservative given all the things you laid out or over the last two to four weeks have you actually seen customer appetite to borrow and activity begin to slow down dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc i think mainly from our perspective is that no one really know what the economy is going to be like lets say to months from now while there is a lot of prediction here and there our position is that with interest rate rising naturally there are not going to be as many refinancing on single family mortgages or cre et cetera and even on the ci side we expect that we dont know what the christmas is going to be like this year would consumers still going to be as active in terms of purchasing gifts for families and friends or would they not no one knows at this stage but from east west bank perspective is that while our customers are doing really well we think that at this stage its only prudent for us to expect that there would be a slowdown because it appears to me that logically when rates are rising higher these refinancing activities would slow down and then from the ci side maybe some acquisition or major investment would also may not be happening maybe deferring to future so we just look at it as from an overall perspective is that while our customers are doing just fine we wanted to guide our projection lower to make sure that just in case that economy do go into a direction that in a negative way ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it and i guess one question for you irene give us your assumption on the deposit beta as we think about relative to your nii guidance and just to put a fine point on your nii outlook assuming yearoveryear growth implies exit fourth quarter nii closer to million to million i just want to make sure were thinking about that correctly east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah i think ebrahim your number is pretty close to where i think well end up on the deposit betas i think for east west and really the entire industry weve been able to land the deposit cost so realistically i think were very proud of what weve done yeartodate i want to give a shout out to all of our team members frontlines this variable rate pricing is very challenging but realistically we do expect that deposit beta to increase for the rest of the year with that said with the strong amount of operating accounts that we have the strong amount of the dda that we have a percent of our total deposits overall at this point im very comfortable that our kind of lifetime or a cycle through deposit beta will be much better than what we had in the last cycle operator our next question comes from brandon king with truist please go ahead brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey good morning irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc good morning brandon dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc good morning brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey i wanted to indiscernible loan growth i saw theres pretty strong growth in china in this part quarter i was wondering what are you seeing on the ground there and what youre actually ph facing in sort of second half of the year and if thats also assuming slower growth there dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc brandon i would i have some difficulty hearing your question is that about what is it irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc loan growth second half of the year dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc oh about china oh sure sure well china our yeah well our branch well our china operation and also hong kong operation have done extraordinarily well in the first half of the year because we all saw the headline news from the media about lockdown in shanghai and then all these quarantine requirement in hong kong and east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 so our associates in that region went through some very very tremendous difficulty personally like either most of them being locked up at home while working and a few of them actually locked up in the office for over two months and the fact is they came through throughout this time they not only were able to get the business going and took good care of our clients in fact they even grew loans and deposit so they were doing really well but overall obviously china is only of our balance sheet so in that respect obviously its not going to have a material impact to our overall financial performance but im very very pleased with what they have done and they continue to grow very diverse ci business and that covers from general manufacturing consumer goods entertainment private equity technology clean energy and digital media health care etcetera so they really have done a good job at continuing to diversify their focus and have very highquality customers that they brought in and in addition to that our customers are doing very well as you can see for the last several years now since the us started putting tariffs in place our loan portfolio in china the asset quality is pristine we did not have any kind of like credit issues and they continue to perform well this is because we really believe that our bridge banking strategy understanding of china and our expertise in crossborder business make a big difference indiscernible placed at with east west we have the expertise in crossborder business between us and china that allow us to be able to offer unique value proposition and services that are really important and relevant to the business whether the us business and doing business in china or chinese business doing business in us we do offer a unique banking service for them that 99pluspercent of the banks in the united states dont offer so in that respect we have substantially less competition and were able to choose exactly the high quality customers we want to do banking with so were very very pleased with how everythings going right now so as of today obviously our associates in hong kong and china are all back to the office and doing business as normal so we expect them to continue to be able to do good work for the second half of the year brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay thanks and maybe more of a big picture question as far as indiscernible as of adjusted efficiency ratio reaches a and potentially below i mean what is the kind of the lower for which youve kind of indiscernible in efficiency ratio i know youve done a lot of positive operating leverage rates and is there a potential for you to accelerate some investments particularly next year because of where that efficiency ratio is at irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah i think all the efficiency ratio brandon we dont have a ratio that were trying to append to normally this is the time when dominic goes through the calculation of the numerator and denominator obviously for east west we remain disciplined on spending with that said we have continued to make the investments we think necessary to support our business our cash management products you see that with the outstanding growth we have crossborder as dominic talked about also particularly on the consumer side on the digital side as well also in this kind of environment were a asset sensitive bank so with the revenue increasing obviously that efficiency ratio is adjusted related to that but just to recap we dont just try to guide to our efficiency ratio but we make investments we need to support the business dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 yeah efficiency ratio as report card kind of like number return of equity return of asset the efficiency ratio these are report card numbers so we looked at it and said well proud to be in that position however we really are much more focused in measuring like input such as deposit growth loan growth interest margin expansion asset quality and also making sure that expenses growing according to what the balance sheet call for thats what were trying to work on irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc ill just add that maybe the report card numbers of roa and roe matter more for us operator operator instructions our next question comes from chris mcgratty with kbw please go ahead christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning dominic positive just surprised to see the buyback in the quarter how do we think about perspective uses of the rest of the buyback given the markets the stock valuation but also uncertainty in the macro dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc okay on the buyback well i said it before that the bank is always shareholders friendly but we are relatively i say more prudent and conservative than other banks but we are opportunistic when we do see that its the right time and the right place we do strike and so thats what we did in the second quarter heres what i looked at based on the economic landscape today and looking forward and seeing that the fed will continue to increase interest rates with many economists not predicting good economy going forward we just feel like that now is the time that we probably want to pause and wait and this is a kind of like very consistent east west bank philosophy that when we do feel that its the right time to do something that we have plenty of capital plenty of earnings and etcetera well obviously when the opportunity arise we will step in and do the right thing for shareholders but in the meantime we feel that preserving capital is the better way to go now reflecting back several years ago obviously most banks were actively doing buyback and east west was one of the isolated few that is not but if you looked at what weve done in the last four to five years we have actually almost doubled our balance sheet organically not acquisition organically so obviously we knew we have the engine that can grow and we did not wanted to spend the capital into buyback when we knew that we have plenty of growth opportunity and it didnt hurt when we have plenty of capital right in the beginning of covid and so our position is that well always be very considerate of shareholders return however we always wanted to look at it from a longterm basis and so thats how we come to this conclusion about buyback and not buyback christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you thats great perspective if i could ask one more a common thread throughout the quarter for all the banks ph has been deposits and levels and i think the concern in the market is that with the fed executing  theres going to be a little bit of an air pocket on deposits im sure youve looked over your portfolio and kind of separated what may be at risk but could you share with me share with us any observations about east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 what pieces of the book might be at more risk and how much do you think could actually flow out if the fed does what its going to do thank you dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc i think the key part at east west bank deposit franchise is our retail banking deposit we unlike many regional banks we actually have a very very strong retail banking deposit franchise very stable plenty of customers out there banked with east west bank for many years and theyre the one that normally we do not expect a lot of volatility obviously when rates do rise in a substantial way we do need to make sure we take care of them and pay them higher rate but i dont expect that there will be a lot of movement or volatility from the retail banking side in fact i do expect that we have opportunity to grow even more one good example is that we started a business checking deposit products about a year ago less than a year ago actually just the last six months and we brought in about close to million of dda deposits and we will continue to be able to find opportunity to grow dda balances in these very small business customers and i looked at it is that in addition to that we continue to see activities of overseas investors they are still putting money in the united states and most of them do look at east west of their first choice so from that standpoint we feel pretty good obviously we have commercial accounts that some of them have more volatility due to the operating needs and so forth so those are the ones that we keep a close eye on it but we also feel that because of our deposit rate today we got plenty of room to work with our customers if we do need to pay a little bit higher rate to retain more deposit is something that we obviously have much more flexibility than maybe other banks operator our next question comes from jared shaw with wells fargo please go ahead jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning thanks maybe just following up a little bit on the deposit side when you look at your guidance for nii whats the expectation for overall deposit growth and i guess maybe your sort of loantodeposit ratio in this environment and it sounds like i guess dominic you think that in that scenario you can still see dda balance growth from some of these new initiatives is that the right way to look at it irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc we do expect that deposits will grow for the entire year i think quarteroverquarter especially on an average basis pointtopoint you will see variability for example this quarter as well historically weve had clients one client in particular related to property tax payments made in the second quarter the balances are down and then we saw that this quarter as well with that said i would also just comment on just the granularity and the deposits that we have as dominic mentioned not only do we have kind of a broad base on the retail side small business on the retail side overall on the commercial side as well the deposits are very granular in nature so thats something that we think will continue to help us as we go through the cycle jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 so with that backdrop is that its assuming i guess we should we could assume that youd be comfortable getting that loantodeposit ratio back north of if the loan growth is there irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yes if the loan growth is there weve commented on this before high low is something were very comfortable with again particularly with the granularity of the deposits that we have dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc yeah we dont have a problem of growing our loan balances due to like a pressure from deposit because at this 80pluspercent loantodeposit ratio we have plenty of room so we just the reason that we do not have a very high expectation of high loan growth for the second half despite the fact that we have good pipelines and good momentum is because the economic outlook overall does not look very good but if it turns out that we continue to find highquality loans that we can book and we will simply because we got plenty of deposits to support it jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks and then just as a follow up as my second question looking at the expense guide and the increase there is that primarily just performance based on better revenue drives better performance incentive comp or are there some new initiatives in there for the franchise dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc we always make incremental investment i mean every single year i mean east west philosophy is never really do a major major big project and load it in one year and that cost so volatility of our earnings so well continue to invest and of course there are some inflationary factors in here simply because of wages and other type of miscellaneous expenses all have gone up because we saw a consumer price index number that came out recently so our position is that we feel that while we are managing our expenses very prudently we expect that it will go up slightly so thats why were guiding it up from increase to to increase operator our next question comes from clark wright with da davidson please go ahead clark wright q analyst da davidson companies good morning this is clark wright on for gary tenner this morning irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc good morning clark clark wright q analyst da davidson companies hi there my question pertains to loan growth in the guide so i guess just assuming you have lower pace of growth in the second half i mean it wouldnt be surprising given the first half growth but could you maybe the east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 pipeline going into the third quarter and whether or not your projections assume a dropoff in the fourth quarter or if the dropoff is balance between the third and the fourth dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc so we at this point again the projection is more or less how do i put it we are just being prudent just because we have pipelines sometimes pipeline does not result in funding our projection right now is that yes there may be a lot of deals in the making but i expect that there will be some prudent investor which are our great customers who will look at it maybe two months from now three months from now and if rate continue to go up like what the fed expected to do they come to a conclusion that maybe i shouldnt move forward and i just kind of looking at it on the downsized scenario there may be a lot of deals that people were thinking about doing and then im not doing and those are the kinds of things that were anticipating i mean a very simple answer will be like on a residential mortgages area we would expect that people that may expected to revise their mortgage decided not to because the rate is so high it doesnt make sense or if you expected to buy a home buy a second home or third home decided not to again because rate is high price havent come down yet enough to make it a good deal these are what i call the transitional time transitional time in a way that when the price still stay pretty very much up there but then the interest rates suddenly make the economic less attractive so that would discourage people making investments indiscernible say or maybe make investment in certain type of business theyre involved with so this is the kind of logic that we are going through in our mind that despite the fact that our relationship managers out there and our branch managers out there are having bringing in more new clients and more opportunities to do more deals we just looked at it as that naturally people would just take a break when they are not sure having some certainty about what the horizon would be which is very different that once you get into a recession or maybe once you get the tail end of the recession people are jumping in left and right taking advantage of the distressed prices and so forth so in this standpoint what we see right now is that we are just assuming that maybe in the third and fourth quarter well transitioning slowly into that kind of uncertain path however if for some reason things change and for the positive obviously we will expect a strong loan growth clark wright q analyst da davidson companies thank you all my other questions have been answered dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc thank you operator this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to dominic ng for any closing remarks dominic ng chairman chief executive officer east
