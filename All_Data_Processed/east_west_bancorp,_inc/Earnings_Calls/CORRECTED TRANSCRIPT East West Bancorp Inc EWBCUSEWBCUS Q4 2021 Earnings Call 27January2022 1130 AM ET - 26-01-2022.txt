entertainment and general manufacturing and wholesale throughout the year ci growth for us has been diversified across our lending teams geographies and specialized verticals from we expect that ci growth will continue to be well diversified in our outlook we are assuming that current line utilization levels are unchanged an improvement in utilization will provide upside to our current

to report that during the course of all asset quality metrics substantially improved total criticized loans decreased sequentially by to million as of december and decreased by yearoveryear the criticized loan ratio improved by basis points to of total loans as of december down from of loans as of december quarteroverquarter nonperforming assets decreased by to million as of december the change in nonperforming assets in the fourth quarter reflects payoffs and upgrades of ci loans and the sale of a commercial real estate owned property yearoveryear nonperforming assets were down by the nonperforming asset ratio improved to basis points of total assets as of december down from basis points of total assets as of december total oil and gas commitments were million and balances outstanding were million as of december we are comfortable with the portfolio size of under billion in commitments for this sector yearover year the risk profile of these borrowers has improved substantially on slide we present the components of our allowance for loan losses our allowance totaled million as of december of loans excluding ppp compared with million or as of september the quarteroverquarter change in the allowance reflects improvements in real estate metrics for our cre loan pools and a better operating backdrop for the oil and gas exposures this was partially offset by higher downside scenario weightings due to uncertainty related to the pandemic and the current omicron variant we believe that the allowance coverage ratio will continue to moderately decline in the coming years fourth quarter net chargeoffs were million down from million in the third quarter the fourth quarter net chargeoff ratio was basis points of average loans annualized an improvement for basis points annualized for the third quarter for the full year of the net chargeoff ratio was basis points compared to basis points for the prior year assuming the economy continues to improve we believe that the net charge offs for the full year will modestly improve from full year levels during the fourth quarter we recorded a negative million provision for credit losses same as in the third quarter and in line with our guidance for the full year of we recorded a negative million provision for credit losses largely due to an improved macroeconomic forecast partially offset by allowances required for the billion growth in the loan portfolio east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 and now moving to discussion of our income statement on slide this slide summarizes the key line items of the income statement which ill discuss in more detail on the following slides the noninterest income included in interest rate contracts and other derivatives and marktomarket adjustments which were million in the fourth quarter compared with million in the third quarter these primarily relate to changes in the cba on this slide the cba marks are included in the other line of noninterest income amortization of tax credits and other investments decreased this quarter to million compared with million in the third quarter quarteroverquarter variability and the amortization of tax credits partially reflects the impact of investments that closed in the given period the effective tax rate for the full year of was which was the same rate as in ill now review the key drivers of our net interest income and net interest margin on slides through starting with the average balance sheet fourth quarter average loans of billion grew by million or linked quarter annualized and excluding ppp by billion or annualized during the quarter we deployed cash and cash equivalents into higher yielding loans and securities average loans securities and retail agreements increased by billion and interestbearing cash and deposits with banks yielding basis points decreased by million fourth quarter average deposits of billion were up by million or linked quarter annualized led by growth in noninterestbearing demand deposits which increased by million or annualized our average loan to deposit ratio was in the third quarter unchanged from the third quarter we previously communicated that were comfortable operating with a loantodeposit ratio up to the low percent range although core deposit growth is always a focus for east west a loantodeposit ratio with the starting point of today provides us with flexibility to withstand deposit pricing pressure in a rising interest rate environment showing up the asset sensitive nature of our loan portfolio turning to slide fourth quarter net interest income of million was the highest quarterly net interest income in the history of east west growing by linked quarter annualized excluding ppp net interest income grew by annualized in the fourth quarter income related to ppp loans was million in the fourth quarter consisting of million of deferred fees and million of interest income as of december we had million of ppp deferred loan fees remaining to accrete into income on a million loan book the gaap net interest margin expanded to in the fourth quarter an increase of basis points from the prior quarter excluding ppp the fourth quarter adjusted nim of expanded by basis points sequentially as you can see from the waterfall chart on the slide the adjusted net interest margin expansion in the fourth quarter reflects the favorable earning asset mix shift combined with the lower cost of interestbearing deposits turning to slide the fourth quarter average loan yield was and excluding the impact of ppp the adjusted loan yield was unchanged from the third quarter of our billion in variable rate loans as of december billion had fully indexed rates below floors of which billion were basis points or less from their floor rate another billion were to basis points from their floor rate turning to slide our average cost of deposits for the fourth quarter dropped to basis points an improvement of basis points from the third quarter the spot rate on total deposits costs was basis points as of december also down by basis points from september the cost of deposits declined as we continued to reduce higher rate accounts and grow lower cost deposits the average cost of cds in the fourth quarter was basis points a decrease of basis points from the third quarter in the fourth quarter we originated or renewed billion of domestic cds at a blended rate of basis east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 points and a weighted average duration of four months the repricing of maturing cds to lower rates has reached an equilibrium moving on to fee income on slide total noninterest income in the fourth quarter was million compared with million in the third quarter customer driven fee income and net gains on sales of loans were million essentially stable from the last three consecutive quarters and up yearoveryear quarteroverquarter growth on lending fees and deposit account fees were partially offset by lower interest rate contract and other derivative income revenue and lower gains on sales of sba 7a loans yearoveryear the growth in foreign exchange income deposit account fees lending fees and wealth management fees largely reflects new customer acquisitions and increased transaction volumes particularly for cash management and foreign exchange beyond the rebound from covidrelated troughs of beyond quartertoquarter volatility were positive about the trends in our fee income businesses and momentum for ongoing growth in and beyond moving on to slide fourth quarter noninterest expense was million excluding amortization of tax credits and other investments and core deposit intangible amortization adjusted noninterest expense was million in the fourth quarter an increase of million or sequentially this expense growth was driven by higher bonus and incentive compensation expense in the fourth quarter related to full year business activity and higher charitable contributions for the full year of the adjusted noninterest expense of million was up yearoveryear the fourth quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was compared with in the third quarter and in the year ago quarter the full year adjusted efficiency ratio was also and improved by over basis points from and with that ill now introduce our full year outlook for on slide for the full year we currently expect yearoveryear loan growth excluding ppp for approximately similar to growth in excluding ppp we expect welldiversified loan growth in driven by strong production from all of our major loan portfolios and led by commercial and industrial loans we are assuming that our current ci utilization rate of stays unchanged in our outlook yearoveryear adjusted net interest income growth excluding ppp in the range of to this reflects loan growth as well as the impact of anticipated fed funds increases on our asset sensitive balance sheet underpinning our interest income assumptions is a forward interest rate curve as of january which assumes four fed funds rate hikes in in march june september and december in our modeling we are factoring in a beta on our deposits adjusted noninterest expense growth excluding tax credit investment amortization of to yearoveryear as we benefit from rising rates in our revenue growth we expect to reinvest a portion of that revenue back into our business investing in people technology to support our strategic initiatives we expect our revenue and expense outlook to result in positive operating leverage yearoveryear in terms of credit items for we currently expect that the provision for credit losses will be below million we anticipate a modest improvement in the full year net chargeoff ratio which was basis points in we expect the full year effective tax rate will be approximately to in line with the effective tax rate of in this includes the impact of tax credit investments there will be quarterly variability in the tax rate due to timing of tax credit investments placed into service with that ill now turn the call back over to dominic for closing remarks east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 dominic ng chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc thank you irene in closing was an outstanding year for east west i wish to thank our team of over associates for their unwavering dedication and hard work throughout the year and enabling us to serve our customer with excellence while delivering strong financial performance i also want to take this opportunity to wish everyone a happy new year and a happy early lunar new year which is coming on february next tuesday i hope the year of the tiger brings health and prosperity to all of us i will now open up the call to questions operator question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc and maybe so just if you could start with deposit so period end balances were relatively flat quarteroverquarter if you could give us some perspective around what youre assuming in terms of deposit growth i know irene you referenced the low loan to deposit ratio im just wondering do you expect a meaningful rise in that ratio through the course of this year and how we should be thinking about incremental deposit growth especially in light of all the investments you made on the treasury management side irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc great question indiscernible customer kind of activity we did see kind of flattish deposit growth but also as we noted in our call and in the financials you can see that the average deposit growth was still quite good and ill point out that yeartodate thus far deposits have rebounded as i mentioned the customer activity was a driver for the deposit balance right at for realistically whats going to be the driver for our earnings ebrahim is going to be the loan growth and as i mentioned in the prepared remarks obviously deposit growth is always a priority for east west maybe just slightly less of a priority in with our modeling were assuming about a deposit growth in dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 well let me just maybe add on also core deposit growth specifically noninterestbearing operating accounts thats what weve been focusing on for the last several years many of our investments that we made throughout the years incrementally every single year was to the payment and system and also digital banking for both of commercial and consumer and really going at looking at the commercial clients that we have and then figure out how we can best serve our commercial clients which have result in tremendous growth in our noninterestbearing demand deposit as we indicated in the call that is it was as of december so we will continue to drive those deposit growth but the situation at east west is that as you have seen that we have much higher deposit growth than loan growth for the last year or two and we have a loan to deposit ratio at so obviously we dont have a need to chase deposits we just want it to keep growing high quality core deposits and thats part that well continue to focusing on but in terms of do we need deposit to support our asset and loan growth the answer is not so obviously because of that reason we are more comfortable to put more focusing on the lending side ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc understood and just as a followup you referenced strategic priorities dominic in indiscernible earlier just wondering if you can elaborate on that like where youre making investments and how we should think about that manifesting on revenue growth either on the fee income or the lending side dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc we are making investments sort of like in the technology we continue to focusing on also treasury management area in terms of how do we further and better improve our paymentrelated products cash management ph products and in addition to that as i just mentioned earlier digital banking both consumer and commercial we also are putting more emphasis on wealth management and this is an area we see that there is going to be great opportunity for us in the next to years and we are putting more investment to that now in addition to it we are adding on new bankers both for consumer banking wealth management and also commercial banking this various industry verticals that we started some of them over years ago some of them only the last two or three years we can add on additional bankers to grow the business in addition to that we are also growing geographically we did mention i guess right in the middle of the pandemic in we started our office in chicago obviously for four months or so we couldnt do anything because right in the middle of pandemic but that little office in chicago have started making very decent commercial banking business growth in so we expect that to grow even further so we will continue to look at some of the other geographic field and that we think that will be sort of like areas that make sense for east west to expand into so one by one i think adding people adding to appropriate type of product capability and further enhancing our technology and overall enterprise risk management all of those are the areas that we will incrementally improve in and beyond ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you operator our next question comes from chris mcgratty with kbw please go ahead christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 hey good morning irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc good morning christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc dominic i want to ask about the outlook for ci i think in your prepared remarks you said youre assuming stable utilization in the guide i guess twopart question what do you think it will take to see that move up and then if it did move up a point is there a rule of thumb for how much incremental growth that would lead to dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc well if this incrementally improved im pretty sure that that would obviously increase the loan growth in terms of outstanding balances irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah chris i can share like when we look at that as we mentioned the utilization hasnt increased substantially quarteroverquarter and in fact very similar to yearoveryear numbers as well when we look at kind of the utilization for the clients prior to the pandemic compared to the current levels with these customers if we went back to prepandemic levels its about billion increase christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats great and secondarily the im interested in your comments around the fee income opportunities i think you touched on wealth management the higher how should we think about just the evolving rate environment and how that might affect your capital markets business which moves around quarter to quarter irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah i think on the capital markets partially the volume is so low in the fourth quarter we did have higher kind of a fee income related to our broker dealer but and thats in that other income line item so i think that might be what youre referring to chris overall for wealth management look at that i think that was also part of your question yearoveryear weve grown that nicely and we expect in well continue to grow that as well dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc yeah its an area that i would say that is going to be multiyears priorities that if i look back like maybe six seven years ago that i wanted to really put in effort in terms of improving treasury management like cash management and also foreign exchange and then as of today we see the numbers have grown substantially higher than it was five years ago and so and the wealth management area is another one of those high potential area that we think that three or four years from now that we look back the number is going to be substantially higher than it is today east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 operator our next question comes from jared shaw with wells fargo securities please go ahead jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc good morning julianna balicka a directorinvestor relations corporate finance east west bancorp inc good morning jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc i guess circling back on the guidance with the tax rate whats the assumption for tax credit amortization costs on that offset irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc let me get that for you right away i believe were assuming about million of tax credit amortization for the full year of jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks and then looking at credit obviously its had great improvement as weve gone through the year with the allowance ratio now looking like its a little bit below the day one cecl whats the impact of the improved energy ph the improvement in the smaller energy book on that and as we look out through the year what do you think a natural flow is given the economic environment for the allowance indiscernible total loans ratio irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah thats a great question so as of our year end the allowance for the energy book was about million and that certainly is lower yearoveryear and definitely lower than where we were day one cecl overall when we look at the trends for the allowance we do expect it to come down from these levels to million that were at million exppp oil and glass sic gas that portfolio ph certainly plays a factor of that especially as the portfolio size decreases and as you can see from the metrics that weve provided the credit quality and the performance has continued to improve but i would also say that as the allowance the absolute dollars and the balance has come down and i think thatll be less of a factor for the allowance in and the required ratios more so the rest of the portfolio in particular honestly probably the cre portfolio in and the metrics and the driver for that will have the largest impact for the allowance operator our next question comes from dave rochester with compass point please go ahead east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good morning guys dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc good morning irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc good morning david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc on the good morning on the nii guide i just want to understand what youre expecting to be the impact of each basis point rate hike that youve got in here and then whats the level of mediumterm interest rates that youre assuming and the securities growth that youre factoring in as well thanks irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah great questions right now with our modeling and the guidance we expect the impact would be about million per hike in were not assuming real growth in the securities book now some of that really the driver for that will be the liquidity and looking at what happens with the deposit growth but were not assuming any major changes in that and i think you mentioned the rate the kind of the indiscernible curve actually has flattened a little bit and that is also something that weve factored in with the guidance and the nii increase related to rates julianna balicka a directorinvestor relations corporate finance east west bancorp inc and this is julianna david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc got it indiscernible david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc go ahead julianna balicka a directorinvestor relations corporate finance east west bancorp inc east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 indiscernible yeah let me clarify one comment from irene the million as she said per hike thats over a full year basis so if the hikes are coming in at various points in time youre not youd just have to factor the time of timing also david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah that makes sense and then so for medium term interest rates it doesnt sound like youre assuming that those move out much from here irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc correct david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc got you irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc most of the nii growth that were factoring in really is from the growth of the loan book and in fact really even without rate increases we do expect that the increase in nii would be about david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc perfect and then as my second question just on fee income just had solid growth in youve already talked about the enhancements you made to treasury management youve added indiscernible as well what are your thoughts on growth for at this point do you think that the pace we saw in would be appropriate to project in irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah total fee income grew over yearoveryear as were kind of modeling for i dont know if were going to expect that level of growth in particular i would say that we had some items that may not recur in that happened in some of the sbic investments we had a lot of kind of equity pick up from their positive cva adjustments so were not modeling that but we do expect that core customer related fee income will grow nicely yearoveryear and were assuming roughly about on that operator our next question comes from casey haire with jefferies please go ahead casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah thanks good morning irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 good morning casey haire q analyst jefferies llc just want to follow up on the asset sensitivity appreciate the million per hike but just what are the deposit beta assumptions that are being input for that kind of sensitivity irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah with the modeling were assuming total deposit beta for interest bearing honestly compared to like the last cycle were assuming no change but of course with the overall portfolio the mix that we have higher level of dda deposits much higher level of operating accounts we do expect a lower overall deposit beta of or so casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay so that is through the cycle not necessarily for the first couple of hikes irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc thats right and the leading question there but our assumption is the first couple of hikes the beta is going to be lower casey haire q analyst jefferies llc got you okay and then just the liquidity deployment obviously a nice move in the fourth quarter on a period end basis youre down at billion is there more room to go can you just give us a reminder as to where what sort of your minimum comfort level is there irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah id say there is a little bit more room to go our pace of that really is a function of evaluating what our liquidity needs are whats happening with the deposits but overall there is probably a little bit more room to go on that operator our next question comes from brandon king with truist please go ahead brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey good morning dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc good morning east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 brandon king q analyst truist securities inc so yeah i wanted to first touch on loan growth specifically in cre and i wanted to know what was the assumption for pay downs this upcoming year theyll be lower or higher compared to i know some banks have mentioned how higher interest rate environment could lead to lower payoffs and i was wondering if that had any impact on your guidance dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc yeah i think we are hoping so too in fact with the well first of all there were a lot of refi activities for the last year or two and i think that a lot of our clients are very sort of like gone through the refi exercise and the other thing indiscernible picking up a little bit i expect maybe a little bit less of those type of activities going on so hopefully that would help reduce the pay down and in fact its part of our assumption for we do expect a slightly less pay down than we experienced in brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay and then on the expense guide i was wondering what the composition of the growth in expenses is expected to be particularly for compensation i know so growth in is that expected in as well based off of the current outlook and potential bonus and incentive payouts irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah the increase in the expected noninterest expense is largely related to compensation and employee benefits brandon were a growing organization were expecting to grow the loan book dominic mentioned kind of new hires and new teams in chicago riding throughout from the front office perspective and also the back office and most of the noninterest expense increases not that dissimilar to the activity that you saw in honestly or compensation will be the largest driver for that but with that we expect hopefully very soon afterwards revenue growth as well operator our next question comes from brock vandervliet with ubs please go ahead brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc good morning brock brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc i just wanted to good morning irene i just wanted to confirm that number say the nii would be up ex hikes east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah thats our expectation correct brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it and im kind of surprised that four hikes dont add more irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc no we i think indiscernible irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah part of it is the shape of the curve part of it is the timing i think its also as were evaluating it we talked about the deposit betas and then also the one of the other factors is were assuming kind of what the shape of the curve also maybe a little bit compression on the loan side so we want to be realistic with our guidance with that and the timing of that and again this is just right we do expect further growth afterwards julianna balicka a directorinvestor relations corporate finance east west bancorp inc and dont forget the fourth hike in december has very little impact and the third hike is also late in the year so it sounds four hike sounds impressive until you work it out over the course of the year irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc wed be happy to work through the model with you brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay and theres a followup just in terms of general commercial ph calling efforts the client growth that youre seeing is it what we would associate with a chinese ethnic bank or are you of the size now where many of these new relationships have no ties to that whatsoever dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc we are getting both i mean thats what thats one of the reasons why youve been seeing this consistent sustainable profitable growth at east west bank and we have the advantage of when we compete like a regional bank with banks within the us footprint we obviously have many different industry verticals and in some good geographical area and that would cover those ci business quite well and cover those ph cre business quite well and then we also have the crossborder banking activities that continue to have sustainable growth if we looked at the last four years with this tariff and uschina sort of trade situation that is happening that didnt stop east east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 west from growing and we continue to see growth coming from crossborder banking business and in our consumer banking side we are the dominant financial institution in the retail space when it covers the chinese american customers from single family mortgages home equity lines and also consumer deposit et cetera and then of course foreign exchange business so we are going well with continuing to expand in both areas and so far we have full confidence that and beyond well see similar trend operator our next question comes from gary tenner with da davidson please go ahead gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co thanks good morning just as youre thinking about loan growth in and obviously you gave the guide on that in the growth ended up being very well distributed among the three main loan segments so just asking if your expectations include any sort of shift in where more loan growth comes from in versus dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc yeah in fact what you notice is that we have in the past residential mortgage tend to be the lead and then cre ci and we started from the third quarter in and onward ci are taking the lead and naturally because i would expect in from what we see in the rate environment and the activities from the in the past few years refi market for singlefamily mortgages probably slowed down a little bit so we wouldnt expect single family mortgages to have those like in fact a few years ago 20plus percent kind of growth so most likely were expecting ci to be the lead to grow faster than cre and singlefamily in fact as our outlook we are predicting a little bit higher growth in ci and then steady growth both from cre and singlefamily mortgages gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co can you tell us what your mix of refi and purchase was in singlefamily for dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc yes irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc i dont know if i have that mix for the full year but our originations definitely pivot towards a purchase versus refi operator our next question comes from matthew clark with piper sandler please go ahead matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co hi good morning dominic ng a chairman president
