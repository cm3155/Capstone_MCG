outlook its unchanged assuming the forward curve as of yearend its unchanged from our september updates we continue to expect a fullyear endofperiod loan growth in the range of to and i would note weve grown approximately through the end of the third quarter we also expect fullyear net interest income to still decline in the range of to and yeartodate our net interest income has declined with that ill now open the call for additional questions operator east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 question and answer section operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question is from manan gosalia with morgan stanley please go ahead christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc good afternoon manan manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good afternoon good afternoon i wanted to check in on the deposit growth rate it looks like you grew deposits at a faster pace than loans yet again can you talk about the rationale for that are you deliberately working towards a lower loantodeposit ratio and building more liquidity or did it just happen that you were able to grow deposits faster and do you expect that that gives you more flexibility for funding loan growth as we get into christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc thank you manan for the question yes we think it affords us more flexibility as youll note we actually lowered deposit pricing during the quarter and have continued to lower it here into  and have still benefited from net inflows and so well take this organic net inflow and think about how that can help us optimize our liability profile as we move forward but its been nice wind in our sails manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and then the midpoint of the guide implies nii slightly down from levels is that a function of lower rates and i know you have some swaps maturing in so can you just remind us how you expect nim and nii to trend over the next few quarters christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc i would say that were inside of the range i didnt say wed be at the midpoint or one side or the other but i feel pretty good about the  dynamics and i would say that the swaps wont really have an impact until  and we do think they will come off throughout the quarter and  end of january into february and they will have a positive effect i think weve previously quantified that north of million run rate into the numbers manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you operator the next question is from dave rochester with compass point please go ahead east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good afternoon guys christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc good afternoon dave david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc just on capital it seems like its just hard to keep that tce ratio down and i know you got some help of lower rates this quarter but just wanted to get your updated thoughts on buybacks as tce continues to grow here it kind of seems like were going to hit that level without buybacks unless balance sheet growth really continues at a strong pace here so any update there would be great christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc sure we were targeting that sort of 949ish level without the aoci we were right there obviously we are thankful for the pickup in aoci that brought that level closer to but we continue to be patient and opportunistic in our approach to capital and well continue to look for opportunities to optimize the balance sheet as we move forward david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay great and then just on liquidity management will the cash continue to grow here assuming deposits exceed loan growth or is the plan to start to plough those into or continue to build the securities book here and any thought to going with some fixed rate stuff here just to reduce the asset sensitivity christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc so ill take those theres two different parts first part on the deposits i think were taking a look at our deposit pricing and being very disciplined about that and well continue to do so that may lead us to runoff some of the higher cost deposits as we move through  and that will be perfectly fine we are not necessarily looking to overleverage or further leverage the balance sheet and we will obviously be very focused on driving the right optimization on the second part of your question fixed versus floating i think weve been thoughtful about that weve benefited from the strong opportunities to put money to work in floating weve put a little bit of money to work in fixed and with the backup in rates that weve seen here particularly over the last month a few opportunities have presented themselves so well be thoughtful about putting on the right mix in that portfolio we will have million to million of portfolio churn every quarter and so were looking at that portfolio and constantly reoptimizing the position david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc all right great thanks guys east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc sure operator the next question is from jared shaw with barclays please go ahead jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc hey good afternoon christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc good afternoon jared jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc thanks yeah just sticking with the capital observation or discussion youve referenced in the past that youre not in the business of warehousing capital but weve seen it grow consecutively over the last few quarters and no buyback this quarter what other with the expectation for growth where it is what else could we expect in terms of capital management out of you if were not going to see the buyback here christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc yeah obviously our first and highest priority is to be there for our customers and to meet their needs and weve seen relatively slower loan growth than we might have otherwise desired but that will continue to be our growth priority second priority would always be a competitive dividend and i think we will be very thoughtful as we approach yearend and into next year about where that should go given our outlook third as we consider nonorganic opportunities from time to time and well continue to have some dry powder to explore those if and when appropriate and lastly well do the buyback and well continue to be very patient and thoughtful and diligent about how we approach that and make sure that were making the right call on the first three before putting money to work in the fourth jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay all right thanks for that and then on the deposit side youve had a lot of success growing growing time and it sounds like the pricing on the new offerings is working in your favor is there a sort of a maximum percentage of deposits youd like to see time deposits or youre happy to get the money in the door here at these prices christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc i think we looked at the opportunity to bring the money in earlier in the year during our lunar campaign special as the opportunity and i would at the risk of dominic writing me a further negative note in my year review we went out a little higher than he was comfortable with at with the idea that wed be able to roll that down the curve east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 at lower price points through the year i would note that were seeing good retention on those new deposits that we brought in from those customers this year and were rolling them over today at and so despite the fact that the fed has only cut basis points our cd pricing has essentially dropped prospectively by basis points already and well continue to feed positively so i think our timing of that was bring them in early roll down the curve as the fed moves and that seems to be working in our favor right now jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc great thanks operator the next question is from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good afternoon christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc good afternoon ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc so i guess maybe just following up on loan growth like i was looking back since loan growth ci or consolidated has been about to would love to hear your thoughts maybe chris and maybe if dominic if you could share a perspective from a client standpoint once we get out of the elections does it feel like we return back to that highsingledigit loan growth for east west next year if the economy continues to kind of progress as it has over the last to months dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc so from our ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc yeah dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc okay from the banks perspective we have plenty of capital that we just talked about chris just mentioned earlier so we have all the flexibility to do what the clients sort of demand well well see how the election goes right and so right now i mean i think it will be unwise for me to make too much of a prediction because since like all the media calling for a close race and we dont even know the race will finish in one day or not so in that standpoint i think that what our position is that east west just got to take care of east west business and in the east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 way that we always positioned ourselves with a fortresslike balance sheet and very strong cushion in terms of our capital and we have great customers that we work with and when the opportunity arise that call for higher demand of loans from our customers obviously well respond and naturally then well have a higher loan growth rate but if for some reason the economic condition is still kind of like a little bit muddy and then make it difficult for customers to function and make capital investment or trying to accelerate growth we naturally will slow down a bit so i think what happened this year i would say is somewhat unusual to the normal east west bank loan growth pattern this year our customers are holding off and you can see it in the utilization rate we normally add about 70plus and drop to in this quarter and thats basis point of difference so if customer continue to be concerned about whatever uncertainty theres out there that caused them to not wanting to draw down the loans and then i think our loan growth would not be strong but what we noticed is that despite these reduction in loan utilization east west still find a way to grow our ci loans because were adding new customers we continue to add new customers were confident in well continue to add new customers but in terms of our existing customers whether they will do a bit more drawdown or not i think that well have to wait to see how the economy goes and then whatever circumstances dictate what they would do christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc and to further on that maybe ill just note weve seen commitments continue to grow in fact commitments grew this quarter in a period where we only grew endofperiod and average loans so we grew commitments faster than outstandings echoing the point that dominic made about utilization trends but if we look yearover year its actually up and so the reality is our customers have continued to engage with us theyve continued to come to us to talk about opportunities theyve continued to put credit in place they just havent pulled the trigger on it yet and so were optimistic that if the right conditions present themselves it could be a good year for us to be ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful and i guess just the other question around investments when we look at i mean i was looking at the branch count yearoveryear its been around and remind us in terms of team hiring any new markets or any of your regions on slide where youre adding branches or offices be it in the united states or there are opportunities in greater china christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc so were not currently contemplating opening additional branches in additional markets and we dont have any current plans to further or deepen our network across china we do have a rep office in singapore that weve talked about at what point in time itd be appropriate to upgrade that but that call hasnt been made and will be in the future but we continuously look at our branch network and weve done some pruning and well do some replacements but were not entering new markets ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and if i may follow up chris if i heard you correctly on capital priorities you did mention nonorganic opportunities i dont think of east west as superacquisitive bank just talk to us what may make sense i mean i east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 know elections might have an impact but either from a bank standpoint are there nonbank deals that would also make sense for the bank thank you christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc yeah last year the bank made a fairly significant investment in an asset management company i think those kind of feedriven opportunities are always going to be of interest i think our appetite for depositories is light right now ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful thank you operator the next question is from timur braziler with wells fargo please go ahead irene h oh a executive vice president chief risk officer east west bancorp inc hi timur timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good afternoon hi just looking back on the deposit conversation can you maybe just provide us some color around what the churn is for time deposits in and then chris you had made some comments about your willingness to maybe let some higher cost dollars walk in if they choose maybe quantify that statement as well please christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc yeah sure so weve got about billion of cds thatll roll here in the fourth quarter another billion thatll roll in the first quarter of and about another billion behind that in the second quarter of the rest are spread out into future periods we are being very active around anything thats not accretive to what happens if we take the incremental dollar and put it just in fed funds given that weve got a pretty hefty cash position it has to be incrementally accretive and so were not doing anything thats high frankly anymore and were continuing to move everything to at or below our cd special rate which is currently timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks and then maybe just looking at fee income strong quarter in im just wondering to the sustainability of those results is there anything that was maybe ratedriven where the frenzied last month drove some of those higher revenue per user is that million million level is that a good run rate here in the near term christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc yeah look i think the core fee business number has benefited from a lot of trends rate volatility has helped some cases on the engagements with our rates teams the positive markets have facilitated some great but east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 focused sales efforts by our wealth management teams so those dynamics are real but obviously if the market conditions change that could soften but nonetheless were pleased by the efforts of our sales teams and we would largely ascribe it to good and focused sales efforts that have driven our results here over the last couple of quarters which have both been record quarters dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc i do want to point out that the fee incomes growth wealth management private banking these fees obviously maybe rate environment do have something to do with equity market situation but i will say for the east west bank situation is relatively less influenced by the rate environment and obviously you can see it in the line items on our earnings release which shows that depository fee income continue to grow from cash management side and also foreign exchange and then so its really hitting in all the areas and from the loan side mainly some syndication fees when we need syndication so those are really our efforts that i would say more that we are very pleased with these kind of like incremental growth and we expect that well continue to work on these areas whether its cash management treasury management services that we provide to sophisticated clients for their operating accounts or the foreign exchanges services that we offer and interest rate hedge plus continue to be the lead lender to do more syndication these are things that all are important for east west bank in order to help us to continue to have meaningful sort of core banking growth in the future timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it and then maybe one last one for irene it looks like commercial real estate nonperformers declined pretty nicely in but then if you look at the allowance build the all other cre line that actually ticked up quite a bit im just wondering what drove that incremental reserve build irene h oh a executive vice president chief risk officer east west bancorp inc yeah well first i would just want to clarify the allowance doesnt just warrant necessarily nonaccrual loans or substandard loans the drivers for those as far as the allowance and mix shift there we do still have a fair amount of qualitative factors not just the quantitative and we look at it from the perspective of is there enough coverage regionally are there things that were looking at et cetera so not necessarily something very specific related to one loan just from more broad base but overall for the real estate portfolio in specific as far as the loan portfolio its something that we continue to actively monitor but overall were comfortable as far as the grading the allowance level and just overall how were monitoring the portfolio timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you operator the next question is from matthew clark with piper sandler please go ahead matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co hey good afternoon everyone east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc good afternoon matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co can you remind us or update us on what deposit beta youre assuming for this easing cycle christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc sure weve assumed todate that would have a or better beta which seems to materialize for us here over the last several weeks matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay through this cycle not obviously initially but through the cycle christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc yeah matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay great and then just on your adjusted noninterest expense growth going to be in that to range this year any reason to believe that might slow or should we assume you kind of sustain that level of growth as you march toward becoming billion in assets christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc i think we continue to look at that obviously well go and have some conversations with the board here about budgets and outlooks for next year and itll be somewhat growth dependent but i would continue to expect that we will continue to make the investments we need to be the bank that we want to be and that will be probably a slightly faster spend rate than longerterm historical averages but again i would remind folks that to off a base is a lot less than that kind of growth off a efficiency ratio or something matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co yeah thank you operator the next question is from chris mcgratty with kbw please go ahead christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 oh great chris coming back to the nii for a moment i mean it feels like nii should be flat to up in the fourth quarter i guess what would it take for nii to be down in  christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc look it depends on how many rate cuts there are at this point i think the yield curve was assuming at quarter end we are asset sensitive that would put downward pressure were assuming were going to have asset growth that will positively offset that and get us to something better than down and thats what were shooting for but the function is if fed surprised us with basis points were probably not going to get there with another basis points thats dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc on top christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc on top of it yeah so christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc so we see november and december tides like in kind of orderly fashion that would support perhaps nii growth in the fourth quarter is what youre saying dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc yeah christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc orderly to small modest fed cuts as were sort of projected at quarterend and that were very responsive as we were on managing deposit costs lower and that we see asset growth puts us in the right frame for a good outcome and if we fall short of that youll see it in january but i think we feel pretty good about where were heading dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc or we have to christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc work harder east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc or we have to work harder christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thanks for that and then maybe just broadly on billion you guys have really made a dent on the hqla can you just remind us how youre thinking about the allin costs as you i know youve got several years but how youre thinking about just planning in the overall pl thanks dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc yeah youre right we have plenty of time but on the other hand we do not wait weve been working towards at one point and i dont know when but at some point were going to be over billion i mean one thats a fact that we will be over billion its just that when so our position is that we will continue to just work in a rational way to build up all the appropriate infrastructure that is needed to be at that level so our senior executives are wellaware of the rules and the criteria and what we have currently that already met the requirement of what we potentially have a gap and what kind of resources that we need to field in both human resources and also technology or infrastructure resources et cetera so we are in a very disciplinary manner and working towards the goal of at some point well be ready and the likelihood is that well its not just likelihood we will be ready before we turn into a billion thats the position christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks dominic operator the next question is from ben gerlinger with citi please go ahead benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc hey good afternoon christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc good afternoon ben benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc i was wondering chris i think you gave the cd balances for  and beyond i was curious if youd be willing to give the rates the only reason i ask is because i think you have a little bit of pig in the pipe on lunar new year and if im recalling it correct it was a six month so it goes kind of and so seven is kind of at the like if we do two cuts i think is there a reasonable expectation to kind of see roughly basis points lower on cd pricing in assuming we get another basis points25 basis points from the fed east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc yeah look i think as we look forward ben what we have observed in  is that we got roughly about basispoint savings in  versus what we did in  so thats there and your question is will we potentially see something similar as we roll into first quarter look i think well see how the yield curve shapes out were benefiting today from the fact that the forwards have got those next two rate cuts priced in so if we get to the first quarter and theres still additional cuts priced in which the yield curve says there may be well probably see that kind of savings again benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got it okay so its kind of at the same time you also see the swap ph hedging reprieve thats a positive for sure when you think about just kind of client conversations a lot of banks have kind of been for most of the year theyre positive on growth and then walked it back because of growth didnt materialize are your clients saying anything in terms of like a catalyst point on rates i know you talked through a couple of silos are we looking for just another basis points at the start of the calendar next year are people pointing to anything specifically that kind of might spark an inflection higher dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc well i mean theres really no i mean clients are not in this line of business that we are so they dont think about these sort of like a fed fund rate all the time but its really and also its a mixed bag of people from all different industries so everyone have their own view its just in general rate as we looked at two months ago and then even today its still relatively high and so we do expect that when by just conversation with our different customers from different industries that with rate being where it is makes it a little bit difficult for them to make substantial investments or maybe acquisition and whatnot and then also with rate being where it is right now other than folks that are really good at distressed asset that look into commercial real estate opportunities i would say by and large a lot of the traditional real estate investors that are not in the distressed category they may not necessarily feel this is the right time to make acquisition and so all in all i would say that thats what just overall in the whole banking industry the lending side has been the demand of the loans has slowed down a bit but well see how it goes as long as there is indication from the fed that they will continue to drop rate and not necessarily abruptly in a big way they just do basis point basis point and then continue to make x number of cuts next year and i do believe that that sort of message would most likely cause many business to start picking up and have the confidence to move forward benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got you thank you operator the next question is from samuel varga with ubs please go ahead samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 hey good afternoon christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc good afternoon sam samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc chris on the cd specials that you mentioned were those sixmonth specials christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc yes samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc okay great and then just on the beta if im sort of looking at the commentary you gave on the past progress youve made on deposit costs i guess i kind of get to like a quartertodate beta on total deposits given the maturities you laid out for the next three quarters here on cds is there one quarter where the step down between the roll and rolloff rates is such that you expect to make sort of a bigger stepup in the cycle to the betas or should we expect more of a gradual path towards the mark that you laid out christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc i think its more of a gradual path and again the beta through the cycle feels very achievable based on what were seeing here in the first rate cut but thatll be proven out with the next couple but i think were comfortable that thats a good guidepost for now and that will be fairly gradual and consistent assuming the fed as dominic just said is sort of kind of cut path samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc understood thanks for taking the questions operator the next question is from andrew terrell with stephens please go ahead christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc good afternoon andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc hey good afternoon hey chris just wanted to clarify a couple of points from the prepared remarks the to 10basispoint drop in deposit costs so far in october you mentioned was that total or interestbearing deposits east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc 5ish for total 10ish for interestbearing or closer to basis point for total closer to basis point for interest bearing andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc got it okay easy enough okay and then the million positive impact from the swap rolling off is that prior to rate cuts does it assume or make an assumption around kind of the forward curve or is it just as is kind of today christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc that was kind of the end of quarter number right so weve seen the first million i think if youd asked me that in august i would have cited a number closer to million and so it comes down and itll come down a little bit itll get chipped away at with each fed action but itll still largely roll indiscernible andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc yeah okay got it just wanted to doublecheck thanks for taking the questions operator operator instructions showing no further questions this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to dominic ng for any closing remarks
