previously all our major loan portfolios grew this quarter with the strongest growth from commercial loans excluding ppp followed by commercial real estate total deposit reached a record high of

total deposit as of march up from from december turning to slide quarteroverquarter our book value per share declined by largely due to a negative change in the accumulated other comprehensive income

east west bancorp inc thank you dominic ill start with our asset quality metrics on slide im pleased to report that asset quality of the loan portfolio continue to be strong ph in this first quarter the total criticized loan ratio decreased by basis points sequentially of loans held for investment criticized loans of million were essentially unchanged from december quarteroverquarter nonperforming assets decreased by down to east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 million the nonperforming asset ratio improved by basis points down to basis points of total assets as of march on slide we present a component of our allowance for loan losses our allowance totaled million as of march or of loans excluding ppp compared with million or as of december the quarteroverquarter increase in the allowance reflects loan growth whereas a decrease in the coverage ratio reflects an improving forecast and improving asset quality quarteroverquarter net charge offs declined and were million down from million in the fourth quarter the first quarter net chargeoff ratio was basis points of average loans annualized an improvement from basis points annualized for the fourth quarter during the first quarter we reported a provision for credit losses of million compared to a reversal of million for the fourth quarter and no provision in the prior year quarter and now moving on to discussion of our income statement on slide this slide summarizes the key line items of the income statement which ill discuss in more detail on the following slides in noninterest income as part of the interest rate contracts and other derivatives line item from marktomarket adjustments which were a positive million in the first quarter compared with in the fourth quarter of these primarily relate to favorable changes in the credit valuation adjustment or cva on this slide these cva marks are included in the other line item of noninterest income amortization of tax credit and other investments in the first quarter was million compared with million in the fourth quarter quarteroverquarter variability in amortization of tax credits partially reflects the impact of investments that closed in a given period the effective tax rate for the first quarter of was compared to for the fourth quarter we currently expect that the full year effective tax rate will be in the range of to the quarterly effective tax rates on a go forward basis will decline as more tax credit investments close and projects go into service correspondingly the tax credit amortization expense will increase over the course of the year for the second quarter of we currently expect to book a tax credit amortization expense of approximately million ill now reveal the key drivers of our net interest income and net interest margin starting on slides through and well start with the average balance sheet first quarter average loans of billion excluding ppp grew by billion or annualized the strong loan growth across all asset categories drove a favorable mix shift in average earning assets quarteroverquarter in the first quarter average loans made up of average earning assets compared with in the prior quarter first quarter average deposits of billion declined by million or linked quarter annualized primarily due to a decrease in noninterest bearing demand deposits partially offset by increases in average interestbearing checking and savings deposits demand deposits made up of our average deposits in the first quarter compared with in the fourth quarter and in the year ago quarter turning to slide first quarter net interest income of million was the highest quarterly net interest income in the history of east west growing by linked quarter annualized excluding ppp net interest income grew by annualized in the first quarter income related to ppp loans was million in this quarter the gaap net interest margin of expanded by basis points quarteroverquarter as you can see from the waterfall chart on this slide the net interest margin expansion in the first quarter was driven by strong loan loss which resulted in the favorable earning asset mix shift as well as higher yields on loans and other earning assets turning to slide the first quarter average loan yield was an increase of basis points quarterover quarter the average low yield comprised an average coupon yield of plus yield adjustments which east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 contributed basis points to the overall loan yield in the first quarter as of march the spot coupon rate on our total loans was the positive impact of rising interest rates on our portfolio will be more evident in the second quarter average loan yield as of our loans are linked to the prime rate which did not increase until midmarch in this slide we also present the coupon spot rates for each major loan portfolio for the last three quarter and periods or billion of our loan portfolio is variable rate and most of these loans will be repricing on a monthly basis also note that of our billion in variable rate loans billion have fully index rates below floors as of march of which billion or basis points or less from their floors and another million or to basis points from their floor rate turning to slide our average cost of deposits for the first quarter was basis points unchanged from the fourth quarter the spot rate on total deposits was basis points as of march up by basis points from december we are starting a rising interest rate cycle from a position of strength with record level of demand deposits for east west bank strong liquidity loan to deposit ratio of under turning to slide total noninterest income in the first quarter was million up from million in the fourth quarter customerdriven fee income and net gains on sales of loans were million an increase of linked quarter or annualized quarteroverquarter customerdriven interest rate contract revenue increased reflecting improved customer demand as interest rates rise wealth management fees net gains on sales of sba loans and deposit account fees also increased quarteroverquarter moving on slide first quarter noninterest expense was million excluding amortization of tax credits and core deposit intangible amortization adjusted noninterest expense was a million in the first quarter down million or sequentially during the quarter decreases in legal expense and overall operating expenses more than offset increased compensation and employee benefits which is typically seasonally higher in the first quarter due to higher payroll taxes and related expenses the first quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was compared with in the fourth quarter and in the year ago quarter and with that ill now review our updated outlook for the full year of on slide for the full year of compared to our full year actual results we currently expect yearoveryear loan growth excluding ppp of approximately to reflecting yeartodate performance current loan pipelines which are very robust our updated outlook is an increase from our previous outlook up loan growth yearoveryear net interest income growth excluding ppp in the range of to this is an increase from our previous outlook of net interest income growth of to our updated outlook reflects loan growth as well as the impact of anticipated fed funds rate increases on our asset sensitive balance sheet underpinning our interest income assumptions is a forward interest rate curve as of march with fed funds expected to reach by year end adjusted noninterest expense growth excluding tax credit amortization up yearoveryear which narrows our previous outlook of expense growth in the range of to as our revenue grows from rising interest rates we expect to reinvest a portion back into our business investing in people and technology to support our strategic initiatives we expect our revenue and expense outlook to result in positive operating leverage yearoveryear in terms of the credit items for we currently expect that the provision for credit losses will be in the range of million to million this is higher compared with our previous outlook which was for provision for credit losses under million we continue to anticipate a modest yearoveryear improvement in the full year net chargeoff ratio which was basis points of average loans in we now expect that the full year effective tax rate will be approximately to this is higher compared with our previous outlook which was for an effective tax rate of to our outlook includes impact of tax credit investments it also factors in the east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 increased income we now expect there will be quarterly variability in the tax rate due to timing of tax credit investments placed into service with that ill now turn the call back to dominic for closing remarks dominic ng chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc thank you irene well in closing we are off to an excellent start for the year and look forward to delivering strong financial results for our shareholders in global volatility notwithstanding we are well positioned to navigate the current environment our credit quality is strong our balance sheet is asset sensitive we have strong capital and ample liquidity to support growth but most importantly our associates are focused on providing superior banking service to our customers i wish to thank them for their efforts and excellent results i will now open the call to questions operator question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch good morning irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch just firstly i mean it sounds like youre relatively optimistic for the loan growth outlook would love to hear a little more detail around just how borrower demand played out during the course of the quarter and have you seen incremental supply chain snags impacting customer sentiment since the war began at the end of feb and just in terms of when you think about loan growth from here if you could give us a sense of cre versus ci versus residential how you think that mix playing out dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc in terms of the loan growth we are looking at our pipelines if i look at the current pipelines a lot of the ci loans that we are working on whether some of the private equity or entertainment technology and healthcare and other general manufacturing and consumer goods and so forth all of these business that weve been working on with the clients so its all in the process of trying to make it happen in the second quarter so we feel pretty good about whats coming and then how to what extent that business will or will not be affected by the external environment east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 we feel pretty good about a lot of the deals in the pipeline really would not be having much impact by for example this russiaukraine war is so tragic from a humanitarian perspective but theres really hardly any bearing to our customers business that were dealing with and thats one for the ci for the commercial real estate again we have clients that are in the midst of maybe closing deals that we are working with and so those are the deals that we feel pretty certain again in the second quarter would be closing same thing for the single family mortgages whats in our pipeline is something that we expected that to be funded it takes certain period of time to get loans funded so we feel pretty good about what we expect to be coming out in the second quarter obviously the longer the horizon the harder for us to predict you ask us about what would your fourth quarter loan growth would be like well at this point we dont have as much visibility as we have for the second quarter because second quarter we see the numbers that were working on it looks very healthy but how lets say the third and fourth quarter will develop i think that external environment will have a lot to do with it and then well see how it goes ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch okay and just one bigger picture question dominic if i may theres a lot of chatter for a bank that has cross border presence in china theres been a fair amount of discussion on deglobalization potential for further deterioration in uschina relationship how do you handicap and protect the bank from a risk standpoint the fact that indiscernible sentiment around the stocks would love to hear how you think about managing risk if uschina relations were to deteriorate further dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc well we dont necessarily protect bank from these challenges we actually excel in these challenges east west have always done extraordinarily well whenever there are some things that from a perception standpoint looks bad and in reality we actually have come out way ahead of our peer banks but let me just address your concern maybe one by one first and foremost ive said it before our greater china including china and hong kong loan portfolio is only of our total loans and of our loans are domestic in the us and that includes like commercial real estate thats as local as you can get because as real estate you cannot move it which is of total loans and residential mortgage is of our total loans so our loan portfolio in china hong kong also is very well diversified by industry ranging from general manufacturing consumer goods technology entertainment to digital media et cetera and the credit profile of these customers also is excellent with strong balance sheet and high level of liquidity across all of our loan portfolio so i will say that in both china and us it all comes down to diversification and granularity are the most important factor for us to manage risk so i feel pretty good about you look at so much of our of our total loan portfolio out of that are based in us and majority of them are either residential or commercial real estate and then many of the domestic ci loans from entertainment our private equity healthcare and digital media are all domestic in nature so the exposure from china is very minimal as to begin with and even within china that are very very strong credit quality business and is also welldiversified so from that perspective we feel very very comfortable where we are today now but going back to what i talked about we dont necessarily look at we need to protect from the uschina dynamic we actually excel is that when we look at uschina scenario we actually always find opportunities when people shy away from it and the fact that you have seen what we have done in the last four years in fact i would say fiveandahalf years now ever since the beginning of the trump administration east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 that us declared trade war against china yes there is clearly disruption to the international trade per se but east west was able to find our niches and we continue to have pristine asset quality that we didnt take any losses due to this sort of trade tariff that went on for few years and we continue to find way to grow the business so i looked at it as when you looked at where we are today and then we can reflect back on maybe for the last years ive been involved with east west bank and in so we doubled our size during the indiscernible financial crisis in we doubled our size during the global financial crisis well today we werent able to just double our size in one year but since the trump administration started taking on the reign in us in to today weve doubled our size also we took a little bit longer but we doubled our size organically so all im trying to get at is that east west bank always will find a way to grow our business and we have history to demonstrate that in years and thats facts thats not rhetorics and the other thing i wanted to point out is that going back to your concern about deglobalization or maybe decoupling between us and china if you talk to the expert in the business by the way im talking about even political expert the us trade representative katherine tai janet yellen who is the secretary of treasury raimondo whos the secretary of commerce and each and every one of them have never once declared that us wanted to decouple in fact they all continuously highlight that engagement but we do need to find a way to more effectively engage with china those are the kind of words coming out from these sort of expert in the area there are other experts obviously that you see it from the media that talked about yes us china we need to decouple and so forth and deglobalization but those are the folks that are selling books and selling military weapons so really on that the same like the one who actually we need to run the business we at east west bank we are expert in terms of managing our book of business we understand uschina relationship better than most everyone in the country were in the risk management business so we feel very confident about where we are today in terms of the credit quality and the potential risk of the uschina decoupling which quite frankly is extremely unlikely and in addition to that we also feel that besides the unlikelihood of decoupling that globalization in the world is also extremely unlikely it took about years or so for the world to work together with china to create a supply chain infrastructure its not that easy to deglobalize it in five or even years and its something that once people really understand the nuances and exactly what it takes to build this supply chain and they understand that its never going to be that easy to have this decoupling i think that uschina would just have to continue to work through their differences and there are challenges in terms of philosophical differences values and so forth theyre going to need to find a way to work it through what weve noticed just recently china in fact the peoples bank of china and the state administration of foreign exchange on april i think just issued measures to help business impact by the pandemic and six of those measures directly related easing of crossborder trade and payments so those are kind of things that china has been working on to try and to make sure they can get the economy going also and every now and then when we see these kind of opportunities comes out those are opportunities that east west also will be able to take advantage of and the key things for us when we get down to the end is that we are a bank that have very unique value proposition we understand that business and we have shown for many years and have proven for many years we know how to navigate through this uschina relationship and continue to be able to have sustainable growth and we feel very confident that in the next many years well continue to be able to outperform our peer banks because of this unique value proposition operator our next question comes from chris mcgratty with kbw please go ahead east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey great thanks for the question dominic i just wanted to dig into the guide a little bit really good outlook im having a little trouble getting to your net interest income i think my notes suggest it should be a little bit higher given the growth in the margin setup so i guess the question is what are the assumptions embedded for deposit growth deposit betas maybe the missing component is the size of the balance sheet but it feels like the guide is awfully conservative irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc well chris im glad to hear you say that were very tired and i wanted to just start by saying were very positive on the outlook and our ability to execute as dominic mentioned the pipeline is very strong particularly as were going into the second quarter with that said though i think were also realistic of the increased kind of macro uncertainty with the war rising rates as well although we have no direct exposure to the war in europe so with that said and when were modeling out when we also use multi scenarios as far as looking up we share during the last call that we started this year when we thought rates were going to increase basis points at a deposit beta assumption for the full year of so were definitely higher from that chris as were modeling for the full year given rates are expected to increase a bit more than that and also related to that i would say that when were looking on the asset side i think were trying to be conservative as far as were positive about the loan growth but in this type of rising rate environment without any credit issues i think were trying to be conservative about kind of any kind of spread pressures that might be there with that said i just want to say we are starting this environment a rising rate environment from a position of strength best ever at east west record ddas of average deposits at period end and then a loan deposit under and weve talked about it before we have operated and comfortable operating up until low christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thank you for that dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc yeah one thing i want to point out also at is that we normally east west bank normally built momentum more like in the third and fourth quarter and in the first quarter normal i wouldnt call it a struggle first quarter normally is like a indiscernible but this year i think we are in a much substantial better position we have a very strong quarter and we feel that our pipeline in the second quarter looks pretty decent and so once you get two strong quarters in a row and pretty much we feel pretty good that for the rest of the year its hard to not have strong financial performance christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you for that i guess my follow up would be the beta helps irene on the increase in betas what are you assuming for deposit growth because weve seen some of your peers with commercial books have notable kind of chunkiness this quarter i was just wondering but you guys had doubledigit growth im just trying to get a little bit more color on what youre assuming for just deposit flows east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah we are not assuming the same level of deposit growth as we are on the loan side as we just talked about realistically we dont think we need it and also realistically in this kind of environment the kind of deposit growth that we had in probably not likely to occur so we are expecting a lower level of deposit growth but still i would also comment that all our team leaders all our rms and our cash management sales team are all very busy bringing in and core deposits which we expect to continue to grow from retail and commercial customers dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc yeah let me just also highlight that we have not deemphasized deposit growth despite the fact that we have this kind of loantodeposit ratio but we are getting all our frontline people to focus on growing core deposits core deposits we want every time every any day but what im looking at is that if you look at the deposit growth last year in fact the last two years we actually accommodated our clients excess liquidity quite a bit we really did not need that kind of deposit growth for the last two years but these are good clients they have tremendous excess liquidity and we are more than happy to accommodate them but i just dont see that our clients will continue to have this kind of excess liquidity so we do expect that the deposit growth would taper quite a bit from last year operator our next question comes from dave rochester with compass point please go ahead david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good morning guys nice quarter dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc thank you irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc thanks dave david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc i was wondering if you could just dig into the noninterest bearing deposit growth for the quarter that was exceptional and it is as you guys have noted previously or i guess chris have noted previously that not that many of your competitors were able to put up numbers like that this quarter on that trend so just wondering is that primarily the treasury management guys efforts that are driving that or is there anything else thats driving that growth and then how are you thinking about that going forward and then i have a follow up after that irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 yeah dave there wasnt anything really unusual as far as the nature of the deposit growth some of our customers with the activity they have honestly and their businesses balances were up especially compared to the average for the quarter point to point nothing unusual or no industries or anything specific but as i mentioned the teams are hard at work bringing in core deposits so thats something we expect to continue david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay so youre expecting to continue to see that noninterest bearing growth remain pretty healthy here in the near term irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah maybe ill clarify i definitely expect we will be bringing on more core deposits core deposits operating accounts and with that growing dda balances with that said there is a certain amount of liquidity that with the rising rate environment there may be disintermediation into other asset classes other deposits and i think were realistic about that but overall growing core deposits customers thats something were very positive about david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc how are you guys thinking about using the earnings credit rate from here to keep that growth going in noninterest bearing irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah certainly thats a factor for some of our clients dave the way that we look at it were very practical to these indiscernible whether you pay out of interest expense or noninterest expense we view it the same way so we all look at that in a different way we look at the economics of that david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay thanks guys irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc thank you operator our next question comes from jared shaw with wells fargo please go ahead jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey good morning thanks maybe shifting over to fee income some really good strength there in interest rate contracts and derivatives as well as just sort of overall how should we be thinking about that was there anything unusual this quarter that is unlikely to go and i guess it would be a good base going forward on that east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah thats a great question overall there wasnt anything unusual ill draw your attention to slide of our deck where we break out the mark to market now thats not unusual but it fluctuates and quarter over quarter and the marked positive mark to market was higher for the cba adjustment but aside from that from a core fee income perspective fx wealth management the irc and the deposit accounts we expect to continue to grow that yearoveryear jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks and then on the securities portfolio it looks like was that a reclass of securities into heldto maturity or you actually buying different product class to start building that out and how should we be thinking about the breakdown of securities and the growth of that going forward irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah great question during the quarter in fact effective february we transferred billion of our afs securities into htm on a go forward basis and just depending on the duration there may be new securities we purchase into heldtomaturity quartertodate for the second quarter theres been a little bit but not significant so that mix i dont think it will change dramatically the pace of what well buy into that depending on rates and depending on kind of our expectation around whats happening with that in our portfolio well buy more but probably at a lower level operator our next question comes from casey haire with jefferies please go ahead casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah thanks good morning everyone irene maybe just following up on that question on the securities book is there an appetite to maybe run that that securities portfolio lower as a percentage of earning assets and potentially fund some of this loan growth going forward from there irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah absolutely i think that is something we would evaluate just kind of depending on kind of what the spreads that were earning and what makes sense as far as our overall balance sheet as you know we generally look at the securities book really to make sure that we have enough of liquidity and were not necessarily trying to balloon that out but certainly with the rising rate environment this is something that were having more discussions with our alco committee as well as far as what the right mix is casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay very good and just following up on the loan growth you guys are off to a very strong start linked quarter annualized with ci commitments up which is very positive leading indicator on the potential growth nearterm i know theres obviously a lot of visibility into the fourth quarter but just wondering why the loan growth guide is in a little bit stronger than that midteens levels is it just general conservatism or do you see something more substantial to slow down the loan growth going forward east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc well i think as we said earlier we look at where we are today we are very pleased that the fourth quarter momentum continued to spilled over into the first quarter and then looking at second quarter still got a lot of legs going i mean so thats all good and then what i like most about it is that its coming from all different sectors so this whole thing that we worked so hard for the last ten years to get more granular to more diversified portfolio is working exactly what we planned almost a decade ago and so multiple engines are all producing and then we always looked at it and one particular period of time maybe a few of them would do better than the others and then everythings kind of evened out but well it just happened that the last two or three quarters in a row that we actually have multiple factors multiple units all going strong now that said as i said earlier we have inflation today that is at a somewhat of a unprecedented situation for the last decade or two and then we also have this war going on between russia and ukraine which while i said that we have no bearing to east west bank business the fact is it is clearly a fact of macroeconomic environment and so when we start looking at all these different things and the pandemic is not over yet we do need to have to be realistic about to what extent how would interest rate spike by the fed would affect for example the residential market and to that extent indiscernible some point of time the rate get high enough that make it not likely for people to do transactions so we look we take that into effect and i would say that i dont want to get too overly excited about what just because its momentum going so strong now that maybe by the fourth quarter were still seeing that kind of momentum now i do have one way to look at it from a positive note is that one there is maybe a less mortgage origination for single family there is less paydown too so netnet the growth rate may not be that negatively impacted even with a rate hike same thing for commercial real estate were not going to originate as many cre i would think in the second half of this year however therell be less paydown so netnet our loan growth may still be very strong but thats what we hope the direction is going to be but without having a lot of clarity about the interest rates spike impact how exactly does russia and ukraine situation would develop and to what extent will affect the overall global supply chain and how pandemic would actually continue to have new variants coming up all of that if we start looking at it i do feel that we wanted to make sure were being prudent to project the second half of the year operator our next question comes from brandon king with truist securities please go ahead brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey i had a few questions on loan growth some of the answers may have been implied in some previous answers but with ci utilization increasing in the first quarter what is implied in the guidance as far as where that utilization level stays in the near term dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc we assume that utilization stay around the same we have not sort of like put any additional growth in the utilization rate to get the assumption of our outlook brandon king q analyst truist securities inc east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 okay and then irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc were ph excited about the growth brandon but it is also just dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc yeah is brandon king q analyst truist securities inc yeah yeah yeah i know a lot of other banks are seeing utilization growth so im just wondering if theres maybe potential upside there irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc well i think thats also the power we indiscernible right were going to be able to grow without utilization increases and thats indiscernible brandon king q analyst truist securities inc got it got it and then for cre that was strong as well i want to know how much of the growth in the first quarter how much of that would contribute to slower paydowns irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc there definitely was a decrease in paydowns in the first quarter especially compared to if you look at the back half of last year but i would also say we had increased originations so the combination of both brandon operator our next question comes from brock vandervliet with ubs please go ahead vilas abraham q analyst ubs securities llc hey everyone indiscernible vilas abraham for brock i just wanted to dig into resi mortgage for a minute i get that your business model is a bit different than most but even given that the origination volume seems pretty resilient here just flat yearoveryear when most competitors are down is there a share gain happening there is there any other color you can offer around that dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc well actually relatively speaking i mean if you recall going back to our earnings release for the last few years residential mortgage always that the leading category in terms of our loan growth always outgrew cre or cni for the last few years and actually two quarters in a row residential mortgages are falling behind compared to the other two relatively relatively speaking and which is obviously by nature if you look at the external environment i east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 would expect that residential mortgage growth will continue to be more challenging as you look at it we used to have like 20pluspercent growth a couple of years ago were down to in the first quarter and we expect that the second quarter maybe down even a little bit more and then i would expect that even by the fourth quarter maybe down to single digit so thats the way i looked at it is that the external environment and make the refinancing very challenging and it may also discourage homebuyers to purchase home when rates spike to over five indiscernible over it would be like when you get to even or something its going to be very discouraging for homebuyers to buy home so the likelihood that we do a lot of resi refi or purchases is low now that said as i just said earlier paydown will drop substantially because for the last few years we just churned a lot of the loans like we originate in high volume we also have paydown in a high volume simply because many of our existing customers just refinance their mortgages for a lower rate and we just do a lot a bunch of work for ph the same net number so i looked at it in particularly the latter half of the year i would say that the origination volume should drop substantially however the paydown also would drop substantially hopefully well still have some net growth but wed pretty much expect that in the majority of the loan growth will be coming from ci and cre and less so from single family mortgages vilas abraham q analyst ubs securities llc got it thats very helpful and just as my follow up and maybe slightly bigger picture question so this rate hike rate hike cycle has barely started and the efficiency ratio at east west is already looks to already be below where it was when the last hike cycle was well underway so just wanted to see if you could help us understand just what may have changed in the profile here thats helping you guys achieve such stellar efficiency and maybe even a sense of how low it could reasonably go over time thanks irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc well we never manage the bank to the efficiency ratio i think thats something that weve made clear on these calls and that certainly isnt something thats in any of our metrics or our drivers but with that said and also related to that we have continued to make the investments that we think are appropriate for the bank for our clients for our strategies and i think those continued investments and successful investments are part of the reason our efficiency is low if you look at it the other side of it really is if you look at our balance sheet and the composition simply were wellpositioned right now for a rising rate environment credit is also very benign although obviously not factored into the efficiency ratio but nonetheless the additional kind of operating costs related to a credit cycle are not here so i think its the combination of all of these factors but certainly thats something that will be very important for us as we go forward were continuing to make the investments that we think are appropriate and then also reap the reward on the revenue side operator our next question comes from gary tenner with da davidson please go ahead gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 thanks good morning my questions have largely been asked and answered but just regarding the guide on the provision expense is that increase purely function of the higher loan growth guide for the full year or any other factors any changes to the cecl model that are driving that number any harder irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc well great question it is largely a function of the higher loan growth gary i think also as you know we run multi scenarios as far as for cecl calculation so just evaluating that and with a little bit of the uncertainty for the future with that said i think i said in our prepared remarks as well credit quality is very benign continues to be and thats our expectation for the full year gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co thank you operator our next question comes from matthew clark with piper sandler please go ahead matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning first question just on the trade finance portfolio can you just remind us how big that portfolio is at the end of the first quarter and how that portfolio has performed from a growth perspective with the supply chain disruption freeing up to some degree dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc well in terms of that portfolio i think that its going its just going fine i mean we have not have much for the last four years we have not had much growth in that portfolio i mean naturally so from a trade finance perspective i mean theres a couple of reasons one is that with the trade tariff plus the pandemic that affect the supply chain and also we have to recognize that the international trade finance business its really something i would say is more or less like an older business model with the advance in technology we have less and less of that that require the traditional international trade finance from banks a lot of the payments today done electronically are much easier and faster so we at east west bank actually while we are actively involved with the crossborder banking business a lot of our crossborder banking business actually are involved with some ecommerce and then to digital media and entertainment business and private equity business and then most of those business that there are crossborder elements but not necessarily require us to provide letter of credit support and so forth yeah so thats what we are but the business is still going solid and i dont know irene do you have any numbers that you wanted to share irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah quarteroverquarter we are up in trade finance thats partially i think seasonal with the year about million east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay julianna balicka a directorinvestor relations corporate finance east west bancorp inc balance of the portfolio was about million and were not up about million irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc oh yes clarify yes were up about yeah balance was million thank you julianna matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay thank you and then just a housekeeping item i think you gave us the amortization expense for the upcoming quarter of million how should we model that for the full year irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc so matt for the second quarter we gave you the million and then if you look in our slide deck on the outlook slide we also provide for you our expectations for the full year amortization expense in the range of million to million and its a range because it kind of depends on when projects close and go into service and kind of the mix of the projects so i would say is that picked up second half of the year and at this point probably split it evenly between the two quarters operator our next question is a follow up from chris mcgratty with kbw please go ahead christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc oh great thanks irene i just wanted to go back a little bit to the efficiency question before and im not sure if its a matter of operating leverage spread to revenue but is there a floor where you would be uncomfortable running the efficiency ratio irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc we dont have a floor operator this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to dominic for any closing remarks
