item risk factors the section titled risk factors in part i item of our annual report on form 10k includes a discussion of the many risks and uncertainties we face any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition including capital and liquidity or prospects or the value of or return on an investment in ally the information presented below provides an update to and should be read in conjunction with the risk factors and other information contained in our annual report on form 10k except as presented below there have been no material changes to the risk factors described in our annual report on form 10k the covid19 pandemic is adversely affecting us and our customers counterparties employees and thirdparty service providers and the adverse impacts on our business financial position results of operations and prospects could be significant the spread of covid19 has created a global publichealth crisis that has resulted in widespread volatility and deteriorations in household business economic and market conditions including in the united states where we conduct nearly all of our business the extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our capital liquidity and other financial positions and on our business results of operations and prospects will depend on a number of evolving factors including the duration extent and severity of the pandemic covid19 has not yet been contained and could affect significantly more households and businesses the duration and severity of the pandemic continue to be impossible to predict as is the potential for a seasonal or other resurgence after its initial containment the response of governmental and nongovernmental authorities many of their actions have been directed toward curtailing household and business activity to contain covid19 while simultaneously deploying fiscal and monetarypolicy measures to partially mitigate the adverse effects on individual households and businesses these actions are not always coordinated or consistent across jurisdictions but in general have rapidly expanded in scope and intensity for example in many jurisdictions governments have acted to temporarily close or restrict the operations of automotive dealers and as a result we have recently experienced a significant decline in our origination of consumer automotive loans and leases the effect on our customers counterparties employees and thirdparty service providers covid19 and its associated consequences and uncertainties are affecting individuals households and businesses differently and unevenly many however have already changed their behavior in response to governmental mandates and advisories to sharply restrain commercial and social interactions as a result in the near term our credit operational and other risks have generally increased and for the foreseeable future are expected to remain elevated or increase further the effect on economies and markets whether the actions of governmental and nongovernmental authorities will be successful in mitigating the adverse effects of covid19 is unclear national regional and local economies and markets could suffer disruptions that are lasting a prolonged economic slowdown for example could result in more severe and enduring declines in new and used vehicle sales and downward pressure on used vehicle values which could adversely affect our origination of consumer automotive loans and leases and the performance of our existing loans and leases for a significant period of time in addition governmental actions are meaningfully influencing the interestrate environment and financialmarket activity which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition during the first quarter of the most notable impacts to our results of operations were a higher provision expense for credit losses and a decline in the fair value of our portfolio of equity securities our provision expense was million for the first quarter of compared to million for the first quarter of with the increase primarily driven by million of incremental reserves associated with a deterioration in macroeconomic variables such as unemployment our loss on investments during the first quarter of included million of unrealized losses as a result of changes in the fair value of our portfolio of equity securities compared to million of unrealized gains for the first quarter of primarily due to the unfavorable market conditions associated with covid19 with the spread of covid19 in the united states having only begun to accelerate in march our forecast of macroeconomic conditions and operating resultsincluding expected lifetime credit losses on our loan portfoliois subject to meaningful uncertainty evidence of nearterm negative effects and trends however has surfaced for example we experienced declines of approximately in our consumer automotive loan applications during the second half of march and to a slightly lesser degree this trend has continued into april this correlates with downward pressure on the automotive sales and other operating results of our dealer customers on their capacity to accept the return of leased vehicles and on usedvehicle auction activity and values declining sales and limited operations at dealers also reduced demand in our insurance operations for consumer products such as vsc and gap protection during the second half of march and this trend and the resulting decline in written premiums have continued into april for more detail and further discussion refer to the section titled significant business developments related to covid19 within the mda ally financial inc form 10q governments have taken unprecedented steps to partially mitigate the adverse effects of their containment measures for example in late march the cares act was enacted to inject more than trillion of financial assistance into the us economy the frb has taken decisive and sweeping actions as well since march these have included a reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate to to percent a program to purchase an indeterminate amount of treasury securities and agency mortgagebacked securities and numerous facilities to support the flow of credit to households and businesses we also have acted swiftly to support our customers with industryleading programs and at the same time manage our credit risk for example in our automotive finance business existing customers may elect to defer their loan payments for up to days without late fees being incurred but with finance charges continuing to accrue as of march approximately or approximately of our existing consumer automotive customers had enrolled in this loan modification program and approximately of these enrolled customers had requested a 120day deferral through april the number of enrolled customers increased to approximately million for dealers with current accounts we have offered for up to four months a waiver of curtailments on wholesale floorplan loans an increase in floorplan advance rates a deferral of interest and insurance charges on wholesale borrowings and a deferral of term loan payments as of march approximately or approximately of eligible dealers had requested at least one form of this assistance for more detail and further discussion refer to the section titled credit quality indicators in note to the condensed consolidated financial statements and to the section titled risk managemen t within the mda the degree to which our actions and those of governments and others will directly or indirectly assist our customers counterparties and thirdparty service providers and advance our business and the economy generally is not yet clear for example while our loandeferral programs may better position customers to resume their regular payments to us in the future and enhance our brand and customer loyalty these programs may negatively impact our revenue and other results of operations at least in the near term may produce a higher degree of enrollment and other requests for extensions and rewrites than we have anticipated and may not be as successful as we expect in managing our credit risk in addition while the frbs accommodative monetary policy may benefit us to some degree by supporting economic activity among our customers this policy and sudden shifts in it may inhibit our ability to grow or sustain net interest income and effectively manage interestrate risk further while extraordinary governmental intervention in the economy and markets has created stability the scale of these actions inevitably heightens political reputational litigation and similar risks for financial intermediaries like us we are unable to estimate the nearterm and ultimate impacts of covid19 on our business and operations at this time the pandemic could cause us to experience higher credit losses in our lending portfolio additional increases in our allowance for credit losses impairment of our goodwill and other financial assets diminished access to capital markets and other funding sources further reduced demand for our products and services and other negative impacts on our financial position results of operations and prospects in addition while we continue to anticipate that our capital and liquidity positions will be sufficient sustained adverse effects may impair these positions prevent us from satisfying our minimum regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory requirements and result in downgrades in our credit ratings the covid19 pandemic and related governmental mandates and advisories also have necessitated changes in the way we and our thirdparty service providers continue operations and the length of time each of us may be required to operate under these circumstances as well as the potential for conditions to worsen or for significant disruptions to occur remains unpredictable all of these risks and uncertainties can be expected to persist at least until the pandemic is demonstrably and sustainably contained authorities cease curbing household and business activity and consumer and business confidence recover
