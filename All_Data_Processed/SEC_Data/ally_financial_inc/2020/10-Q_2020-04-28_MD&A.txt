resulted in widespread volatility and deteriorations in household business economic and market conditions including in the united states where we conduct nearly all of our business covid19 has not yet been contained and could affect significantly more households and businesses the duration and severity of the pandemic continue to be impossible to predict as is the potential for a seasonal or other resurgence after its initial containment many governmental and nongovernmental authorities have directed their actions toward curtailing household and business activity to contain covid19 while simultaneously deploying fiscal and monetarypolicy measures to partially mitigate the adverse effects on individual households and businesses these actions are not always coordinated or consistent across jurisdictions but in general have rapidly expanded in scope and intensity whether this response will be successful in mitigating the adverse effects of covid19 is unclear national regional and local economies and markets could suffer disruptions that are lasting the covid19 pandemic began to meaningfully affect the united states in march and is already negatively impacting us and our customers counterparties employees and thirdparty service providers as time goes on the adverse effects on our business financial position results of operations and prospects could be significant during the first quarter of the most notable impacts to our results of operations were a higher provision expense for credit losses and a decline in the fair value of our portfolio of equity securities our provision expense was million for the first quarter of compared to million for the first quarter of with the increase primarily driven by million of incremental reserves associated with a deterioration in macroeconomic variables such as unemployment our loss on investments during the first quarter of included million of unrealized losses as a result of changes in the fair value of our portfolio of equity securities compared to million of unrealized gains for the first quarter of primarily due to the unfavorable market conditions associated with covid19 with the spread of covid19 in the united states having only begun to accelerate in march our forecast of macroeconomic conditions and operating resultsincluding expected lifetime credit losses on our loan portfoliois subject to meaningful uncertainty evidence of nearterm negative effects and trends however has surfaced we experienced declines of approximately in our consumer automotive loan applications during the second half of march and to a slightly lesser degree this trend has continued into april as governments acted to temporarily close or restrict the operations of automotive dealers and as many consumers and businesses changed their behavior in response to governmental mandates and advisories to sharply restrain commercial and social interactions this correlates with downward pressure on the automotive sales and other operating results of our dealer customers on their capacity to accept the return of leased vehicles and on usedvehicle auction activity and values refer to the section titled automotive financing volume in this mda for a further discussion declining sales and limited operations at dealers also reduced demand in our insurance operations for consumer products such as vsc and gap protection during the second half of march and these trends and the resulting decline in written premiums have continued into april in addition many automotive manufacturers and their suppliers have taken measures to slow or shut down production during the pandemic which may negatively affect dealer inventory levels and sales in the future as well as the pace of recovery when more business and household activities resume within our corporate finance business we experienced higher draws on commercial customer lines of credit during the second half of march but this trend abated in april refinance volume and prepayment activity increased for our mortgage finance business during march and into april while purchase volume has declined as governmental stayathome orders and increased economic uncertainty took hold even amidst substantial outflows to brokerage accounts during march our deposits franchise recorded sound growth in both retail and total deposits and a strong customer retention rate of during the first quarter of and the trends into april have remained steady governments have taken unprecedented steps to partially mitigate the adverse effects of their containment measures for example in late march the cares act was enacted to inject more than trillion of financial assistance into the us economy one component of the managements discussion and analysis ally financial inc form 10q cares act is the ppp which is a billion guaranteed unsecured loan program administered by the sba loans under the ppp are fully guaranteed and may be forgiven by the sba and can be obtained by small businesses and other entities to cover payroll costs and other expenses including mortgage payments rents and utilities in april we secured funding for approximately million in loans under the ppp to our dealer customers before the initial billion appropriation was exhausted among its other provisions the cares act significantly expands eligibility for and the amount of unemployment benefits creates and funds the advance payment of a refundable tax credit for and appropriates billion to the treasury secretary to support us air carriers and other us businesses that have not otherwise received adequate economic relief as well as states and municipalities the frb has taken decisive and sweeping actions as well since march these have included a reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate to to percent a program to purchase an indeterminate amount of treasury securities and agency mortgagebacked securities and numerous facilities to support the flow of credit to households and businesses such as the primary market corporate credit facility the secondary market corporate credit facility the term assetbacked securities loan facility the money market mutual fund liquidity facility and the commercial paper funding facility we have acted swiftly as well to support our customers with industryleading programs and at the same time manage our credit risk in our automotive finance business existing customers may elect to defer their loan payments for up to days without late fees being incurred but with finance charges

this mda for our deposit customers we are waiving fees for overdrafts excessive transactions and expedited shipping of checks and debit cards for a 120day period for our brokerage customers we are waiving fees for brokerassisted trades paper statements and overnight outbound check processing for days the degree to which our actions and those of governments and others will directly or indirectly assist our customers counterparties and thirdparty service providers and advance our business and the economy generally is not yet clear for example while our loandeferral programs may better position customers to resume their regular payments to us in the future and enhance our brand and customer loyalty these programs may negatively impact our revenue and other results of operations at least in the near term in addition while the frbs accommodative monetary policy may benefit us to some degree by supporting economic activity among our customers this policy may inhibit our ability to grow or sustain net interest income in light of volatility in the capital markets and economic disruptions we continue to carefully monitor our capital and liquidity positions on march in order to support the frbs effort to mitigate the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the us economy and the financial system we announced the voluntary suspension of our stockrepurchase program for the remaining period of the first quarter and second quarter of in march the us banking agencies issued an interim final rule that became effective on march and that provides banking organizations with an alternative option to delay for two years their estimates of the impact of cecl relative to the incurred loss methodology on regulatory capital followed by a threeyear transition period as further described in note to the condensed consolidated financial statements we are electing this alternative option instead of the one described in the december rule previously issued by banking agencies during the first quarter

requirements including with common equity tier capital ratios of and respectively compared to the minimum requirement of we continue to anticipate that we will have sufficient capital levels to meet all of these requirements additionally we continue to access our routine shortterm funding sources such as fhlb borrowings and repurchase agreements and to assess longerterm funding sources such as unsecured debt and abs where credit spreads have recently increased in early april we issued million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due which provided additional parent company liquidity and further mitigated the risk of potential market volatility in future periods approximately of our funding however is through deposits and as described earlier in this section we have and currently expect to maintain a strong deposits franchise for additional discussions surrounding our capital and liquidity positions and related risks refer to the section titled liquidity management funding and regulatory capital in this mda the covid19 pandemic and related governmental mandates and advisories have necessitated changes in the way we operate our business we activated our business continuity plan in late february and since then have migrated nearly all of our workforce offsite or to workfromhome arrangements to mitigate health risks we are also carefully monitoring the activities of our vendors and other thirdparty service providers to manage the risks associated with any potential service disruptions the length of time we may be required to operate under these circumstances as well as the potential for them to worsen or for significant disruptions to occur remains uncertain while we have not yet experienced material adverse disruptions to our internal

to market risk we actively monitor the level of exposure to movements in interest rates and take actions to mitigate adverse impacts these movements may have on future earnings we use a sensitivity analysis of net financing revenue as our primary metric to measure and manage the interest rate risk of our financial instruments we prepare forwardlooking baseline forecasts of net financing revenue taking into consideration anticipated future business growth assetliability positioning and interest rates based on the implied forward curve the analysis is highly dependent upon a variety of assumptions including the repricing characteristics of retail deposits with both contractual and noncontractual maturities we continually monitor industry and competitive repricing activity along with other market factors when contemplating deposit pricing actions simulations are then used to assess changes in net financing revenue in multiple interest rate scenarios relative to the baseline forecast the changes in net financing revenue relative to the baseline are defined as the sensitivity our simulations incorporate contractual cash flows and repricing characteristics for all assets liabilities and offbalancesheet exposures and incorporate the effects of changing interest rates on the prepayment and attrition rates of certain assets and liabilities our simulation does not assume any specific future actions are taken to mitigate the impacts of changing interest rates the net financing revenue sensitivity tests measure the potential change in our pretax net financing revenue over the following months we test a number of alternative rate scenarios including immediate and gradual parallel shocks to the implied market forward curve management also evaluates nonparallel shocks to interest rates and stresses to certain term points on the yield curve in isolation to capture and monitor a number of risk types relative to our baseline forecast which is based on the implied forward curve our net financing revenue over the next months would increase by million if interest rates remain unchanged the following table presents the pretax dollar impact to forecasted

parallel shock decreases to the implied market forward curve as of march and december march december in millions gradual a instantaneous gradual a instantaneous change in interest rates basis points b basis points basis points a gradual changes in interest rates are recognized over months b the impact of the downward rate shocks is impacted by the current low interest rate environment which limits absolute declines in rates the implied forward rate curve was significantly lower across all tenors compared to december as interest rates were at or near historical lows across the curve the impact of this change is reflected in our baseline net financing revenue projections as of march our net interest income sensitivity in the and basis point instantaneous shock scenarios is positioned to benefit primarily due to changes to our derivative hedging position and the impact of lower market interest rates the exposure in the downward instantaneous interest rate shock scenario has increased as of march primarily due to the derivative hedging position referenced above as well as the impact of lower rates due to the low absolute level of market interest rates this downward shock is muted as our models assume rates do not go below zero our risk position is influenced by the impact of hedging activity which primarily consists of interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of certain fixedrate assets and fixedrate debt instruments and payfixed interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges of certain floatingrate debt instruments we also have the ability to utilize interest rate floor contracts designated as cash flow hedges on certain floatingrate assets the size maturity and mix of our hedging activities are adjusted as our balance sheet alm objectives and

primarily due to a decline in used vehicle values resulting from increased market supply the number of offlease vehicles remarketed during the three months ended march decreased compared to the same period in the decrease in remarketing volume for the three months ended march was primarily due to a temporary reduction in vehicle remarketing activity as a result of the implementation of our new technology platform for our consumer automotive loans and operating leases and subsequently impacts of the covid19 pandemic which furthered the reduction in vehicle remarketing activity during the second half of march driven by reduced activity at auction sites and low dealer demand additionally in jurisdictions where governments have acted to temporarily close or restrict the operations of automotive dealers there have also been fewer vehicles returned at lease termination these trends of reduced remarketing activity have continued into april and the persistence of this trend will

interest rate changes market volatility or changes in credit ratings when compared to other funding sources we have continued to expand our deposit gathering efforts through both direct and indirect marketing channels current retail deposit offerings consist of a variety of products including cds savings accounts moneymarket accounts ira deposit products as well as an interest checking product in

growth in retail deposits which was partially offset by a reduction in brokered deposits total retail deposits increased billion primarily within our online savings product and retail cds as we added approximately retail deposit customers during the three months ended march to more than million total retail deposit customers at march strong retention rates and customer acquisition reflecting the strength of the brand continue to drive growth in retail deposits we continue to enhance our suite of online and mobile banking features as we introduced a collection of smart savings tools to our online savings product in february for additional information on our deposit funding by type refer to note to the condensed consolidated financial statements securitizations and secured financings while we primarily fund our business through deposits we also utilize securitizations and secured funding to further diversify our funding sources securitizations and secured funding transactions collectively referred to as securitization transactions allow us to convert our automotive finance receivables and operating leases into cash earlier than what would have occurred in the normal course of business we continue to remain active in the wellestablished securitization markets additionally for consumer automotive loans and operating leases the term structure of the transaction locks in funding for a specified pool of loans and operating leases which creates an effective tool for managing interest rate and liquidity risk for additional details surrounding our securitization activities refer to the section titled liquidity management funding and regulatory capital in our annual report on form 10k during the first three months of we raised million through the completion of term securitization transactions backed by consumer automotive loans we manage securitization execution risk by maintaining a diverse domestic and foreign investor base and available capacity from committed secured credit facilities provided by banks our ability to access the unused capacity in these facilities depends on the availability of eligible assets to collateralize the incremental funding and in some instances on the execution of interest rate hedges we maintain bilateral facilities which fund our automotive finance operations the facilities can be revolving in naturegenerally having an original tenor ranging from days to two years and allowing for additional funding during the commitment periodor they can be amortizing and not allow for any further funding after the commitment period at march all of our billion of capacity was revolving and of this balance million was from facilities with a remaining tenor greater than days our securitizations of commercial automotive loans are issued through a single master trust and include creditenhancement triggers as well as earlyrepayment triggers referred to as early amortization events following an early amortization event principal collections on the loans in the applicable securitizations are applied to repay principal of the trusts assetbacked securities rather than to purchase newly originated loans one of the early amortization events is based on the rates of inventory turnover at our dealer customers referred to as payment rates because the covid19 pandemic is placing downward pressure on the automotive sales of dealers and therefore their rate of inventory turnover an increased risk exists that an early amortization event could occur in such a case our ability to issue new securitizations out of this trust would be constrained or eliminated and our ability to fund commercial automotive loans through the securitization market could be delayed while we establish a new trust in addition the mere occurrence of an early amortization event could impair our ability to access the securitization market or increase our cost to do so at this time none of these securitizations have experienced an early amortization event managements discussion and analysis ally financial inc form 10q the majority of our securitizations including our secured bilateral financing facilities involve consumer automotive loans we retain exposure to the nonperformance of these loans through subordinated retained interests in the securitizations as well as obligations to repurchase loans affected by breaches of representations warranties or covenants the secured bilateral financing facilities also include creditenhancement triggers and revolving period termination events based on the nonperformance of loans with the covid19 pandemic adversely affecting some of our consumer automotive customers and with a significant number of them having enrolled in our loandeferral program these securitizations may become more likely to experience a deterioration in loan performance and downgrades by rating agencies in addition the secured bilateral financing facilities may become more likely to experience the activation of creditenhancement triggers and revolving period termination events any of these outcomes could have negative impacts on noteholders and us including in our case a potential for higher pricing and less market access for future securitizations we also have access to funding through advances with the fhlb these advances are primarily secured by consumer mortgage finance receivables and loans and investment securities as of march we had pledged billion of assets to the fhlb resulting in billion in total funding capacity with billion of debt outstanding at march billion of our total assets were restricted as collateral for the payment of debt obligations accounted for as secured borrowings and repurchase agreements refer

program the holder has the option to require us to redeem these notes at any time without restriction demand notes outstanding were billion at march we also have shortterm and longterm unsecured debt outstanding from retail term note programs these programs are composed of callable fixedrate instruments with fixedmaturity dates and floatingrate notes there were million of retail term notes

and business strategies the cash flow analysis may not be as helpful when analyzing changes in our net earnings and net assets we believe that in addition to the traditional cash flow analysis the discussion related to liquidity dividends and alm herein may provide more useful context in evaluating our liquidity position and related activity net cash provided by operating activities was million and billion for the three months ended march and respectively activity was largely consistent yearoveryear as cash flows from our consumer and commercial lending activities remained relatively flat net cash used in investing activities was million for the three months ended march compared to billion for the same period in the decrease was primarily due to a billion increase in proceeds from sales and repayments of availableforsale securities net of purchases this was partially offset by an increase of million in net outflows from purchases and sales of equity securities and an increase of million in outflows from purchases of operating lease assets net of disposals net cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended march was billion compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million for the same period in the change was primarily attributable to an increase in net cash inflows related to shortterm borrowings of billion between the two periods this

are intended to be an indicator of the creditworthiness of a particular company security or obligation lower ratings result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets this is particularly true for certain institutional investors whose investment guidelines require investmentgrade ratings on term debt and the two highest rating categories for shortterm debt particularly

agency maintaining its respective outlook on april dbrs changed their longterm outlook to negative from positive given the current operating environment and adverse impacts related to covid19 we expect other rating agencies may also potentially reassess their outlooks or ratings rating agencies indicate that they base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors which may include capital adequacy liquidity asset quality business mix level and quality of earnings and the current operating legislative and regulatory environment rating agencies themselves could make or be required to make substantial changes to their ratings policies and practicesparticularly in response to legislative and regulatory changes potential changes in rating methodology as well as in the legislative and regulatory environment and the timing of those changes could impact our ratings which as noted above could increase our borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and the ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating managements discussion and analysis ally financial inc form 10q offbalancesheet arrangements refer to note to the condensed consolidated financial statements critical accounting estimates we identified critical accounting estimates that as a result of judgments uncertainties uniqueness and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved could result in material changes to our financial condition results of operations or cash flows under different conditions or using different assumptions our most critical accounting estimates are as follows allowance for loan losses valuation of automotive lease assets and residuals fair value of financial instruments determination of provision for income taxes on january we adopted asu financial instruments credit losses this guidance replaced the incurred loss methodology which was used to calculate the allowance for loan losses as described in the consolidated financial statements in our annual report on form 10k with an expected lifetime loss methodology as described in the allowance for loan losses section below during we did not substantively change any material aspect of our overall methodologies and processes used in developing the remaining critical accounting estimates from what was described in the consolidated financial statements in our annual report on form 10k refer to note to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding the methodology used in calculating the provision for income taxes for interim financial reporting allowance for loan losses we maintain an allowance for loan losses the allowance to reflect the net amount expected to be collected from our lending portfolios the allowance is maintained at a level that management considers to be adequate based upon ongoing quarterly assessments and evaluations using relevant available information which includes both internal and external sources relating to past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions additions and reductions to the allowance are charged to current period earnings through the provision for credit losses amounts determined to be uncollectible are charged directly against the allowance net of amounts recovered on previously chargedoff accounts expected recoveries do not exceed the total of amounts chargedoff or expected to be chargedoff the allowance is measured using statistical models that are designed to correlate certain macroeconomic variables to expected future credit losses the macroeconomic data used in the models are based on forecasted variables for the next months beyond this forecast period we revert to an historical average for each of the variables on a straightline basis over months the allowance reflects managements estimate of expected credit losses over the contractual term of our lending portfolio and involves significant judgment which could materially affect the provision for credit losses and therefore net income for additional information regarding our portfolio segments and classes refer to note to the condensed consolidated financial statements the consumer portfolio segments consist of smallerbalance homogeneous loans within our automotive finance operations mortgage finance operations and consumer unsecured lending operations which is included within corporate and other the allowance model for each consumer portfolio segment is calculated using proprietary statistical models and other risk indicators applied to pools of loans that share similar risk characteristics loans that do not share similar risk characteristics are evaluated individually for additional information regarding the allowance calculation for the consumer portfolio segments refer to note to the condensed consolidated financial statements the commercial portfolio segment is primarily composed of largerbalance nonhomogeneous exposures within our automotive finance operations and corporate finance operations these loans generally do not have similar risk characteristics and as a result are primarily evaluated individually management establishes specific allowances for commercial loans based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate or the observable market price or the fair value of collateral whichever is determined to be the most appropriate estimated costs to sell the collateral on an undiscounted basis are included in the impairment measurement when appropriate loans that share similar risk characteristics are pooled and evaluated collectively for additional information regarding the allowance calculation for the commercial portfolio segment refer to note of the condensed consolidated financial statements the determination of the allowance is influenced by numerous assumptions and many factors that may materially affect estimates of loss including changes in lgd pd and rating migration the critical assumptions underlying the allowance include i segmentation of each portfolio based on common risk characteristics ii the development of reasonable and supportable forecasts of future macroeconomic conditions and iii evaluation by management of borrower collateral and geographic information management monitors the adequacy of the allowance and makes adjustments as the assumptions in the underlying analyses change to reflect an estimate of expected lifetime loan losses at the reporting date based on the best information available at that time
