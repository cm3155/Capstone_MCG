revenue sensitivity analysis interest rate risk represents one of our most significant exposures to market risk we actively monitor the level of exposure to movements in interest rates and take actions to mitigate adverse impacts these movements may have on future earnings we use a sensitivity analysis of net financing revenue as our primary metric to measure and manage the interest rate risk of our financial instruments we prepare forwardlooking baseline forecasts of net financing revenue taking into consideration anticipated future business growth assetliability positioning and interest rates based on the implied forward curve the analysis is highly dependent upon a variety of assumptions including the repricing characteristics of retail deposits with both contractual and noncontractual maturities we continually monitor industry and competitive repricing activity along with other market factors when contemplating deposit pricing assumptions simulations are then used to assess changes in net financing revenue in multiple interest rate scenarios relative to the baseline forecast the changes in net financing revenue relative to the baseline are defined as the sensitivity our simulations incorporate contractual cash flows and repricing characteristics for all assets liabilities and offbalance sheet exposures and incorporate the effects of changing interest rates on the prepayment and attrition rates of certain assets and liabilities our simulation does not assume any specific future actions are taken to mitigate the impacts of changing interest rates the net financing revenue sensitivity tests measure the potential change in our pretax net financing revenue over the following months we test a number of alternative rate scenarios including immediate and gradual parallel shocks to the implied market forward curve management also evaluates nonparallel shocks to interest rates and stresses to certain term points on the yield curve in

december and december table start december december gradual a instantaneous gradual a instantaneous change in interest rates in millions in millions basis points basis points basis points b table end a gradual changes in interest rates are recognized over months b our models currently assume rates do not go below zero the implied forward rate curve was steeper at december as interest rates were at or near historical lows across the curve on december the impact of this change is reflected in our baseline net financing revenue projections as of december we managements discussion and analysis ally financial inc form 10k expect upward interest rate shock scenarios to have a modest impact to the baseline forecast as the repricing of our asset base combined with the benefit of our pay fixed swap position is expected to largely offset assumed repricing of our liabilities primarily deposits the exposure in the downward interest rate shock scenarios is largely driven by floatingrate assets and prepayment risk largely offset by assumed repricing of liquid deposits our risk position is influenced by the impact of hedging activity which primarily consists of interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of certain fixedrate assets and fixedrate debt instruments and payfixed interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges of certain floatingrate debt instruments the size maturity and mix of our hedging activities are adjusted as our balance sheet alm objectives and interest rate environment evolve over time operating lease residual risk management we are exposed to residual risk on vehicles in the consumer operating lease portfolio this operating lease residual risk represents the possibility that the actual proceeds realized upon the sale of returned vehicles will be

indicators production cycle automotive manufacturer incentives and unanticipated shifts in used vehicle supply as well as expert judgment this internally generated data is compared against thirdparty independent data for reasonableness periodically we revise the projected value of the leased vehicle at termination based on current market conditions and adjust depreciation expense over the

on remarketing recorded through depreciation expense remarketing abilities our ability to efficiently process and effectively market offlease vehicles affects the disposal costs and the proceeds realized from vehicle sales vehicles can be remarketed through auction internet and physical sale to dealer sale to lessee and other methods the results within these channels vary with physical auction typically resulting in the lowestpriced outcome manufacturer vehicle and marketing programs automotive manufacturers influence operating lease residual results in the following ways the brand image of automotive manufacturers and consumer demand for their products affects residual risk the discontinuation of or stylistic changes to a certain make or model may affect the value of existing vehicles automotive manufacturer marketing programs may influence the used vehicle market for those vehicles through programs such as incentives on new vehicles programs designed to encourage lessees

primarily due to impacts of the covid19 pandemic which reduced vehicle remarketing activity at auction sites and lowered dealer demand in the first two quarters of as well as increases in demand for used vehicles in recent periods the remarketing channel mix for dealer and lessee buyouts increased during the year ended december primarily due to supply constraints increasing dealer demand for offlease vehicles as well as increases in new vehicle prices that are causing a shift in consumer preference the shift in offlease vehicle disposition mix is expected to continue in the near term and

disclosed summary results of its second round of supervisory stress testing and extended its deadline for notifying firms about whether their stress capital buffer requirements will be recalculated to march on march the frb further extended this deadline to june on june we received notification from the frb that our stress capital buffer requirement would not be recalculated in connection with the second round of supervisory stress testing in june the frb announced several actions to ensure that large firms such as ally would remain resilient despite the economic uncertainty from the covid19 pandemic including for the third quarter of the suspension of repurchases by any firm of its common stock except repurchases relating to issuances of common stock related to employee stock ownership plans and the disallowance of any increase by a firm in the amount of its commonstock dividends and the imposition of a commonstock dividend limit equal to the average of the firms net income for the four preceding calendar quarters these restrictions were extended by the frb for the fourth quarter of in december the frb extended and modified these restrictions for the first quarter of to limit aggregate commonstock dividends and share repurchases to an amount equal to the average of the firms net income for the four preceding calendar quarters subject to specified exceptions on march the frb extended these modified restrictions for the second quarter of and announced that for a firm such as ally that is not subject to the supervisory stress test and on a twoyear cycle the additional restrictions will end after june and the firms stress capital buffer requirement based on the june supervisory stress test results will remain in place on january our board authorized a stockrepurchase program permitting us to repurchase up to billion of our common stock from time to time from the first quarter of through the fourth quarter of subject to restrictions imposed by the frb on july our board authorized an increase in the maximum amount of this stockrepurchase program from billion to billion on january our board authorized a stockrepurchase program permitting us to repurchase up to billion of our common stock from time to time from the first quarter of through the fourth quarter of and an increase in our cash dividend on common stock from per share for the fourth quarter of to per share for the first quarter of in january the frb issued a final rule effective april to align its capital planning and stress capital buffer requirements with the tailoring framework under the final rule unless otherwise directed by the frb in specified circumstances ally and other category iv firms are generally no longer required to calculate forwardlooking projections of revenues losses reserves and pro forma capital levels under scenarios provided by the frb each firm continues to be required however to provide a forwardlooking analysis of income and capital levels under expected and stressful conditions that are designed by the firm in addition for category iv firms the final rule updated the frequency of calculating the portion of the stress capital buffer derived from the supervisory stress test to every other year these firms have the ability to elect to participate in the supervisory stress testand receive a correspondingly updated stress capital buffer requirementin a year in which they would not generally be subject to the supervisory stress test during a year in which a category iv firm does not undergo a supervisory stress test the firm would receive an updated stress capital buffer requirement that reflects its updated planned commonstock dividends the final rule also includes reporting and other changes consistent with the tailoring framework ally did not opt into the supervisory stress test but will be subject to the supervisory stress test with submissions due by april we submitted our capital plan on april which includes planned capital distributions to common stockholders through share repurchases and cash dividends over the ninequarter planning horizon and other capital actions during the second quarter of we issued billion of series b preferred stock and billion of series c preferred stock both of which qualify as additional tier capital under us basel iii the proceeds from these issuances were used to redeem a portion of the series trups then outstanding refer to note and note to the consolidated financial statements for additional details about these instruments and capital actions in june we submitted an updated capital plan to the frb reflecting these capital actions and the increases in our stockrepurchase program and commonstock dividend described above this updated capital plan was used by the frb to recalculate allys final stress capital buffer requirement which was announced in august and remained unchanged at our ability to make capital distributions including our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock will continue to be subject to the frbs review and our internal governance requirements including approval by our board the amount and size of any future dividends and share repurchases also will be subject to various factors including allys capital and liquidity positions accounting and regulatory considerations including any restrictions

rating agencies indicate that they base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors which may include capital adequacy liquidity asset quality business mix level and quality of earnings and the current operating legislative and regulatory environment rating agencies themselves could make or be required to make substantial changes to their ratings policies and practicesparticularly in response to legislative and regulatory changes potential changes in rating methodology as well as in the legislative and regulatory environment and the timing of those changes could impact our ratings

integral to understanding our managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make certain judgments and assumptions on the basis of information available at the time of the financial statements in determining accounting estimates used in the preparation of these statements our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements certain of our critical accounting policies requiring significant management assumptions and judgment are described in this section an accounting estimate is considered critical if the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made if actual results differ from our judgments and assumptions then it may have an adverse impact on the results of operations and cash flows our management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to these estimates allowance for loan losses we maintain an allowance for loan losses the allowance to reflect the net amount expected to be collected from our lending portfolios the allowance is maintained at a level that management considers to be adequate based upon ongoing quarterly assessments and evaluations using relevant available information which includes both internal and external sources relating to past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions additions and reductions to the allowance are charged to current period earnings through the provision for credit losses amounts determined to be uncollectible are charged directly against the allowance net of amounts recovered on previously chargedoff accounts expected recoveries do not exceed the total of amounts chargedoff or expected to be chargedoff the allowance is measured using statisticallyestimated models that are designed to correlate customer and collateral quality as well as certain macroeconomic variables to expected future credit losses the macroeconomic data used in the models is based on forecasted variables for the next months beyond this forecast period we revert to a historical average for each of the variables on a straightline basis over months our baseline macroeconomic forecast is consistent with the 50th percentile in a distribution of possible economic outcomes the consumer portfolio segments consist of loans that generally share similar risk characteristics within our automotive finance operations mortgage finance operations and our personal lending and credit card operations both of which are included within corporate and other the allowance model for each consumer portfolio segment is calculated using either internal or thirdparty proprietary statistical models and other risk indicators applied to pools of loans that share similar risk characteristics loans that do not share similar risk managements discussion and analysis ally financial inc form 10k characteristics are evaluated individually for additional information regarding the allowance calculation for the consumer portfolio segments refer to note to the consolidated financial statements the commercial portfolio segment is composed of loans that may or may not share similar risk characteristics within our automotive finance operations and corporate finance operations loans that have similar risk characteristics are pooled and evaluated collectively for loan losses using proprietary risk rating models loans that do not share similar risk characteristics are evaluated individually credit losses for loans evaluated individually within this segment are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate or the observable market price or the fair value of collateral whichever is determined to be the most appropriate estimated costs to sell the collateral on an undiscounted basis are included in the measurement if we intend to sell the underlying collateral as opposed to operating it for additional information regarding the allowance calculation for the commercial portfolio segment refer to note to the consolidated financial statements the determination of the allowance is influenced by numerous assumptions and factors that may materially affect estimates of loss the critical assumptions underlying the allowance include i segmentation of each portfolio based on common risk characteristics ii the development of reasonable and supportable forecasts of future macroeconomic conditions and iii evaluation by management of borrower collateral and geographic information management monitors the adequacy of the allowance and makes adjustments as the assumptions in the underlying analyses change to reflect an estimate of expected lifetime loan losses at the reporting date based on the best information available at that time the allowance reflects managements estimate of expected credit losses over the contractual term of our lending portfolio and involves significant judgment which could materially affect the provision for credit losses and therefore net income for additional information regarding our portfolio segments and classes allowance for loan losses and other credit quality indicators refer to note to the consolidated financial statements macroeconomic sensitivity analysis we perform a sensitivity analysis using scenarios derived from widely published macroeconomic forecasts to quantify the sensitivity of our baseline forecast to both favorable and unfavorable changes in macroeconomic conditions these scenarios are based on fixed probabilities of occurrence the favorable or upside scenario is consistent with the 10th percentile in a distribution of possible economic outcomes and implies that there is a chance that the realized economy will be better than the defined path and a chance that the realized economy will be worse than the defined path the unfavorable or downside scenario is consistent with the 90th percentile in a distribution of possible economic outcomes and implies that there is a chance that the realized economy will be better than the defined path and a chance that the realized economy will be worse than the defined path as of december results of this sensitivity analysis indicate that the favorable scenario would reduce our allowance for loan losses by and the unfavorable scenario would increase our allowance for loan losses by these results are estimates that are directly tied to the timing severity and duration of changes in the independently and instantaneously shocked macroeconomic scenario actual loss sensitivities and resulting estimates of consolidated allowance for loan losses may be influenced by numerous other factors including but not limited to the actual evaluation of macroeconomic conditions future government and management actions and other quantitative and qualitative information and adjustments therefore this sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and is not intended to represent our expectation of changes in our estimate of expected credit losses due to a change in the macroeconomic environment valuation of automotive operating lease assets and residuals we have significant investments in vehicles in our operating lease portfolio in accounting for operating leases management must make a determination at the beginning of the operating lease contract of the estimated realizable value ie residual value of the vehicle at the end of the lease residual value represents an estimate of the market value of the vehicle at the end of the lease term at contract inception we determine pricing based on the projected residual value of the vehicle this evaluation is primarily based on a proprietary model which includes variables such as age of the vehicle expected mileage seasonality segment factors vehicle type economic indicators production cycle automotive manufacturer incentives and shifts in used vehicle supply this internally generated data is compared against thirdparty independent data for reasonableness the customer is obligated to make payments during the term of the lease for the difference between the purchase price and the contract residual value plus rental charges however since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract we are exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the value of the vehicle is below the residual value estimated at contract inception to account for residual risk we depreciate automotive operating lease assets to expected realizable value on a straightline basis over the lease term the estimated realizable value is initially based on the expected residual value established at contract inception periodically we review the projected value of the leased vehicle at termination based on current market conditions and other relevant data points and adjust depreciation expense as necessary over the remaining term of the lease management periodically performs a detailed review of the estimated realizable value of vehicles to assess the appropriateness of the carrying value of operating lease assets impairment of operating lease assets is assessed upon the occurrence of a triggering event triggering events are systemic observed events impacting the used vehicle market such as shocks to oil and gas prices that may indicate impairment of the operating lease asset impairment is determined to exist if the expected managements discussion and analysis ally financial inc form 10k undiscounted cash flows generated from the operating lease assets are less than the carrying value of the operating lease assets if the operating lease assets are impaired they are written down to their fair value as estimated by discounted cash flows there were no such impairment charges in or our depreciation methodology for operating lease assets considers managements expectation of the value of the vehicles upon lease termination which is based on numerous assumptions and factors influencing used vehicle values the critical assumptions underlying the estimated carrying value of automotive operating lease assets include i estimated market value information obtained and used by management in estimating residual values ii proper identification and estimation of business conditions iii our remarketing abilities and iv automotive manufacturer vehicle and marketing programs changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the operating lease residual value expected residual values include estimates of payments from automotive manufacturers related to residual support and risksharing agreements if any to the extent an automotive manufacturer is not able to fully honor its obligation relative to these agreements our depreciation expense would be negatively impacted fair value of financial instruments we use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain instruments and to determine fair value disclosures refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of valuation methodologies used to measure material assets and liabilities at fair value and details of the valuation models key inputs to those models and significant assumptions utilized we follow the fair value hierarchy set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements in order to prioritize the inputs utilized to measure fair value we review and modify as necessary our fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis which can result in reclassifications between hierarchy levels we have numerous internal controls in place to address risks inherent in estimating fair value measurements significant fair value measurements are subject to detailed analytics and management review and approval we have an established risk management policy and model validation program this model validation program establishes a controlled environment for the development implementation and operation of models used to generate fair value measurements and change procedures further this program uses a riskbased approach to determine the frequency at which models are to be independently reviewed and validated additionally a wide array of operational controls governs fair value measurements including controls over the inputs into and the outputs from the fair value measurement models for example we backtest the internal assumptions used within models against actual performance we also monitor the market for recent trades market surveys or other market information that may be used to benchmark model inputs or outputs certain valuations will also be benchmarked to market indices when appropriate and available we have scheduled model or input recalibrations that occur on a periodic basis but will recalibrate earlier if significant variances are observed as part of the backtesting or benchmarking noted above considerable judgment is used in forming conclusions from market observable data used to estimate our level fair value measurements and in estimating inputs to our internal valuation models used to estimate our level fair value measurements level inputs such as interest rate movements prepayment speeds credit losses and discount rates are inherently difficult to estimate changes to these inputs can have a significant effect on fair value measurements and amounts that could be realized refer to the section titled fair value sensitivity analysis within this mda for a sensitivity analysis of changes in interest rates foreigncurrency exchange rates and equity prices determination of provision for income taxes our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect managements best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes predominantly in the united states we file income tax returns in approximately jurisdictions federal state and local the laws and regulations of each jurisdiction are complex and may be subject to different interpretations significant judgments and estimates are required in determining consolidated income tax expense for each jurisdiction our interpretations of tax laws are subject to audits by various jurisdictions potential difference in the interpretation or changes in the tax laws may result in additional accrual of income tax expense or benefit which could be material to our reported results we consistently monitor new and reassess existing tax laws for changes and adjust our tax estimates accordingly our provision for income taxes is comprised of current and deferred income taxes deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent results of operations in projecting future taxable income we begin with historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state federal and foreign pretax operating income these assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide we consider three years of cumulative operating income loss as of each reporting date we consider existing evidence both positive and negative that could impact our view with regard to future realization of deferred tax assets we currently hold deferred tax asset attributes related to net operating tax loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards we perform regular assessments to determine whether our tax attributes are realizable as of december we continue to believe it is more likely than not that the benefit for certain foreign tax credit carryforwards and state net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized in recognition of this risk we continue to provide a partial valuation allowance on these deferred tax assets relating to these carryforwards and it is reasonably possible that the valuation allowance may change in the next months managements discussion and analysis ally financial inc form 10k for additional information regarding our provision for
