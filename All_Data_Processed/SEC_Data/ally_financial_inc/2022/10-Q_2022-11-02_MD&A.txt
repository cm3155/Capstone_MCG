amortized cost to be determined based on the total current expected credit losses over the life of the financial asset or group of assets under cecl our modeling processes incorporate the following macroeconomic considerations a single forecast scenario for macroeconomic factors incorporated into the modeling process a 12month reasonable and supportable forecast period for macroeconomic factors

financial inc form 10q we prepare forwardlooking baseline forecasts of net financing revenue taking into consideration anticipated future business growth assetliability positioning and interest rates based on the implied forward curve the analysis is highly dependent upon a variety of assumptions including the repricing characteristics of retail deposits with both contractual and noncontractual maturities we continually monitor industry and competitive repricing activity along with other market factors when contemplating deposit pricing assumptions simulations are then used to assess changes in net financing revenue in multiple interest rate scenarios relative to the baseline forecast the changes in net financing revenue relative to the baseline are defined as the sensitivity our simulations incorporate contractual cash flows and repricing characteristics for all assets liabilities and offbalance sheet exposures and incorporate the effects of changing interest rates on the prepayment and attrition rates of certain assets and liabilities our simulation does not assume any specific future actions are taken to mitigate the impacts of changing interest rates the net financing revenue simulations measure the potential change in our pretax net financing revenue over the following months we test a number of alternative rate scenarios including immediate and gradual parallel shocks to the implied market forward curve management also evaluates nonparallel shocks to interest rates and stresses to certain term points on the yield curve in isolation to capture and monitor a number of risk types relative to our baseline forecast our net financing revenue over the next months is expected to increase by million if interest rates remain unchanged due to expected increases in the federal funds rate resulting in an inversion of the yield curve the following table presents the pretax dollar impact to baseline forecasted net financing revenue over the next months

millions basis points basis points basis points b nm nm nm not meaningful a gradual changes in interest rates are recognized over months b our models currently assume rates do not go below zero since december the implied forward rate curve has increased flattened and inverted as market expectations for shortterm interest rates have increased more than longterm rates the impact of this change is reflected in our baseline net financing revenue projections as of september we remain liability sensitive to a parallel move in interest rates as the assumed repricing of our assets and payfixed swap position is more than offset by assumed repricing of our liabilities our exposure to the downward interest rate shock scenario as of december is not provided as many interest rates were at or near historical lows limiting our models ability to reprice lower our risk position is influenced by the impact of hedging activity which primarily consists of interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of certain fixedrate assets and fixedrate debt instruments and payfixed interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges of certain floatingrate debt instruments we also have the ability to use interest rate floor contracts designated as cash flow hedges on certain floatingrate assets the size maturity and mix of our hedging activities are adjusted as our balance sheet alm objectives and interest rate environment evolve over time operating lease residual risk management we are exposed to residual risk on vehicles in the consumer operating lease portfolio this operating lease residual
