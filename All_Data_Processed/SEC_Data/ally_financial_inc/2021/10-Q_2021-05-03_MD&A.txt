as interest rates credit spreads foreignexchange rates equity prices and offlease vehicle prices the impact of changes in benchmark interest rates on our assets and liabilities interest rate risk represents an exposure to market risk and can affect interest rate sensitivities and cash flows when compared to our expectations we primarily use interest rate derivatives to manage our interest rate risk exposure the fair value of our creditsensitive assets is also exposed to credit spread risk credit spread is the amount of additional return over the benchmark interest rates that an investor would demand for taking exposure to the credit risk of an instrument generally an increase in credit spreads would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement we are also exposed to foreigncurrency risk arising from foreigncurrency denominated assets and liabilities primarily in canada we enter into hedges to mitigate foreign exchange risk we also have exposure to changes in the value of equity securities we have exposure to equity securities with readily determinable fair values primarily related to our insurance operations for such equity securities we use equity derivatives to manage our exposure to equity price fluctuations in addition we are exposed to changes in the value of other equity investments without readily determinable fair market values refer to note to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information we may experience changes in the valuation of these investments which may cause volatility in our earnings the composition of our balance sheet including shorterduration consumer automotive loans and variablerate commercial loans coupled with the continued funding shift toward retail deposits partially

mortgage loans using sofr through our directtoconsumer channel which are held for sale net financing revenue sensitivity analysis interest rate risk represents one of our most significant exposures to market risk we actively monitor the level of exposure to movements in interest rates and take actions to mitigate adverse impacts these movements may have on future earnings we use a sensitivity analysis of net financing revenue as our primary metric to measure and manage the interest rate risk of our financial instruments we prepare forwardlooking baseline forecasts of net financing revenue taking into consideration anticipated future business growth assetliability positioning and interest rates based on the implied forward curve the analysis is highly dependent upon a variety of assumptions including the repricing characteristics of retail deposits with both contractual and noncontractual maturities we continually monitor industry and competitive repricing activity along with other market factors when contemplating deposit pricing assumptions simulations are then used to assess changes in net financing revenue in multiple interest rate scenarios relative to the baseline forecast the changes in net financing revenue relative to the baseline are defined as the sensitivity our simulations incorporate contractual cash flows and repricing characteristics for all assets liabilities and offbalance sheet exposures and incorporate the effects of changing interest rates on the prepayment and attrition rates of certain assets and liabilities our simulation does not assume any specific future actions are taken to mitigate the impacts of changing interest rates the net financing revenue sensitivity tests measure the potential change in our pretax net financing revenue over the following months we test a number of alternative rate scenarios including immediate and gradual parallel shocks to the implied market forward curve management also evaluates nonparallel shocks to interest rates and stresses to certain term points on the yield curve in isolation to capture and monitor a number of risk types relative to our baseline forecast our net financing revenue over the next months is expected to decrease by million if interest rates remain unchanged the following table presents the pretax dollar impact to baseline forecasted net financing revenue over the next months assuming various shocks to the implied market forward curve as of march and december march december gradual a instantaneous gradual a instantaneous change in interest rates in millions in millions march basis points basis points basis points b a gradual changes in interest rates are recognized over months b our models currently assume rates do not go below zero the implied forward rate curve was steeper compared to december as interest rates were at or near historical lows across the curve the impact of this change is reflected in our baseline net financing revenue projections as of march we expect an upward instantaneous interest rate shock scenario to have a modest negative impact to the baseline forecast primarily due to a shift from floatingrate to fixedrate assets our continued shift in funding to retail deposits and changes to our derivative hedging position the exposure in the downward instantaneous interest rate shock scenario is largely driven by floatingrate assets and prepayment risk as well as limited repricing of liquid deposits our risk position is influenced by the impact of hedging activity which primarily consists of interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of certain fixedrate assets and fixedrate debt instruments and payfixed interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges of certain floatingrate debt instruments we also have the ability to utilize interest rate floor contracts designated as cash flow hedges on certain floatingrate assets the size maturity and mix of our hedging activities are adjusted as our balance sheet

performance were primarily due to continued new vehicle supply constraints coupled with increased demand the number of offlease vehicles remarketed during the three months ended march increased compared to the same period in this increase is primarily due to lower remarketing activity in the first quarter of as a result of the implementation of our new technology platform for our consumer automotive loans and operating leases and subsequently impacts of the covid19 pandemic which furthered the reduction in vehicle remarketing activity during the second half of march we expect positive trends in remarketing performance to continue in the near term and as a result have adjusted the rate of depreciation expense to recognize lower lifetime depreciation on vehicles scheduled to
