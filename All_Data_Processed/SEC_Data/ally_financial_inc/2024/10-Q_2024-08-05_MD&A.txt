failures net financing revenue sensitivity analysis interest rate risk represents one of our most significant exposures to market risk we actively monitor the level of exposure to movements in interest rates and take actions to mitigate adverse impacts these movements may have on future earnings we use a sensitivity analysis of net financing revenue as our primary metric to measure and manage the interest rate risk of our financial instruments interest rate risk metrics are reported at each regularly scheduled meeting of the alco and of the rc reporting includes exposure relative to risk limits impacts to a range of rate scenarios and sensitivity tests of key assumptions the execution of our current business strategy generally results in shorterduration fixedrate consumer automotive loans comprising the majority of our assets and liquid floatingrate retail deposits comprising the majority of our liabilities this in turn results in a structurally liability sensitive balance sheet as our floatingrate retail deposits reprice faster than our fixedrate consumer automotive loans when interest rates change we prepare forwardlooking baseline forecasts of pretax net financing revenue as well as anticipated future business growth actions to alter our assetliability positioning and interest rates based on the implied forward curve the analysis is highly dependent upon a variety of assumptions one of the most significant being the repricing characteristics of retail deposits with both contractual and noncontractual maturities we monitor industry and competitive repricing activity along with other business and market factors when developing deposit pricing assumptions modeled simulations are then used to assess changes in pretax net financing revenue in multiple interest rate scenarios relative to the baseline forecast the changes in net financing revenue relative to the baseline are defined as the sensitivity our simulations incorporate contractual cash flows and assumed repricing characteristics for assets liabilities and offbalance sheet exposures and incorporate the assumed effects of changing interest rates on the prepayment and attrition rates of certain assets and liabilities our simulations do not assume any specific future actions are taken to mitigate the impacts of changing interest rates these simulations measure the potential changes in our pretax net financing revenue over the following months we test a number of alternative rate scenarios including immediate and gradual parallel shocks to the implied forward curve we also evaluate nonparallel shocks to interest rates and stresses to certain term points on the yield curve in isolation to capture and monitor a variety of risks simulation results are driven by underlying models and assumptions that are based on trend behavior and other historical information the underlying models and assumptions including retail deposit pricing are regularly monitored and evaluated and may be updated accordingly as observed trends materialize as a result if future trends or behaviors deviate from those reflected in the models actual sensitivities may varyperhaps significantlyfrom those that are modeled for example the pace and magnitude of changes in the federalfunds rate during the last two years has challenged models like ours whose historical data is largely derived from a more stable rate environment during the first quarter of we updated our liquid deposit repricing assumptions generally increasing the liability sensitivity of our balance sheet actual sensitivities may differ for other reasons as well including unplanned changes in balance sheet composition timing of asset and liability repricing the yield curve customer behavior macroeconomic conditions the competitive environment and management strategies accordingly we do not treat the sensitivities as forecasts of net financing revenue but instead use them as a tool in managing interest rate risk we also assess allys sensitivity to interest rate risk through the performance of sensitivity testing of key assumptions including but not limited to prepayments and retail automotive and deposit repricing on a routine basis managements discussion and analysis ally financial inc form 10q in a stable rate scenario that assumes spot rates as of june remain constant through

december the implied forward curve has increased and remained higher for a longer period during the first half of our floatingrate commercial balances and cash balances increased while our fixedrate asset balances decreased primarily due to closing the sale of ally lending and the continued runoff of our investment securities and residential mortgage portfolios respectively additionally we saw a shift from cds to liquid deposits the impact of these changes is reflected in our baseline net financing revenue forecast as of june our balance sheets modest liability sensitivity is driven by the assumed repricing of our deposits and higher levels of marketbased funding outpacing the assumed repricing of our floatingrate assets and payfixed swaps our interest rate risk position is influenced by the impact of hedging activity which primarily consists of interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of certain fixedrate assets and fixedrate debt instruments additionally we use interest rate floor contracts designated as cash flow hedges on certain floatingrate assets the size maturity and mix of our hedging activities are adjusted as our balance sheet alm objectives and the interest rate environment evolve over time our hedging strategies however are not designed to eliminate all interest rate risk and we were adversely affected from high interest rates in and operating

fhlb managing securities collateral pledged to the fhlb maintaining competitive retail deposit pricing managing new loan origination volumes and increasing available frb discount window capacity by pledging additional consumer automotive loan collateral in march we also became eligible for the frb standing repo facility which allows banks to borrow overnight cash from the frb through a repurchase agreement using us treasury or agency mortgagebacked securities as collateral we had billion of total available liquidity as of june which included billion of available fhlb capacity and billion of available frb discount window capacity refer to the section above titled liquidity risk management fhlb funding provides us with a stable funding source and can be drawn upon on a sameday basis if sufficiently secured with available collateral in support of american businesses and households the frb created the btfp in march to make additional funding available to eligible depository institutions in order to help assure that banks have the ability to meet the needs of all of their depositors the frb ceased making new loans as scheduled on march we did not borrow from the btfp through the duration of the eligibility period as of june we had billion in total available funding capacity through the frb discount window with no debt outstanding during the six months ended june following the failures of svb and signature on may first republic bank was closed by the california department of financial protection and innovation which appointed the fdic as receiver the fdic entered into a purchase and assumption agreement with jpmorgan chase bank to assume all the deposits and substantially all the assets of first republic bank we continue to monitor and assess the impact of these failures on category iv firms like ally managements discussion and analysis ally financial inc form 10q in april in a statement accompanying the review of the frbs supervision and regulation of svb frb vice chair for supervision barr highlighted a plan to revisit the tailoring rules and develop stronger capital liquidity stresstesting and other standards for category iv firms like ally in july the us banking agencies issued a proposed rule to customize and implement revisions to the global basel iii capital framework that were approved by the basel committee in december commonly known as the basel iii endgame or as basel iv for regulatory capital the proposed rule would eliminate the effect of the tailoring rules by requiring the recognition of most elements of accumulated other comprehensive income and loss and the application of deductions limitations and criteria for specified capital investments minority interests and tlac holdings for each of the riskbased capital ratios a large banking organization like ally would calculate and be bound by the lower of two alternatives one version of the ratio based on an expanded riskbased approach prescribed in the proposed rule and one version of the ratio based on the standardized approach as modified by the proposed rule all capital buffer requirements including the stress capital buffer requirement would apply regardless of whether the expanded riskbased approach or the standardized approach produces the lower ratio under the expanded riskbased approach total rwas would equal the sum of the rwas for credit risk equity risk operational risk market risk and cva risk as set forth in the proposed rule minus any amount of the banking organizations adjusted allowance for credit losses that is not included in tier capital and any amount of allocated transfer risk reserves under the standardized approach total rwas would be calculated using the existing rules with a revised methodology for determining rwas for market risk and a required application of the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk for derivative exposures category iv firms would be further required under the proposed rule to project their riskbased capital ratios under baseline conditions in their capital plans and related reports using the rwacalculation approach that results in their binding riskbased capital ratios as of the start of the projection horizon the proposed rule also would roll back additional elements of the tailoring rules by applying to category iv firms the supplementary leverage ratio the countercyclical capital buffer and enhanced public disclosure and reporting requirements under the proposed rule a threeyear transition period from july to june would apply to the recognition of accumulated other comprehensive income and loss in regulatory capital and the use of the expanded riskbased approach the phasein of accumulated other comprehensive income and loss is expected to significantly affect our levels of regulatory capital while we believe that this would be manageable we also anticipate that our levels of regulatory capital would need to be gradually increased in advance of and during the proposed transition period as for the proposed changes to rwas while we continue to evaluate the effects of individual provisions and the interplay among them as well as potential management actions in response the impact is not currently expected to be significant in the aggregate if the proposed rule were adopted in its existing form since the proposed rule was issued we have been engaged with research and advocacy groups to inform the rulemaking process and better understand the impacts of the proposed rule on banking organizations of various sizes and complexitiesas well as the competitive environment more broadlyand likewise encourage the us banking agencies to closely study these impacts and their wider implications in august the us banking agencies issued a proposed rule to improve the resolvability of category iv firms like ally the proposed rule would require category ii iii and iv firms their large consolidated banks and other institutions to issue and maintain minimum amounts of eligible longterm debt in an amount that is the greater of i percent of total rwas ii percent of average total consolidated assets and iii percent of total leverage exposure cidis like ally bank that are consolidated subsidiaries of covered entities like ally would be required to issue eligible longterm debt internally to a company that consolidates the cidi which would in turn be required to purchase that longterm debt only longterm debt instruments that are most readily able to absorb losses in a resolution proceeding would qualify and the operations of covered entities would be subject to cleanholdingcompany requirements such as prohibitions and limitations on their liabilities to unaffiliated entities under the proposed rule a transition period would apply with and percent of the longtermdebt requirements coming into effect by the end of the first second and third years respectively after finalization of the rule we are still assessing the impact of this proposed rule but due to the current structure and amount of debt instruments issued by ally and ally bank we expect it to significantly affect us whether and when final rules related to these proposals may be adopted and take effect as well as what changes to the proposed rules may be reflected in any final rules after public comments are considered remain unclear also beyond these proposed rules more stringent and less tailored liquidity stresstesting and other standards for category iv firms like ally may be forthcoming including those that may reinstate the lcr require more rigorous liquidity stress testing and return ally to supervisory stress testing on an annual cycle in june the fdic issued a final rule that requires each cidi with billion or more in total assets like ally bank to submit a full resolution plan with an identified strategy from the point of their failure to disposition of substantially all of the cidis assets and operations through winddown liquidation divestiture or other return to the private sector under the final rule the cidi must utilize as its identified strategy the formation or stabilization of a bridge depository institution that continues operations through the completion of the cidis resolution and exit unless the cidi demonstrates why another strategy is more appropriate based upon its size complexity and risk profile all cidis are required to demonstrate capabilities to carry out the sale of the cidi and its assets such capabilities include the capability to maintain continuity of critical services the capability to produce valuations needed in assessing the resolution strategy that is least costly to the fdics deposit insurance fund and the capability to establish a virtual due diligence data room promptly in the runup to or upon failure of the cidi to support the ability of the fdic to market and execute a timely sale or disposition of the cidi and its assets each cidis resolution plan will also be subject to additional requirements including those related to the underlying failure scenario assumptions resolution plan content and fdic reviews of the resolution plan under the final rule cidis not affiliated with us global systemically important banking organizations are subject to a triennial submission cycle in which a full resolution plan is required to be submitted once managements discussion and analysis ally financial inc form 10q every three years with interim supplements due in nonsubmission years the final rule is effective on october we are evaluating the impact of this final rule refer to note to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information in august citing macroeconomic trends impacting the banking industry such as increased costs of funding and rapid tightening in monetary policy moodys downgraded the credit ratings of a number of banks additionally moodys downgraded the outlook of a number of banks including ally where the outlook was lowered from stable to negative refer to the section below titled credit ratings for additional information on november the fdic finalized a rule that imposes a special assessment to recover the costs to the dif resulting from the fdics use in march of the systemic risk exception to the leastcost resolution test under the fdi act in connection with the receiverships of svb and signature the fdic estimated in approving the rule that those assessed losses total approximately billion the rule provides that this loss estimate will be periodically adjusted which will affect the amount of the special assessment under the rule the assessment base is the estimated uninsured deposits that an idi reported in its consolidated reports of condition and income call report at december excluding the first billion in estimated uninsured deposits the special assessments will be collected at an annual rate of approximately basis points per year basis points per quarter over eight quarters in and with the first assessment period beginning january because the estimated loss pursuant to the systemic risk determination will be periodically adjusted the fdic retains the ability to cease collection early extend the special assessment collection period and impose a final shortfall special assessment on a onetime basis ally expects the special assessments to be tax deductible the total of the assessments for ally based on ally banks uninsured deposits as of december was estimated at million as of december during the first quarter of the fdic increased the estimated assessed losses to billion as a result we increased our special assessment estimate by million during the three months ended march to a total of million at march during the second quarter of the fdic decreased the estimated assessed losses to billion additionally the special assessment collection period was updated to include two additional quarters resulting in a total collection period of ten quarters beginning in the second quarter of the special assessment will be collected at an annual rate of approximately basis points per year basis points per quarter over the first eight quarters and approximately basis points per year basis points per quarter over the last two quarters in june the fdic invoiced ally bank for the first installment of the fdic special assessment and included the total expected amount to be invoiced over the ten quarter period of million as a result our fdic special assessment liability decreased million during the
