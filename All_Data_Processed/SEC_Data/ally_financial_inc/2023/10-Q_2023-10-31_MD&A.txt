analysis interest rate risk represents one of our most significant exposures to market risk we actively monitor the level of exposure to movements in interest rates and take actions to mitigate adverse impacts these movements may have on future earnings we use a sensitivity analysis of net financing revenue as our primary metric to measure and manage the interest rate risk of our financial instruments the execution of our current business strategy generally results in shorterduration fixedrate consumer automotive loans comprising the majority of our assets and liquid floatingrate retail deposits comprising the majority of our liabilities this in turn results in a structurally liability sensitive balance sheet as our floatingrate retail deposits reprice faster than our fixedrate consumer automotive loans when interest rates change we prepare forwardlooking baseline forecasts of pretax net financing revenue as well as anticipated future business growth actions to alter our assetliability positioning and interest rates based on the implied forward curve the analysis is highly dependent upon a variety of assumptions one of the most significant being the repricing characteristics of retail deposits with both contractual and noncontractual maturities we monitor industry and competitive repricing activity along with other business and market factors when developing deposit pricing assumptions modeled simulations are then used to assess changes in pretax net financing revenue in multiple interest rate scenarios relative to the baseline forecast the changes in net financing revenue relative to the baseline are defined as the sensitivity our simulations incorporate contractual cash flows and assumed repricing characteristics for assets liabilities and offbalance sheet exposures and incorporate the assumed effects of changing interest rates on the prepayment and attrition rates of certain assets and liabilities our simulations do not assume any specific future actions are taken to mitigate the impacts of changing interest rates managements discussion and analysis ally financial inc form 10q these simulations measure the potential changes in our pretax net financing revenue over the following months we test a number of alternative rate scenarios including immediate and gradual parallel shocks to the implied forward curve we also evaluate nonparallel shocks to interest rates and stresses to certain term points on the yield curve in isolation to capture and monitor a variety of risks simulation results are driven by underlying models and assumptions that are based on trend behavior and other historical information the underlying models and assumptions including retail deposit pricing are regularly monitored evaluated and may be updated accordingly as observed trends materialize as a result if future trends or behaviors deviate from those reflected in the models actual sensitivities may varyperhaps significantlyfrom those that are modeled for example the pace and magnitude of changes in the federalfunds rate during the last two years has challenged models like ours whose historical data is largely derived from a more stable rate environment actual sensitivities may differ for other reasons as well including unplanned changes in balance sheet composition timing of asset and liability repricing the yield curve customer behavior macroeconomic conditions the competitive environment and management strategies accordingly we do not treat the sensitivities as forecasts of net financing revenue but instead use them as a tool in managing interest rate risk in a stable rate scenario that assumes spot rates as of september remain constant through the simulation net financing revenue over the next months is expected to increase by million versus the baseline forecast due to the shape of the implied forward curve the following table presents the pretax dollar impact to baseline forecasted net financing revenue over the next months assuming various parallel shocks to the implied forward curve as of september and december september december gradual a instantaneous gradual a instantaneous change in interest rates in millions in millions basis points basis points basis points a gradual changes in interest rates are recognized over months since december the implied forward curve has increased and steepened modestly during the first three quarters of our floatingrate commercial balances and cash balances increased and we saw a shift from liquid deposits to cds increased our payfixed swap position and incrementally added interest rate floor contracts that will provide benefit in certain lowerrate scenarios the impact of these changes is reflected in our baseline net financing revenue forecast as of september we expect to modestly benefit in the nearterm if rates were to move higher than the forward curve implies this shortterm asset sensitivity is the result of the assumed repricing of our assets and payfixed swap position outpacing the assumed repricing of our liabilities within the 12month horizon we expect a reversion to liability sensitivity and as a result a negative effect on net financing revenue our interestrate risk position is influenced by the impact of hedging activity which primarily consists of interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of certain fixedrate assets and fixedrate debt instruments additionally we use interest rate floor contracts designated as cash flow hedges on certain floatingrate assets the size maturity and mix of our hedging activities are adjusted as our balance sheet alm objectives and the interest rate environment evolve over time our hedging strategies however are not designed to eliminate all interestrate risk and we were adversely affected from rising interest rates in and operating lease residual risk management we are exposed to residual risk on vehicles in the consumer operating lease portfolio

funding highlights from january to date were as follows in february ally financial inc accessed the unsecured debt capital markets and raised million through the issuance of subordinated notes in june ally financial inc raised million through the issuance of unsecured senior notes based on the proposed rule requiring category ii iii and iv firms to maintain minimum amounts of eligible longterm debt we would expect both issuances to qualify under the requirement for covered bank holding companies refer to the section below titled response to banking industry failures for more information about the proposed rule we raised billion through the completion of term securitization transactions backed by consumer automotive loans we issued billion of brokered cds we increased our total available funding capacity through the frb discount window by billion during the nine months ended september to billion as of september the increase in frb discount window capacity reflects our strategy to maintain increased contingent liquidity following the bank failures of early and to further align with the addendum to the interagency policy statement on funding and liquidity risk management importance of contingency funding plans released in july we increased and diversified repurchase agreement transaction funding with our counterparties response to banking industry failures in march the fdic was appointed as receiver for svb and signature after they experienced runs on deposits and other liquidity constraints at the time svb and signature were the 16th and 29th largest banks in the united states respectively as measured by total assets as of december also during march ubs group ag announced the acquisition of credit suisse group ag with the support of the swiss government our liquidity position fundamentally differs from those of svb and signature before their failures for example more than of deposits at ally bank were fdicinsured as of september compared to for svb and for signature as of december additionally our deposit portfolio is primarily composed of granular and diversified retail customer accounts as opposed to svb and signature who had large uninsured commercial deposits because of the market turbulence and uncertainty however we activated existing internal incident response procedures specifically designed to increase governance and monitoring of ally banks depositor behavior liquidity position and risk exposure including frequent ongoing dialogue with the board and supervisory authorities managements discussion and analysis ally financial inc form 10q we also took specific funding actions even before these failures in response to the unprecedented pace of monetary tightening in and the resultant macroeconomic uncertainty we had increased cash and available liquidity refer to the section above titled recent funding developments after the failures we continued to do so by optimizing brokered cd issuances borrowing from the fhlb managing securities collateral pledged to the fhlb maintaining competitive retail deposit pricing and managing new loan origination volumes we had billion of total available liquidity as of september which included billion of available fhlb capacity and billion of available frb discount window capacity refer to the section above titled liquidity risk management fhlb funding provides us with a stable funding source and can be drawn upon on a sameday basis if sufficiently secured with available collateral in support of american businesses and households the frb created the btfp in march to make additional funding available to eligible depository institutions in order to help assure that banks have the ability to meet the needs of all of their depositors the btfp is a further source of liquidity against highquality securities and contributes to financial stability by eliminating a banks need to quickly sell those securities in times of stress under the btfp depository institutions may borrow funds by pledging collateral eligible for purchase by the frb in open market operations such as us treasuries and agency debt and mortgagebacked securities in each case valued at par we did not borrow from the btfp through september as of september we had billion in total available funding capacity through the frb discount window with no debt outstanding during the nine months ended september following the failures of svb and signature on may first republic bank was closed by the california department of financial protection and innovation which appointed the fdic as receiver the fdic entered into a purchase and assumption agreement with jpmorgan chase bank to assume all the deposits and substantially all the assets of first republic bank we continue to monitor and assess the impact of these failures on category iv firms like ally in april in a statement accompanying the review of the frbs supervision and regulation of svb frb vice chair for supervision barr highlighted a plan to revisit the tailoring rules and develop stronger capital liquidity stresstesting and other standards for category iv firms like ally in july the us banking agencies issued a proposed rule to customize and implement revisions to the global basel iii capital framework that had been approved by the basel committee in december commonly known as the basel iii endgame or as basel iv for regulatory capital the proposed rule would eliminate the effect of the tailoring rules by requiring the recognition of most elements of accumulated other comprehensive income and loss and the application of deductions limitations and criteria for specified capital investments minority interests and tlac holdings for each of the riskbased capital ratios a large banking organization like ally would calculate and be bound by the lower of two alternatives one version of the ratio based on an expanded riskbased approach prescribed in the proposed rule and one version of the ratio based on the standardized approach as modified by the proposed rule all capital buffer requirements including the stress capital buffer requirement would apply regardless of whether the expanded riskbased approach or the standardized approach produces the lower ratio under the expanded riskbased approach total rwas would equal the sum of the rwas for credit risk equity risk operational risk market risk and cva risk as set forth in the proposed rule minus any amount of the banking organizations adjusted allowance for credit losses that is not included in tier capital and any amount of allocated transfer risk reserves under the standardized approach total rwas would be calculated using the existing rules with a revised methodology for determining market riskweighted assets and a required application of the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk for derivative exposures category iv firms would be further required under the proposed rule to project their riskbased capital ratios under baseline conditions in their capital plans and related reports using the rwacalculation approach that results in their binding riskbased capital ratios as of the start of the projection horizon the proposed rule also would roll back additional elements of the tailoring rules by applying to category iv firms the supplementary leverage ratio the countercyclical capital buffer and enhanced public disclosure and reporting requirements under the proposed rule a threeyear transition period from july to june would apply to the recognition of accumulated other comprehensive income and loss in regulatory capital and the use of the expanded riskbased approach the phasein of accumulated other comprehensive income and loss is expected to significantly affect our levels of regulatory capital while we believe that this would be manageable we also anticipate that our levels of regulatory capital would need to be gradually increased in advance of and during the proposed transition period as for the proposed changes to rwas while we continue to evaluate the effects of individual provisions and the interplay among them as well as potential management actions in response the impact is not currently expected to be significant in the aggregate if the proposed rule were adopted in its existing form we are actively engaged with research and advocacy groups to inform the rulemaking process and better understand the impacts of the proposed rule on banking organizations of various sizes and complexitiesas well as the competitive environment more broadlyand likewise encourage the us banking agencies to closely study these impacts and their wider implications in august the us banking agencies issued two proposed rules to improve the resolvability of category iv firms like ally the first proposed rule would require category ii iii and iv firms their large consolidated banks and other institutions to issue and maintain minimum amounts of eligible longterm debt in an amount that is the greater of i percent of total rwas ii percent of average total consolidated assets and iii percent of total leverage exposure covered insured depository institutions like ally bank that are consolidated subsidiaries of covered entities like ally would be required to issue eligible longterm debt internally to a company that consolidates the covered insured depository institution which would in turn be required to purchase that longterm debt only longterm debt instruments that are most readily able to absorb losses in a resolution proceeding would qualify and the operations of covered entities would be subject to cleanholdingcompany requirements such as prohibitions and limitations on their liabilities to unaffiliated entities under the proposed rule a transition period would apply with and percent of the longtermdebt requirements coming into effect by the end of the first second and third years respectively after finalization of the rule the second proposed rule which was issued solely by the fdic would require each insured depository institution with billion or more in total assets like ally bank to submit a full resolution plan with an identified strategy for ensuring timely access to insured deposits maximizing value from the disposition of assets minimizing managements discussion and analysis ally financial inc form 10q any losses realized by creditors and addressing potential financialstability risks each resolution plan also would be subject to more stringent standards on its assumptions content and reviews covered insured depository institutions would need to submit a full resolution plan every two years with interim supplements in nonsubmission years we are still assessing the impact of these two proposed rules but due to the current structure and amount of debt instruments issued by ally and ally bank expect the longtermdebt rule in particular to significantly affect us whether and when final rules related to these proposals may be adopted and take effect as well as what changes to the proposed rules may be reflected in any final rules after the comment periods remain unclear also beyond these proposed rules more stringent and less tailored liquidity stresstesting and other standards for category iv firms like ally may be forthcoming including those that may reinstate the lcr require more rigorous liquidity stress testing and return ally to supervisory stress testing on an annual cycle refer to note to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information in august
