item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk table end we manage our assets and liabilities to reduce our exposure to changes in market interest rates the asset and liability management process has three primary objectives to evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in certain balance sheet accounts to determine the appropriate level of risk given our business strategy operating environment capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives and to manage that risk in a manner consistent with guidelines approved by the boards of directors of the company and the bank market risk as a financial institution we are focused on reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility which represents our primary market risk changes in market interest rates represent the greatest challenge to our financial performance as such changes can have a significant impact on the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of our interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities and on the market value of all interestearning assets other than those possessing a short term to maturity to reduce our exposure to changing rates the board of directors and management monitor interest rate sensitivity on a regular or as needed basis so that adjustments to the asset and liability mix can be made when deemed appropriate the actual duration of heldforinvestment mortgage loans and mortgagerelated securities can be significantly impacted by changes in prepayment levels and market interest rates the level of prepayments may in turn be impacted by a variety of factors including the economy in the region where the underlying mortgages were originated seasonal factors demographic variables and the assumability of the underlying mortgages however the factors with the most significant impact on prepayments are market interest rates and the availability of refinancing opportunities in we managed our interest rate risk by taking the following actions we continued to emphasize the origination and retention of intermediateterm assets primarily in the form of multifamily and cre loans we increased our portfolio of ci loans which feature floating rates and we replaced maturing wholesale borrowings with longer term borrowings including some with callable features and we entered into interest rate swaps with a notional amount of billion to hedge certain real estate loans and borrowings libor transition process on july the uk financial conduct authority fca which regulates libor announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after accordingly the frb has recommended an alternative index dubbed the secured overnight financing rate or sofr the bank has established a subcommittee of its alco to address issues related to the phaseout and ultimate transition away from libor to an alternate rate this subcommittee is led by our chief accounting officer and consists of personnel from various departments throughout the bank including lending loan administration credit risk management financetreasury information technology and operations the company has liborbased contracts that extend beyond included in loans and leases securities wholesale borrowings derivative financial instruments and longterm debt the subcommittee has reviewed contract fallback language and noted that certain contracts will need updated provisions for the transition and is coordinating with impacted business lines interest rate sensitivity analysis the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring a banks interest rate sensitivity gap an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time frame if it will mature or reprice within that period of time the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interestearning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time frame and the amount of interestbearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same period of time at december our oneyear gap was a negative as compared to a negative at december the change in our oneyear gap reflects an increase in expected prepayments on loans coupled with the addition of the previously mentioned interest rate swaps partially offset by an increase in cds maturing within one year in a rising interest rate environment an institution with a negative gap would generally be expected absent the effects of other factors to experience a greater increase in the cost of its interestbearing liabilities than it would in the yield on its interestearning assets thus producing a decline in its net interest income conversely in a declining rate environment an institution with a negative gap would generally be expected to experience a lesser reduction in the yield on its interestearning assets than it would in the cost of its interestbearing liabilities thus producing an increase in its net interest income in a rising interest rate environment an institution with a positive gap would generally be expected to experience a greater increase in the yield on its interestearning assets than it would in the cost of its interestbearing liabilities thus producing an increase in its net interest income conversely in a declining rate environment an institution with a positive gap would generally be expected to experience a lesser reduction in the cost of its interestbearing liabilities than it would in the yield on its interestearning assets thus producing a decline in its net interest income the table on the following page sets forth the amounts of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities outstanding at december which based on certain assumptions stemming from our historical experience are expected to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown except as stated below the amounts of assets and liabilities shown as repricing or maturing during a particular time period were determined in accordance with the earlier of the term to repricing or the contractual terms of the asset or liability the table provides an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities at december on the basis of contractual maturities anticipated prepayments and scheduled rate adjustments within a threemonth period and subsequent selected time intervals for residential mortgagerelated securities prepayment rates are forecasted at a weighted average cpr of per annum for multifamily and cre loans prepayment rates are forecasted at weighted average cprs of and per annum respectively borrowed funds were not assumed to prepay savings

accounts were assumed to decay at a rate of for the first five years and for years six through ten interestbearing checking accounts were assumed to decay at a rate of for the first five years and for years six through ten the decay assumptions reflect the prolonged low interest rate environment and the uncertainty regarding future depositor behavior including those accounts having specified

table end table start expected amount based in part on historical experience table end table start the interest rate sensitivity gap per period represents the difference between interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities table end prepayment and deposit decay rates can have a significant impact on our estimated gap while we believe our assumptions to be reasonable there can be no assurance that the assumed prepayment and decay rates noted above will approximate actual future loan and securities prepayments and deposit withdrawal activity to validate our prepayment assumptions for our multifamily and cre loan portfolios we perform a monthly analysis during which we review our historical prepayment rates and compare them to our projected prepayment rates we continually review the actual prepayment rates to ensure that our projections are as accurate as possible since prepayments on these types of loans are not as closely correlated to changes in interest rates as prepayments on onetofour family loans tend to be in addition we review the call provisions in our borrowings and investment portfolios and on a monthly basis compare the actual calls to our projected calls to ensure that our projections are reasonable as of december the impact of a 100basis point decline in market interest rates would have increased our projected prepayment rates for multifamily and cre loans by a constant prepayment rate of per annum conversely the impact of a 100basis point increase in market interest rates would have decreased our projected prepayment rates for multifamily and cre loans by a constant prepayment rate of per annum certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the preceding interest rate sensitivity analysis for example although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of the market while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market interest rates additionally certain assets such as adjustablerate loans have features that restrict changes in interest rates both on a shortterm basis and over the life of the asset furthermore in the event of a change in interest rates prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate from those assumed in calculating the table also the ability of some borrowers to repay their adjustablerate loans may be adversely impacted by an increase in market interest rates interest rate sensitivity is also monitored through the use of a model that generates estimates of the change in our economic value of equity eve over a range of interest rate scenarios eve is defined as the net present value of expected cash flows from assets liabilities and offbalance sheet contracts the eve ratio under any interest rate scenario is defined as the eve in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario the model assumes estimated loan prepayment rates reinvestment rates and deposit decay rates similar to those utilized in formulating the preceding interest rate sensitivity analysis based on the information and assumptions in effect at december the following table sets forth our eve assuming the changes in interest rates noted dollars in thousands table start change in interest rates in basis points market value of assets market value of liabilities economic value of equity net change estimated percentage change in economic value of equity table end table start the impact of a 200bp reduction in interest rates is not presented in view of the current level of the federal funds rate and other shortterm interest rates table end the net changes in eve presented in the preceding table are within the parameters approved by the boards of directors of the company and the bank as with the interest rate sensitivity analysis certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the preceding interest rate risk measurements modeling changes in eve requires that certain assumptions be made which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates in this regard the eve analysis presented above assumes that the composition of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities furthermore the model does not take into account the benefit of any strategic actions we may take to further reduce our exposure to interest rate risk accordingly while the eve analysis provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and may very well differ from actual results we also utilize an internal net interest income simulation to manage our sensitivity to interest rate risk the simulation incorporates various marketbased assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on future levels of our financial assets and liabilities the assumptions used in the net interest income simulation are inherently uncertain actual results may differ significantly from those presented in the following table due to the frequency timing and magnitude of changes in interest rates changes in spreads between maturity and repricing categories and prepayments among other factors coupled with any actions taken to counter the effects of any such changes based on the information and assumptions in effect at december the following table reflects the estimated percentage change in future net interest income for the next twelve months assuming the changes in interest rates noted table start change in interest rates in basis points estimated percentage change in future net interest income over one year over one year over one year table end table start in general short and longterm rates are assumed to increase in parallel fashion across all four quarters and then remain unchanged table end table start the impact of a 200bp reduction in interest rates is not presented in view of the current level of the federal funds rate and other shortterm interest rates table end future changes in our mix of assets and liabilities may result in greater changes to our gap eve andor net interest income simulation in the event that our eve and net interest income sensitivities were to breach our internal policy limits we would undertake the following actions to ensure that appropriate remedial measures were put in place table start our alco committee would inform the board of directors of the variance and present recommendations to the board regarding proposed courses of action to restore conditions to withinpolicy tolerances table end table start in formulating appropriate strategies the alco committee would ascertain the primary causes of the variance from policy tolerances the expected term of such conditions and the projected effect on capital and earnings table end where temporary changes in market conditions or volume levels result in significant increases in risk strategies may involve reducing open positions or employing synthetic hedging techniques to more immediately reduce risk exposure where variance from policy tolerances is triggered by more fundamental imbalances in the risk profiles of core loan and deposit products a remedial strategy may involve restoring balance through natural hedges to the extent possible before employing synthetic hedging techniques other strategies might include table start asset restructuring involving sales of assets having higher risk profiles or a gradual restructuring of the asset mix over time to affect the maturity or repricing schedule of assets table end table start liability restructuring whereby product offerings and pricing are altered or wholesale borrowings are employed to affect the maturity structure or repricing of liabilities table end table start expansion or shrinkage of the balance sheet to correct imbalances in the repricing or maturity periods between assets and liabilities andor table end table start use or alteration of offbalance sheet positions including interest rate swaps caps floors options and forward purchase or sales commitments table end in connection with our net interest income simulation modeling we also evaluate the impact of changes in the slope of the yield curve at december our analysis indicated that an immediate inversion of the yield curve would be expected to result in an decrease in net interest income conversely an immediate steepening of the yield curve would be expected to result in an increase table start
