westchester county in new york essex hudson mercer middlesex monmouth ocean and union counties in new jersey maricopa and yavapai counties in arizona cuyahoga lake and summit counties in ohio and broward collier lee miamidade palm beach and st lucie counties in florida the market for the loans we produce varies depending on the type of loan for example the vast majority of our multifamily loans are collateralized by rental apartment buildings in new york city which is also home to the majority of the properties collateralizing our cre and adc loans in contrast our specialty finance loans and leases are generally made to large corporate obligors that participate in stable industries nationwide competition for deposits the combined population of the counties where our branches are located is approximately million and the number of banks and thrifts we compete with currently exceeds with total deposits of billion at december we ranked thirteenth among all bank and thrift depositories serving these counties we also ranked fourth among all banks and thrifts in union county new jersey third among all banks and thrifts in richmond county in new york fifth among all banks

professional associations we also compete by complementing our broad selection of traditional banking products with an extensive menu of alternative financial services including annuities life and longterm care insurance and mutual funds of various thirdparty service providers our ability to attract and retain deposits is not only a function of shortterm interest rates and industry consolidation but also the competitiveness of the rates being offered by other financial institutions within our marketplace including credit unions online banks and brokerage firms additionally financial technology companies also referred to as fintechs are providing nontraditional but increasingly strong competition for deposits and customers competition for deposits is also influenced by several internal factors including the opportunity to assume or acquire deposits through business combinations the cash flows produced through loan and securities repayments and sales and the availability of attractively priced wholesale funds in addition the degree to which we seek to compete for deposits is influenced by the liquidity needed to fund our loan production and other outstanding commitments another competitive advantage is our strong community presence with april having marked the 161st year of service of our forebear queens county savings bank we have found that our longevity as well as our strong capital position are especially appealing to customers seeking a strong stable and serviceoriented bank competition for loans our success as a lender is substantially tied to the economic health of the markets where we lend local economic conditions have a significant impact on loan demand the value of the collateral securing our credits and the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans the competition we face for loans also varies with the type of loan we are originating in new york city where the majority of the buildings collateralizing our multifamily loans are located we compete for such loans on the basis of timely service and the expertise that stems from being a specialist in this lending niche in addition to the money center regional and local banks we compete with in this market we compete with insurance companies and other types of lenders certain of the banks we compete with sell the loans they produce to fannie mae and freddie mac our ability to compete for cre loans depends on the same factors that impact our ability to compete for multifamily credits and the degree to which other cre lenders choose to offer loan products similar to ours competition for our specialty finance loans which consist primarily of assetbased equipment financing and dealer floor plan loans is driven by a variety of factors including prevailing economic conditions and the level of interest rates moreover since a majority of our customers in this category are midtolarge size publicly traded companies we also face competition for financing from the capital markets in addition the majority of specialty finance loans that we originate are sourced from larger financial institutions who have many customers for these loans some of these customers are larger and have more capital and liquidity than the company while we continue to originate adc and ci loans for investment such loans represent a small portion of our loan portfolio as compared to multifamily cre loans and specialty finance loans environmental issues we encounter certain environmental risks in our lending activities and other operations the existence of hazardous materials may make it unattractive for a lender to foreclose on the properties securing its loans in addition under certain conditions lenders may become liable for the costs of cleaning up hazardous materials found on such properties we attempt to mitigate such environmental risks by requiring either that a borrower purchase environmental insurance or that an appropriate environmental site assessment be completed as part of our underwriting review on the initial granting of cre and adc loans regardless of location and of any outofstate multifamily loans we may produce depending on the results of an assessment appropriate measures are taken to address the identified risks in addition we order an updated environmental analysis prior to foreclosing on such properties and typically hold foreclosed multifamily cre and adc properties in subsidiaries our attention to environmental risks also applies to the properties and facilities that house our bank operations prior to acquiring a largescale property a phase environmental property assessment is typically performed by a licensed professional engineer to determine the integrity of andor the potential risk associated with the facility and the property on which it is built properties and facilities of a smaller scale are evaluated by qualified inhouse assessors as well as by industry experts in environmental testing and remediation this twopronged approach identifies potential risks associated with asbestoscontaining material above and underground storage tanks radon electrical transformers which may contain pcbs ground water flow storm and sanitary discharge and mold among other environmental risks these processes assist us in mitigating environmental risk by enabling us to identify and address potential issues including by avoiding taking ownership or control of contaminated properties subsidiary activities the bank has formed or acquired through merger transactions active

and analysis of financial condition and results of operations later in this annual report regulation and supervision general the bank is a new york statechartered savings bank and its deposit accounts are insured under the dif of the fdic up to applicable legal limits for the fiscal year ended december the bank was subject to regulation and supervision by the nysdfs as its chartering agency by the fdic as primary federal supervisor for all statechartered banks and savings institutions that are not members of the federal reserve system and by the cfpb the bank is required to file reports with the nysdfs the fdic and the cfpb concerning its activities and financial condition and is periodically examined by the nysdfs the fdic and the cfpb to assess compliance with various regulatory requirements including with respect to safety and soundness and consumer financial protection regulations the regulatory structure gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of an adequate allowance for credit losses on loans and leases for regulatory purposes changes in such regulations or in banking legislation could have a material impact on the company the bank and their operations as well as the companys shareholders the company is subject to examination regulation and periodic reporting under the bank holding company act of as amended the bhca by the frb furthermore the company would be required to obtain the prior approval of the frb to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank or bank holding company in addition the company is periodically examined by the frbny and is required to file certain reports under and otherwise comply with the rules and regulations of the sec under federal securities laws certain of the regulatory requirements applicable to the bank and the company are referred to below or elsewhere herein however such discussion is not meant to be a complete explanation of all laws and regulations and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual laws and regulations the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act enacted in july the dfa significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and will continue to affect into the immediate future the lending and investment activities and general operations of depository institutions and their holding companies the dfa is complex and comprehensive legislation that impacts practically all aspects of a banking organization and represents a significant overhaul of many aspects of the regulation of the financial services industry the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act on may the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act the egrrcpa was signed into law as enacted egrrcpa modified major provisions of the dfa and other laws governing regulation of the financial industry among other things egrrcpa redefined the manner by which banks are designated as a sifi by increasing the asset threshold to billion from billion modified and provided exemptions to certain mortgage lending rules provided an exemption for certain banks with less than billion in assets from leverage and riskbased capital requirements created an exemption from prohibitions on proprietary trading the volcker rule and included various provisions to address consumer protection as well as several provisions regarding securities exchanges and capital formation the new york housing stability and tenant protection act of on june the new york state legislature passed the housing stability and tenant protection act of impacting about one million rentregulated apartment units among other things the new legislation i curtails rent increases from material capital improvements and individual apartment improvements ii all but eliminates the ability for apartments to exit rent regulation iii does away with vacancy decontrol and high income deregulation and iv repealed the vacancy bonus while it will take several years for its full impact to be known the legislation generally limits a landlords ability to increase rents on rentregulated apartments and makes it more difficult to convert rent regulated apartments to market rent apartments capital requirements in early july the frb and the fdic approved revisions to their capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action rules to implement the revised standards of the basel committee on banking supervision commonly called basel iii and to address relevant provisions of the dfa basel iii generally refers to two consultative documents released by the basel committee on banking supervision in december the basel iii rules generally refer to the rules adopted by us banking regulators in december to align us bank capital requirements with basel iii and with the related loss absorbency rules they issued in january which include significant changes to bank capital leverage and liquidity requirements the basel iii rules include new riskbased capital and leverage ratios which became effective january and revised the definition of what constitutes capital for the purposes of calculating those ratios under basel iii the company and the bank are required to maintain minimum capital in accordance with the following ratios i a common equity tier capital ratio of ii a tier capital ratio of increased from iii a total capital ratio of unchanged from the prior rules and iv a tier leverage ratio of in addition the basel iii rules assign higher risk weights to certain assets such as the risk weighting assigned to exposures that are more than days past due or are on nonaccrual status and to certain cre facilities that finance the acquisition development or construction of real property basel iii also eliminate the inclusion of certain instruments such as trust preferred securities from tier capital in addition tier capital is no longer limited to the amount of tier capital included in total capital mortgage servicing rights certain deferred tax assets and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries over designated percentages of common stock are required subject to limitation to be deducted from capital finally tier capital includes accumulated other comprehensive income which includes all unrealized gains and losses on availableforsale securities basel iii also established a capital conservation buffer consisting entirely of common equity tier capital that is above the new regulatory minimum capital requirements this resulted in an increase in the minimum common equity tier tier and total capital ratios to and respectively the phasein of the new capital conservation buffer requirement was fully implemented in january the capital conservation buffer is now at its fully phasedin level of an institution can be subject to limitations on paying dividends engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital levels fall below these amounts basel iii also establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such capital distributions on september the frb the fdic and the occ issued a final rule designed to reduce regulatory burden by simplifying several requirements in the agencies regulatory capital rule most aspects of the rule apply only to banking organizations that are not subject to the advanced approaches in the capital rule which are generally firms with less than billion in total consolidated assets and less than billion in total foreign exposure the rule simplifies and clarifies a number of the more complex aspects of the existing capital rule specifically the rule simplifies the capital treatment for certain mortgage servicing assets certain deferred tax assets investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions and minority interests prompt corrective regulatory action the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia requires among other things that federal bank regulatory authorities take prompt corrective action with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements for such purposes the law establishes five capital tiers well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized the five capital tiers are described in more detail below under the prompt corrective action regulations an institution that fails to remain well capitalized becomes subject to a series of restrictions that increase in severity as its capital condition weakens such restrictions may include a prohibition on capital distributions restrictions on asset growth or restrictions on the ability to receive regulatory approval of applications the fdicia also provides for enhanced supervision authority over undercapitalized institutions including authority for the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution as a result of the basel iii rules new definitions of the relevant measures for the five capital categories took effect on january an institution is deemed to be well capitalized if it has a total riskbased capital ratio of or greater a tier riskbased capital ratio of or greater a common equity tier riskbased capital ratio of or greater and a tier leverage ratio of or greater and is not subject to a regulatory order agreement or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure an institution is deemed to be adequately capitalized if it has a total riskbased capital ratio of or greater a tier riskbased capital ratio of or greater a common equity tier riskbased capital ratio of or greater and a tier leverage ratio of or greater an institution is deemed to be undercapitalized if it has a total riskbased capital ratio of less than a tier riskbased capital ratio of less than a common equity tier riskbased capital ratio of less than or a tier leverage ratio of less than an institution is deemed to be significantly undercapitalized if it has a total riskbased capital ratio of less than a tier riskbased capital ratio of less than a common equity tier riskbased capital ratio of less than or a tier leverage ratio of less than an institution is deemed to be critically undercapitalized if it has a ratio of tangible equity as defined in the regulations to total assets that is equal to or less than undercapitalized institutions are subject to growth capital distribution including dividend and other limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan an institutions compliance with such a plan is required to be guaranteed by any company that controls the undercapitalized institution in an amount equal to the lesser of of the banks total assets when deemed undercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve the status of adequately capitalized if an undercapitalized institution fails to submit an acceptable plan it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized institutions are subject to one or more additional restrictions including but not limited to an order by the fdic to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized requirements to reduce total assets cease receipt of deposits from correspondent banks or dismiss directors or officers and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits compensation of executive officers and capital distributions by the parent holding company beginning days after becoming critically undercapitalized critically undercapitalized institutions also may not make any payment of principal or interest on certain subordinated debt extend credit for a highly leveraged transaction or enter into any material transaction outside the ordinary course of business in addition subject to a narrow exception the appointment of a receiver is required for a critically undercapitalized institution within days after it obtains such status as of december each of the banks capital ratios exceeded those required for an institution to be considered well capitalized under these regulations stress testing stress testing for systemically important financial institutions should the fourquarter average of our total consolidated assets exceed billion we would become subject to the frbs stress testing regulations administered under its ccar capital planning and supervisory process under this regime in addition to reporting the results of a sifis own capital stress testing the frb uses its own models to evaluate whether each sifi has the capital on a total consolidated basis necessary to continue operating under the economic and financial market conditions of stressed macroeconomic scenarios identified by the frb the frbs analysis includes an assessment of the projected losses net income and pro forma capital levels and the regulatory capital ratio tier common ratio and other capital ratios for the sifi and uses such analytical techniques that the frb determines to be appropriate to identify measure and monitor any risks of the sifi that may affect the financial stability of the united states boards of directors of sifis are required to review and approve capital plans before they are submitted to the frb in october the fdic issued a final rule which became effective on november that revised the fdics requirement for stress testing by fdicinsured institutions consistent with changes made by the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act the rule amended the fdics existing stress testing regulations to change the minimum threshold for applicability from billion to billion revised the frequency of required stress tests by fdicsupervised institutions from annual to periodic and reduced the number of required stress testing scenarios from three to two standards for safety and soundness federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe for the depository institutions under its jurisdiction standards that relate to among other things internal controls information and audit systems loan documentation credit underwriting the monitoring of interest rate risk asset growth compensation fees and benefits and such other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate the federal banking agencies adopted final regulations and interagency guidelines establishing standards for safety and soundness the guidelines to implement these safety and soundness standards the guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired if the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines the agency may require the institution to provide it with an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard as required by the federal deposit insurance act as amended the fdi act fdic regulations the discussion that follows pertains to fdic regulations other than those already discussed on the preceding pages real estate lending standards the fdic and the other federal banking agencies have adopted regulations that prescribe standards for extensions of credit that i are secured by real estate or ii are made for the purpose of financing construction or improvements on real estate the fdic regulations require each institution to establish and maintain written internal real estate lending standards that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices and appropriate to the size of the institution and the nature and scope of its real estate lending activities the standards also must be consistent with accompanying fdic guidelines which include loantovalue limitations for the different types of real estate loans institutions are also permitted to make a limited amount of loans that do not conform to the proposed loantovalue limitations as long as such exceptions are reviewed and justified appropriately the fdic guidelines also list a number of lending situations in which exceptions to the loantovalue standards are justified the fdic the occ and the frb collectively the agencies also have issued joint guidance entitled concentrations in commercial real estate lending sound risk management practices the cre guidance the cre guidance which addresses land development construction and certain multifamily loans as well as cre loans does not establish specific lending limits but rather reinforces and enhances the agencies existing regulations and guidelines for such lending and portfolio management specifically the cre guidance provides that a bank has a concentration in cre lending if total reported loans for construction land development and other land represent or more of total riskbased capital or total reported loans secured by multifamily properties nonfarm nonresidential properties excluding those that are owneroccupied and loans for construction land development and other land represent or more of total riskbased capital and the banks cre loan portfolio has increased or more during the prior months if a concentration is present management must employ heightened risk management practices that address key elements including board and management oversight and strategic planning portfolio management development of underwriting standards risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing and maintenance of increased capital levels as needed to support the level of cre lending on december the agencies issued a final rule which became effective on april to modify the agencies capital rules for high volatility cre hvcre exposures as required by the egrrcpa the final rule revises the definition of hvcre exposure to make it consistent with the statutory definition of the term included in section of the egrrcpa which excludes any loan made before january the revised hvcre exposure definition differs from the previous definition primarily in two ways first the previous definition applied to loans that financed adc activities whereas the new definition only applies to loans that primarily finance adc activities and that are secured by land or improved real estate this change excludes multipurpose credit facilities that primarily finance the purchase of equipment or other nonadc activities second the new definition permits the full appraised value of borrowercontributed land less the total amount of any liens on the real property securing the hvcre exposure to count toward the percent capital contribution of the real propertys appraised as completed value which is one of the criteria for an exemption from the heightened risk weight the final rule includes a grandfathering provision which will provide banking organizations with the option to maintain their current capital treatment for adc loans originated on or after january and before april banking organizations also will have the option to reevaluate any or all of their adc loans originated on or after january using the revised hvcre exposure definition dividend limitations the fdic has authority to use its enforcement powers to prohibit a savings bank or commercial bank from paying dividends if in its opinion the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice federal law prohibits the payment of dividends that will result in the institution failing to meet applicable capital requirements on a pro forma basis the bank is also subject to dividend declaration restrictions imposed by and as later discussed under new york state law investment activities since the enactment of the fdicia all statechartered financial institutions including savings banks commercial banks and their subsidiaries have generally been limited to such activities as principal and equity investments of the type and in the amount authorized for national banks the glba and fdic regulations impose certain quantitative and qualitative restrictions on such activities and on a banks dealings with a subsidiary that engages in specified activities in the bank received grandfathering authority from the fdic which it continues to use to invest in listed stocks andor registered shares subject to the maximum permissible investments of of tier capital as specified by the fdics regulations or the maximum amount permitted by new york state banking law whichever is less such grandfathering authority is subject to termination upon the fdics determination that such investments pose a safety and soundness risk to the bank or in the event that the bank converts its charter or undergoes a change in control enforcement the fdic has extensive enforcement authority over insured banks including the bank this enforcement authority includes among other things the ability to assess civil money penalties to issue cease and desist orders and to remove directors and officers in general these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices insurance of deposit accounts the deposits of the bank are insured up to applicable limits by the dif the maximum deposit insurance provided by the fdic per account owner is for all types of accounts under the fdics riskbased assessment system insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based upon supervisory evaluations regulatory capital level and certain other factors with less risky institutions paying lower assessments based on the assigned risk levels an institutions assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned and certain other factors assessment rates range from to basis points of the institutions assessment base which is calculated as average total assets minus average tangible equity insurance of deposits may be terminated by the fdic upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law regulation rule order or condition imposed by the fdic management does not know of any practice condition or violation that would lead to termination of the deposit insurance for the bank holding company regulations federal regulation the company is currently subject to examination regulation and periodic reporting under the bhca as administered by the frb the company is required to obtain the prior approval of the frb to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank or bank holding company prior frb approval would be required for the company to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if after giving effect to such acquisition it would directly or indirectly own or control more than of any class of voting shares of such bank or bank holding company in addition before any bank acquisition can be completed prior approval thereof may also be required to be obtained from other agencies having supervisory jurisdiction over the bank to be acquired including the nysdfs frb regulations generally prohibit a bank holding company from engaging in or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than of the voting securities of any company engaged in nonbanking activities one of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities found by the frb to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto some of the principal activities that the frb has determined by regulation to be so closely related to banking are i making or servicing loans ii performing certain data processing services iii providing discount brokerage services iv acting as fiduciary investment or financial advisor v leasing personal or real property vi making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare and vii acquiring a savings and loan association the frb has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends by bank holding companies in general the frbs policies provide that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the bank holding company appears consistent with the organizations capital needs asset quality and overall financial condition the frbs policies also require that a bank holding company serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary bank by standing ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to the bank during periods of financial stress or adversity and by maintaining the financial flexibility and capitalraising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary bank where necessary the dfa codified the source of financial strength policy and required regulations to facilitate its application under the prompt corrective action laws the ability of a bank holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized these regulatory policies could affect the ability of the company to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions the status of the company as a registered bank holding company under the bhca does not exempt it from certain federal and state laws and regulations applicable to corporations generally including without limitation certain provisions of the federal securities laws new york state regulation the company is subject to regulation as a multibank holding company under new york state law among other requirements this means that the company must receive the approval of the superintendent prior to the acquisition of or more of the voting stock of another banking institution or to otherwise acquire a banking institution by merger or purchase transactions with affiliates under current federal law transactions between depository institutions and their affiliates are governed by sections and of the federal reserve act and the frbs regulation w promulgated thereunder generally section limits the extent to which the institution or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate to an amount equal to of the institutions capital stock and surplus and contains an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to of such capital stock and surplus section also establishes specific collateral requirements for loans or extensions of credit to or guarantees or acceptances on letters of credit issued on behalf of an affiliate section requires that covered transactions and a broad list of other specified transactions be on terms substantially the same as or at least as favorable to the institution or its subsidiaries as similar transactions with nonaffiliates the sarbanesoxley act of generally prohibits loans by the company to its executive officers and directors however the sarbanesoxley act contains a specific exemption for loans made by an institution to its executive officers and directors in compliance with other federal banking laws section 22h of the federal reserve act and frb regulation o adopted thereunder govern loans by a savings bank or commercial bank to directors executive officers and principal shareholders community reinvestment act federal regulation under the cra as implemented by fdic regulations an institution has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with its safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community including low and moderate income neighborhoods the cra generally does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institutions discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community consistent with the cra in its most recent fdic cra performance evaluation the bank received overall state ratings of satisfactory for ohio florida arizona and new jersey as well as for the new yorknew jersey multistate region furthermore the most recent overall fdic cra ratings for the bank was satisfactory new york state regulation the bank is also subject to provisions of the new york state banking law that impose continuing and affirmative obligations upon a banking institution organized in new york state to serve the credit needs of its local community such obligations are substantially similar to those imposed by the cra the latest new york state cra rating received by the bank was outstanding bank secrecy and antimoney laundering federal laws and regulations impose obligations on us financial institutions including banks and brokerdealer subsidiaries to implement and maintain appropriate policies procedures and controls that are reasonably designed to prevent detect and report instances of money laundering and the financing of terrorism and to verify the identity of their customers in addition these provisions require the federal financial institution
