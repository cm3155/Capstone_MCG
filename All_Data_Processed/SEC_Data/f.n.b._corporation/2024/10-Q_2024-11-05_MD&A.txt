changes in critical accounting policies or the assumptions and judgments utilized in applying these policies since december use of nongaap financial measures and key performance indicators to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with gaap we use certain nongaap financial measures such as operating net income available to common stockholders operating earnings per diluted common share return on average tangible common equity operating return on average tangible common equity return on average tangible assets tangible book value per common share the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets preprovision net revenue reported operating preprovision net revenue operating noninterest expense net loan chargeoffs excluding an isolated commercial loan chargeoff due to alleged fraud annualized to total average loans and leases efficiency ratio and net interest margin fte to provide information useful to investors in understanding our operating performance and trends and to facilitate comparisons with the performance of our peers management uses these measures internally to assess and better understand our underlying business performance and trends related to core business activities the nongaap financial measures and key performance indicators we use may differ from the nongaap financial measures and key performance indicators other financial institutions use to assess their performance and trends these nongaap financial measures should be viewed as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for or superior to our reported results prepared in accordance with gaap when nongaap financial measures are disclosed the secs regulation g requires i the presentation of the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap and ii a reconciliation of the differences between the nongaap financial measure presented and the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap reconciliations of nongaap operating measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures are included later in this report under the

impacting earnings as they are deemed to be outside of ordinary banking activities these costs are specific to each individual transaction and may vary significantly based on the size and complexity of the transaction to facilitate peer comparisons of net interest margin and efficiency ratio we use net interest income on a taxableequivalent basis in calculating net interest margin by increasing the interest income earned on taxexempt assets loans and investments to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments this adjustment is not permitted under gaap

continued to experience balance migration into higheryielding deposit products we ended the quarter with approximately of all deposits insured by the fdic or collateralized capital resources and regulatory matters our capital position depends in part on the access to and cost of funding for new business initiatives the ability to engage in expanded business activities the ability to pay dividends and the level and nature of regulatory oversight the assessment of capital adequacy depends on a number of factors such as expected organic growth in the consolidated balance sheet asset quality liquidity earnings performance and sustainability changing competitive conditions regulatory changes or actions and economic forces we seek to maintain a strong capital base to support our growth and expansion activities to provide stability to current operations and to promote public confidence pursuant to and in compliance with applicable sec laws rules and regulations we may from

e fixed rate floating rate noncumulative perpetual preferred stock in the amount of million the preferred stock is no longer outstanding and dividends will no longer accrue on such securities capital management is a continuous process with capital plans and stress testing for fnb and fnbpa updated at least annually these capital plans include assessing the adequacy of expected capital levels assuming various scenarios by projecting capital needs for a forecast period of years beyond the current year from time to time we issue shares initially acquired by us as treasury stock under our various benefit plans we may issue additional preferred or common stock to maintain our wellcapitalized status fnb and fnbpa are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies quantitative measures established by regulators to ensure capital adequacy require fnb and fnbpa to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total tier and cet1 capital as defined in the regulations to riskweighted assets as defined and of leverage ratio as defined failure to meet minimum capital requirements could lead to initiation of certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could have a direct material effect on our consolidated financial statements dividends and future business and corporate strategies under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action fnb and fnbpa must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets liabilities and certain offbalance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices fnbs and fnbpas capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components risk weightings and other factors at september the capital levels of both fnb and fnbpa exceeded all regulatory capital requirements and their regulatory capital ratios were above the minimum levels required to be considered wellcapitalized for regulatory purposes in december the frb and other us banking agencies approved a rule to address the impact of cecl on regulatory capital by allowing bank holding companies bhcs and banks including fnb the option to phase in the dayone impact of cecl over a threeyear period in march the frb and other us banking agencies issued a final rule that became effective on march and provides bhcs and banks with an alternative option to temporarily delay the impact of cecl relative to the incurred loss methodology for the acl on regulatory capital we have elected this alternative option instead of the one described in the december rule as a result under the final rule we delayed recognizing the estimated impact of cecl on regulatory capital until after a twoyear deferral period which for us extended through december beginning on january we were required to phase in of the previously deferred capital impact of cecl with an additional to be phased in at the beginning of each subsequent year until fully phased in by the first quarter of under the final rule the estimated impact of cecl on regulatory capital that we will defer and later phase in is calculated as the entire dayone impact at adoption plus of the subsequent change in the acl during the twoyear deferral period as of september the total deferred impact on cet1 capital related to our adoption of cecl was approximately million or basis points which will be eliminated in in this unprecedented economic and uncertain environment we frequently run stress tests for a variety of economic situations including severely adverse scenarios that have economic conditions like the current conditions under these scenarios the results of these stress tests indicate that our regulatory capital ratios would remain above the regulatory requirements and we would be able to maintain appropriate liquidity levels demonstrating our expected ability to continue

represent the minimum requirements needed to avoid limitations on distributions of dividends and certain discretionary bonus payments doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of doddfrank act the doddfrank act broadly affects the financial services industry by establishing a framework for systemic risk oversight creating a resolution authority for institutions determined to be systemically important mandating higher capital and liquidity requirements requiring banks to pay increased fees to regulatory agencies and containing numerous other provisions aimed at strengthening the sound operation of the financial services sector that significantly change the system of regulatory oversight as described in more detail under part i item business government supervision and regulation included in our annual report on form 10k as filed with the sec on february liquidity our primary liquidity management goal is to satisfy the cash flow requirements of customers and the operating cash needs of fnb with costeffective funding our board of directors has established an assetliability management policy to guide management in achieving and maintaining earnings performance consistent with longterm goals while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate risk a wellcapitalized balance sheet and appropriate levels of liquidity our board of directors has also established liquidity and contingency funding policies to guide management in addressing the ability to identify measure monitor and control both normal and stressed liquidity conditions these policies designate our alco as the body responsible for meeting these objectives the alco which is comprised of members of executive management reviews liquidity on a continuous basis and approves significant changes in strategies that affect balance sheet or cash flow positions liquidity is centrally managed daily by our treasury department parent company liquidity the parent companys funding requirements primarily consist of shareholder dividends debt service income taxes operating expenses funding of nonbank subsidiaries and stock repurchases the parent companys funding sources primarily consist of dividends and interest received from the bank and other direct subsidiaries net taxes collected from subsidiaries included in the consolidated tax returns fees for services provided to subsidiaries and the issuance of debt instruments the dividends received from the bank and other direct subsidiaries may be impacted by the parents or its subsidiaries capital and liquidity needs statutory laws and regulations corporate policies contractual restrictions profitability and other factors in addition through one of our subsidiaries we regularly issue subordinated notes which are guaranteed by fnb management utilizes various strategies to ensure sufficient cash on hand is available to meet the parent companys funding needs during the third quarter of we completed a senior debt offering for million in net proceeds a portion of these proceeds was used to retire debt that matured in february for additional information see note borrowings in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this report we have historically been opportunistic when accessing the capital markets and we will continue with that strategy the parent companys cash position at september was million down million from yearend primarily due to the redemption of all million of our series e fixed rate floating rate noncumulative perpetual preferred stock in february the board of directors declared the redemption of the preferred stock given its higher relative cost of capital and our strong capital position our regulatory cet1 ratio and total capital ratios were and respectively at september with the total capital ratio reflecting the completed preferred stock redemption two metrics that are used to gauge the adequacy of the parent companys cash position are the liquidity coverage ratio lcr and months of cash on hand mch the lcr is defined as the sum of cash on hand plus projected cash inflows over the next months divided by projected cash outflows over the next months the mch is defined as the number of months of corporate expenses and dividends that can be covered by the existing cash on hand the lcr and mch ratios and parent company cash on hand are presented in the following table table september december internal limit liquidity coverage ratio times times time months of cash on hand months months months parent company cash on hand millions na as previously mentioned our parent company cash on hand declined from december due to the preferred stock redemption the decrease in the lcr and mch at september are due to the scheduled maturity of million in senior debt due in august of which is considered a cash outflow for the ratio calculations assuming we replace the maturing senior debt the ratios would be times lcr and mch management has concluded that our cash levels remain appropriate given the current market environment bank liquidity banklevel liquidity sources from assets include payments from loans and investments as well as the ability to securitize pledge or sell loans investment securities and other assets liquidity sources from liabilities are generated primarily through the banking offices of fnbpa in the form of deposits and customer repurchase agreements the bank also has access to reliable and costeffective wholesale sources of liquidity short and longterm funds are available for use to help fund normal business operations and unused credit availability can be utilized to serve as contingency funding if faced with a liquidity crisis over time our liquidity position has been positively impacted by fnbpas ability to generate growth in relationshipbased accounts organic growth in lowcost transaction deposits has been complemented by managements continued strategy of deposit gathering efforts focused on attracting new customer relationships across our geographic footprint and deepening relationships with existing customers in part through internal lead generation efforts leveraging our data analytics capabilities these strategies helped management successfully grow total deposits by billion when compared to december these efforts resulted in time deposits and interestbearing demand deposits increasing billion and billion respectively when compared to december noninterestbearing demand deposits decreased million and savings account balances declined million compared to december as customers continue to migrate deposits into higheryielding deposit products the mix of noninterestbearing deposits to total deposits remained consistent with the prior quarter at at september approximately of our deposits were insured by the fdic or collateralized stable with december the liquidity position of fnbpa was further strengthened by the sale of million of indirect auto loans in the third quarter of our cash balances held at the frb were billion at september and billion at december management will continue to evaluate appropriate levels of liquidity based on expected loan and deposit growth and other balance sheet activity the following table presents certain information relating to fnbpas credit availability and salable unpledged securities table  in millions september december unused wholesale credit availability unused wholesale credit availability as a of fnbpa assets salable unpledged government and agency securities salable unpledged government and agency securities as a of fnbpa assets cash and salable unpledged government and agency securities as a of fnbpa assets our banklevel liquidity position has remained strong throughout the strong deposit generation noted earlier provided management the flexibility to reduce short and longterm borrowings by a combined million our contingency funding policy and periodic liquidity stress testing of multiple stress scenarios is particularly valuable as we successfully manage our liquidity we continue to have ample unused borrowing capacity that could cover times the uninsured deposit and noncollateralized deposit balances as of september a portion of this capacity includes the frbs discount window we have no borrowings under this facility additional sources of unused wholesale credit availability for fnbpa include the ability to borrow from the fhlb correspondent bank lines and access to other funding channels in addition to credit availability fnbpa also has salable unpledged government and agency securities that could be utilized to meet funding needs and has excess cash to meet its pledging requirements at september fnbpa has million of cash and salable unpledged government and agency securities representing of total assets this compares to a policy minimum of another metric for measuring liquidity risk is the liquidity gap analysis the following liquidity gap analysis as of september compares the difference between our cash flows from existing earning assets and interestbearing liabilities over future time intervals management calculates this ratio at least quarterly and it is reviewed regularly by alco management monitors the size of the liquidity gaps so that sources and uses of funds are reasonably matched in the normal course of business and in relation to implied forward rate expectations a reasonably matched position lays a better foundation for dealing with additional funding needs during a potential liquidity crisis a positive gap position means that more assets are expected to mature over the next months than liabilities the allocation of nonmaturity deposits and customer repurchase agreements to the twelvemonth categories is based on the estimated lives of each product table  in millions within month months months months total year assets loans investments liabilities nonmaturity deposits time deposits borrowings period gap assets liabilities cumulative gap cumulative gap to total assets the twelvemonth cumulative gap to total assets ratio was as of september compared to as of december the change in the twelvemonth cumulative gap to total assets was primarily related to managements shorterterm time deposit pricing that effectively reduced the average maturity of new time deposits which reduced our asset sensitivity in addition the alco regularly monitors various liquidity ratios stress scenarios of our liquidity position and assumptions considering market disruptions lending demand deposit behavior and funding availability the stress scenarios forecast that adequate funding will be available even under severe conditions management believes we have sufficient liquidity available to meet our normal operating and contingency funding cash needs market risk market risk refers to potential losses arising predominately from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices interest rate risk is comprised of repricing risk basis risk yield curve risk and options risk we are primarily exposed to interest rate risk inherent in our lending and deposittaking activities as a financial intermediary to succeed in this capacity we offer an extensive variety of financial products to meet the diverse needs of our customers these products sometimes contribute to interest rate risk for us when product groups do not complement one another for example depositors may want shortterm deposits while borrowers may desire longterm loans changes in market interest rates may result in changes in the fair value of our financial instruments cash flows and net interest income subject to its ongoing oversight the board of directors has given alco the responsibility for market risk management which involves devising policy guidelines risk measures and limits and managing the amount of interest rate risk and its effect on net interest income and capital we use derivative financial instruments for interest rate risk management purposes and not for trading or speculative purposes we use an assetliability model to measure our interest rate risk interest rate risk measures we utilize include earnings simulation eve and gap analysis gap analysis and eve are static measures that do not incorporate assumptions regarding future business gap analysis while a helpful diagnostic tool displays cash flows for only a single rate environment eves longterm horizon helps identify changes in optionality and longerterm positions however eves liquidation perspective does not translate into the earningsbased measures that are the focus of managing and valuing a going concern net interest income simulations explicitly measure the exposure to earnings from changes in market rates of interest in these simulations our current financial position is combined with assumptions regarding future business activities to calculate net interest income under various hypothetical rate scenarios the alco regularly reviews earnings simulations over multiple years under various interest rate scenarios reviewing these various measures provides us with a comprehensive view of our interest rate risk profile which provides the basis for balance sheet management strategies the following repricing gap analysis as of september compares the difference between the amount of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities subject to repricing the allocation of nonmaturity deposits and customer repurchase agreements to the onemonth maturity category below is based on the estimated sensitivity of each product to changes in market rates for example if a products rate is estimated to increase by as much as the market rates then of the account balance was placed in this category management utilizes the repricing gap analysis as a diagnostic tool in managing net interest income and eve risk measures table  in millions within month months months months total year assets loans investments liabilities nonmaturity deposits time deposits borrowings offbalance sheet period gap assets liabilities offbalance sheet cumulative gap cumulative gap to earning assets the twelvemonth cumulative repricing gap to total assets was and as of september and december respectively primarily as a result of managements deposit pricing actions on shorterterm time deposits which effectively reduced the average maturity of new time deposits the positive cumulative gap positions indicate that we have a greater amount of repricing earning assets than repricing interestbearing liabilities over the subsequent twelve months the change in the cumulative repricing gap at september compared to december is primarily related to customers moving into shorterterm time deposits and the increase in shortterm and variablerate borrowings in addition to the repricing gap analysis above we model rate scenarios which move all rates gradually over twelve months rate ramps we also model rate scenarios which move all rates in an immediate and parallel fashion rate shocks and model scenarios that gradually change the shape of the yield curve using a static balance sheet structure and utilizing net interest income simulations the following table presents an analysis of the potential sensitivity of our net interest income to changes in interest rates using rate ramps and the sensitivity of eve using rate shocks the variance percentages represent the change between the net interest income and eve calculated under the particular rate scenario compared to the net interest income and eve that was calculated assuming market rates as of september the calculated results do not reflect managements potential actions table september december alco limits net interest income change over months rate ramps basis points basis points basis points basis points economic value of equity rate shocks basis points basis points basis points basis points basis points there are multiple factors that influence our interest rate risk position and impact net interest income these include external factors such as the shape of the yield curve the competitive landscape and expectations regarding future interest rates as well as internal factors regarding product offerings product mix and pricing and repricing of loans and deposits our current interest rate risk position is modestly asset sensitive a key driver of this position resulted from the origination of consumer and commercial loans with shortterm repricing characteristics some of which have been swapped to a fixed rate total variable and adjustablerate loans were and of total net loans and leases at september and december respectively fortyeight percent of our net loans and leases reprice within the next three months and are indexed to shortterm sofr prime and other indices furthermore we regularly sell longterm fixedrate residential mortgages in the secondary market management continues to be proactive in managing our interest rate risk irr position with the intention to manage to a more neutral position given the current market expectations for future interest rates during the first nine months of management adjusted the irr position by slightly extending the duration of the investment securities portfolio originating adjustablerate mortgage loans with longerduration fixedrate reset periods strategically meeting our customers preferences for higher yielding deposit products with shorterterm time deposits and utilizing borrowings of variable rates and varying maturities as a result the net interest income change over months shown above in both the up and down rate ramp scenarios is closer to neutral compared to december we also utilize derivatives to manage the irr position these positions are used to protect the fair value of assets and liabilities by converting the contractual interest rate on a specified amount ie notional amounts to another interest rate index or to hedge the variability in cash flows attributable to the contractually specified interest rate by converting the variable rate index into a fixed rate the volume maturity and mix of derivative positions change periodically as we adjust our broader interest rate risk management objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged we currently have billion notional of receivefixed interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges for variable rate commercial loans that have an average rate of and average maturity of months with the last hedge scheduled to expire in may additionally we have a million notional interest rate collar on variable rate commercial loans with strike rates between and that matures in april we also designated billion notional of interest rate swaps as hedges of variable rate shortterm debt maturing in november derivative financial instruments are also offered to enable commercial customers to meet their financing and investing objectives and for their risk management purposes we typically enter into offsetting thirdparty contracts with reputable counterparties with substantially matching terms to economically hedge the exposure related to these derivatives at september the commercial customerrelated interest rate swaps totaled billion notional up from billion notional at december for additional information regarding interest rate swaps see note derivative instruments and hedging activities in the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report in addition to the rate ramp scenarios for net interest income changes shown above we also model immediate interest rate shock scenarios these results use historical longterm deposit rate beta assumptions that are regularly analyzed and adjusted as necessary for both rising and falling rate scenarios assuming a static balance sheet a basis point rate shock increases net interest income months by at september and at december for a basis point rate shock net interest income months increases by at september and at december the corresponding metrics for a minus basis point rate shock are and at september and december respectively compared to a minus basis point rate shock of and at september and december respectively the drivers of the change in net interest income in the rate shock scenarios include the mix shift of deposit products into shorterterm time deposits the pace of deposit repricing and assumed betas and loan prepayments these results reflect a more neutral net interest income change over months in both the up and down rate shock scenarios compared to december consistent with the rate ramp results we recognize that all assetliability models have some inherent shortcomings assetliability models require certain assumptions to be made such as prepayment rates on interestearning assets and repricing impact on nonmaturity deposits which may differ from actual experience these business assumptions are based upon our experience business plans economic and market trends and available industry data while management believes that its methodology for developing such assumptions is reasonable there can be no assurance that modeled results will be achieved furthermore the metrics are based upon the static balance sheet structure as of the valuation date and do not reflect planned growth or management actions that could be taken credit ratings our credit ratings affect the cost and availability of short and longterm funding and collateral requirements for certain derivative instruments credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by rating agencies which consider a number of factors including our financial strength performance prospects and operations as well as factors not under our control other factors that influence our credit ratings include changes to the rating agencies methodologies for our industry or certain security types the rating agencies assessment of the general operating environment for financial services companies our relative positions in the markets in which we compete our various risk exposures and risk management policies and activities pending litigation and other contingencies our reputation our liquidity position diversity of funding sources and funding costs the current and expected level and volatility of our earnings our capital position and capital management practices our corporate governance current or future regulatory and legislative initiatives and the agencies views on whether the us government would provide meaningful support to us or our subsidiaries in a crisis credit rating downgrades or negative watch warnings could negatively impact our reputation with lenders investors and other third parties which could also impair our ability to compete in certain markets or engage in certain transactions in particular holders of deposits which exceed fdic insurance limits may perceive such a downgrade or warning negatively and withdraw

to help manage enterprise risks our board of directors and senior management have identified seven major categories of risk credit risk market risk liquidity risk operational risk legal and compliance risk reputation risk and strategic risk in its oversight role of our risk management function the board of directors focuses on the strategies analyses and conclusions of management relating to identifying understanding and managing risks to optimize total shareholder value while balancing prudent business and safety and soundness considerations we support our risk management processes and business oversight through the three lines of defense and a governance structure at the board of directors and management levels the lines of defense model consists of first line of defense consists of our businesses and enterprise support areas that engage in risktaking activities and are principally responsible for owning and managing the daytoday risktaking activities in accordance with the risk frameworks second line of defense consists of risk management and compliance departments responsible for developing risk frameworks overseeing risktaking activities and identifying assessing monitoring and reporting on enterprise aggregate risks third line of defense is internal audit and provides independent assurance on the effectiveness of controls and risk management practices across our first and second lines of defense our board of directors is responsible for the oversight of management on behalf of our stockholders the board of directors has assistance in carrying out its duties and may delegate authority through the following standing board committees audit committee provides oversight of our internal and external audit processes in addition monitors the integrity of

monitoring and reporting on enterprisewide risks the risk committee and rmc are supported by other risk management committees including credit risk committees operational risk committee compliance risk committee and alco risk appetite is an integral element of our enterprise risk management framework and of our business and capital planning processes through our board risk committee and risk management council we use our risk appetite processes to promote appropriate alignment of risk capital and performance tactics while also considering risk capacity and appetite constraints from both financial and nonfinancial risks the board of directors adopted an enterprise risk appetite that defines acceptable risk limits under which we seek to operate in pursuit of optimizing returns as such we monitor a series of key risk indicators for various business lines and operation units to measure performance alignment with our stated risk appetite our topdown risk appetite process serves as a limit for undue risktaking for bottomup planning from our various business functions our board risk committee in collaboration with our risk management council approves our risk appetite on an annual basis or more frequently as needed to reflect changes in the risk regulatory economic and strategic plan environments with the goal of ensuring that our risk appetite remains consistent with our strategic plans and business operations regulatory environment and our shareholders expectations our enterprise risk management framework provides the practices to identify assess control and monitor and report on risk across the organization reports relating to our risk appetite and strategic plans and our ongoing monitoring thereof and our aggregate risk profile are regularly presented to our
