policies is included in the mda section of our annual report on form 10k filed with the sec on february under the heading application of critical accounting policies there have been no significant changes in critical accounting policies or the assumptions and judgments utilized in applying these policies since december use of nongaap financial measures and key performance indicators to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with gaap we use certain nongaap financial measures such as operating net income available to common stockholders operating earnings per diluted common share return on average tangible common equity operating return on average tangible common equity return on average tangible assets tangible book value per common share the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets operating noninterest expense efficiency ratio and net interest margin fte to provide information useful to investors in understanding our operating performance and trends and to facilitate comparisons with the performance of our peers management uses these measures internally to assess and better understand our underlying business performance and trends related to core business activities the nongaap financial measures and key performance indicators we use may differ from the nongaap financial measures and key performance indicators other financial institutions use to assess their performance and trends these nongaap financial measures should be viewed as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for or superior to our reported results prepared in accordance with gaap when nongaap financial measures are disclosed the secs regulation g requires i the presentation of the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap and ii a reconciliation of the differences between the nongaap financial measure presented and the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap reconciliations of nongaap operating measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures are included later in this report under the heading reconciliations of nongaap financial measures and key performance indicators to gaap management believes items such as merger expenses preferred deemed dividend at redemption fdic special assessment loss on indirect auto loan sale and branch consolidation costs are not organic to run our operations and facilities these items are considered significant items impacting earnings as they are deemed to be outside of ordinary banking activities these costs are specific to each individual transaction and may vary significantly based on the size and complexity of the transaction to facilitate peer comparisons of net interest margin and efficiency ratio we use net interest income on a taxableequivalent basis in calculating net interest margin by increasing the interest income earned on taxexempt assets loans and investments to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments this adjustment is not permitted under gaap taxableequivalent amounts for and were calculated

losses on loans and leases the cecl model takes into consideration the expected credit losses over the life of the loan at the time the loan is originated the model used to calculate the acl is dependent on the portfolio composition and credit quality as well as historical experience current conditions and forecasts of economic conditions and interest rates specifically the following considerations are incorporated into the acl calculation a thirdparty macroeconomic forecast scenario a 24month rs forecast period for macroeconomic factors with a reversion to the historical mean on a straightline basis over a 12month period and the historical throughthecycle default mean calculated using an expanded period to include a prior recessionary period at march and december we utilized a thirdparty consensus macroeconomic forecast reflecting the current and projected macroeconomic environment for our acl calculation at march the macroeconomic variables that we utilized included but were not limited to i the purchase only housing price index which increases over our rs forecast period ii a commercial real estate price index which increases over our rs forecast period iii sp volatility which increases in and decreases in and iv personal and business bankruptcies which increase steadily over the rs forecast period but average below historical throughthecycle period

fdic or collateralized capital resources and regulatory matters our capital position depends in part on the access to and cost of funding for new business initiatives the ability to engage in expanded business activities the ability to pay dividends and the level and nature of regulatory oversight the assessment of capital adequacy depends on a number of factors such as expected organic growth in the consolidated balance sheet asset quality liquidity earnings performance and sustainability changing competitive conditions regulatory changes or actions and economic forces we seek to maintain a strong capital base to support our growth and expansion activities to provide stability to current operations and to promote public confidence we have an effective shelf registration statement filed

for repurchase any repurchases will be made from time to time on the open market at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions the purchases will be funded from available working capital there is no guarantee as to the exact number of shares that will be repurchased and we may discontinue purchases at any time the inflation reduction act of includes a excise tax on stock repurchases beginning january on february we redeemed all our series e fixed rate floating rate noncumulative perpetual preferred stock in the amount of million the preferred stock is no longer outstanding and dividends will no longer accrue on such securities capital management is a continuous process with capital plans and stress testing for fnb and fnbpa updated at least annually these capital plans include assessing the adequacy of expected capital levels assuming various scenarios by projecting capital needs for a forecast period of years beyond the current year from time to time we issue shares initially acquired by us as treasury stock under our various benefit plans we may issue additional preferred or common stock to maintain our wellcapitalized status fnb and fnbpa are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies quantitative measures established by regulators to ensure capital adequacy require fnb and fnbpa to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total tier and cet1 capital as defined in the regulations to riskweighted assets as defined and of leverage ratio as defined failure to meet minimum capital requirements could lead to initiation of certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could have a direct material effect on our consolidated financial statements dividends and future business and corporate strategies under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action fnb and fnbpa must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets liabilities and certain offbalance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices fnbs and fnbpas capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components risk weightings and other factors at march the capital levels of both fnb and fnbpa exceeded all regulatory capital requirements and their regulatory capital ratios were above the minimum levels required to be considered wellcapitalized for regulatory purposes in december the frb and other us banking agencies approved a rule to address the impact of cecl on regulatory capital by allowing bank holding companies bhcs and banks including fnb the option to phase in the dayone impact of cecl over a threeyear period in march the frb and other us banking agencies issued a final rule that became effective on march and provides bhcs and banks with an alternative option to temporarily delay the impact of cecl relative to the incurred loss methodology for the acl on regulatory capital we have elected this alternative option instead of the one described in the december rule as a result under the final rule we delayed recognizing the estimated impact of cecl on regulatory capital until after a twoyear deferral period which for us extended through december beginning on january we were required to phase in of the previously deferred capital impact of cecl with an additional to be phased in at the beginning of each subsequent year until fully phased in by the first quarter of under the final rule the estimated impact of cecl on regulatory capital that we will defer and later phase in is calculated as the entire dayone impact at adoption plus of the subsequent change in the acl during the twoyear deferral period as of march the total deferred impact on cet1 capital related to our adoption of cecl was approximately million or basis points which will be eliminated in in this unprecedented economic and uncertain environment we frequently run stress tests for a variety of economic situations including severely adverse scenarios that have economic conditions like the current conditions under these scenarios the results of these stress tests indicate that our regulatory capital ratios would remain above the regulatory requirements and we would be able to maintain

oversight creating a resolution authority for institutions determined to be systemically important mandating higher capital and liquidity requirements requiring banks to pay increased fees to regulatory agencies and containing numerous other provisions aimed at strengthening the sound operation of the financial services sector that significantly change the system of regulatory oversight as described in more detail under part i item business government supervision and regulation included in our annual report on form 10k as filed with the sec on february liquidity our primary liquidity management goal is to satisfy the cash flow requirements of customers and the operating cash needs of fnb with costeffective funding our board of directors has established an assetliability management policy to guide management in achieving and maintaining earnings performance consistent with longterm goals while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate risk a wellcapitalized balance sheet and appropriate levels of liquidity our board of directors has also established liquidity and contingency funding policies to guide management in addressing the ability to identify measure monitor and control both normal and stressed liquidity conditions these policies designate our alco as the body responsible for meeting these objectives the alco which is comprised of members of executive management reviews liquidity on a continuous basis and approves significant changes in strategies that affect balance sheet or cash flow positions liquidity is centrally managed daily by our treasury department parent company liquidity the parent companys funding requirements primarily consist of shareholder dividends debt service income taxes operating expenses funding of nonbank subsidiaries and

the consolidated tax returns fees for services provided to subsidiaries and the issuance of debt instruments the dividends received from the bank and other direct subsidiaries may be impacted by the parents or its subsidiaries capital and liquidity needs statutory laws and regulations corporate policies contractual restrictions profitability and other factors in addition through one of our

needs during the third quarter of we completed a senior debt offering for million in net proceeds a portion of these proceeds was used to retire debt that matured in february for additional information see note borrowings in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this report the parent companys cash position at march was million down million from yearend primarily due to

environment bank liquidity banklevel liquidity sources from assets include payments from loans and investments as well as the ability to securitize pledge or sell loans investment securities and other assets liquidity sources from liabilities are generated primarily through the banking offices of fnbpa in the form of deposits and customer repurchase agreements the bank also has access to reliable and costeffective wholesale sources of liquidity short and longterm funds are available for use to help fund normal business operations and unused credit availability can be utilized to serve as contingency funding if faced with a liquidity crisis over time our liquidity position has been positively impacted by fnbpas ability to generate growth in relationshipbased accounts organic growth in lowcost transaction deposits was complemented by managements continued strategy of deposit gathering efforts focused on attracting new customer relationships across our geographic footprint and deepening relationships with existing customers in part through internal lead generation efforts leveraging data analytics capabilities consistent with industry trends we have experienced a shift in deposits from noninterestbearing deposits into certificates of deposit cds the march banking disruption caused an acceleration of this shift at march approximately of our deposits were insured by the fdic or collateralized stable with december noninterestbearing demand deposits decreased million compared to december interestbearing demand deposits decreased million and savings account balances decreased million while time deposits increased million compared to december as customers continue to migrate deposits into higheryielding deposit products the mix of noninterestbearing deposits to

unused borrowing capacity that could cover times the uninsured deposit and noncollateralized deposit balances as of march a portion of this capacity includes the frbs discount window we have no borrowings under this facility additional sources of unused wholesale credit availability for fnbpa include the ability to borrow from the fhlb correspondent bank lines and access to other channels in

liabilities over future time intervals management calculates this ratio at least quarterly and it is reviewed regularly by alco management monitors the size of the liquidity gaps so that sources and uses of funds are reasonably matched in the normal course of business and in relation to implied forward rate expectations a reasonably matched position lays a better foundation for dealing with additional funding needs during a potential liquidity crisis a positive gap position means that more assets are expected to mature over the next months than liabilities the allocation of nonmaturity deposits and customer repurchase agreements to the twelvemonth categories is based on the estimated lives of each product table  in millions within month months months months total year assets loans investments liabilities nonmaturity deposits time deposits borrowings period gap assets liabilities cumulative gap cumulative gap to total assets the twelvemonth cumulative gap to total assets ratio was as of march compared to as of december the change in the twelvemonth cumulative gap to total assets was primarily related to the active management of deposit pricing across the deposit product maturity tenors which reduced our asset sensitivity in addition the alco regularly monitors various liquidity ratios stress scenarios of our liquidity position and assumptions considering market disruptions lending demand deposit behavior and funding availability the stress scenarios forecast that adequate funding will be available even under severe conditions management believes we have sufficient liquidity available to meet our normal operating and contingency funding cash needs market risk market risk refers to potential losses arising predominately from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices interest rate risk is comprised of repricing risk basis risk yield curve risk and options risk we are primarily exposed to interest rate risk inherent in our lending and deposittaking activities as a financial intermediary to succeed in this capacity we offer an extensive variety of financial products to meet the diverse needs of our customers these products sometimes contribute to interest rate risk for us when product groups do not complement one another for example depositors may want shortterm deposits while borrowers may desire longterm loans changes in market interest rates may result in changes in the fair value of our financial instruments cash flows and net interest income subject to its ongoing oversight the board of directors has given alco the responsibility for market risk management which involves devising policy guidelines risk measures and limits and managing the amount of interest rate risk and its effect on net interest income and capital we use derivative financial instruments for interest rate risk management purposes and not for trading or speculative purposes we use an assetliability model to measure our interest rate risk interest rate risk measures we utilize include earnings simulation eve and gap analysis gap analysis and eve are static measures that do not incorporate assumptions regarding future business gap analysis while a helpful diagnostic tool displays cash flows for only a single rate environment eves longterm horizon helps identify changes in optionality and longerterm positions however eves liquidation perspective does not translate into the earningsbased measures that are the focus of managing and valuing a going concern net interest income simulations explicitly measure the exposure to earnings from changes in market rates of interest in these simulations our current financial position is combined with assumptions regarding future business activities to calculate net interest income under various hypothetical rate scenarios the alco regularly reviews earnings simulations over multiple years under various interest rate scenarios reviewing these various measures provides us with a comprehensive view of our interest rate risk profile which provides the basis for balance sheet management strategies the following repricing gap analysis as of march compares the difference between the amount of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities subject to repricing over a period of time the allocation of nonmaturity deposits and customer repurchase agreements to the onemonth maturity category below is based on the estimated sensitivity of each product to changes in market rates for example if a products rate is estimated to increase by as much as the market rates then of the account balance was placed in this category management utilizes the repricing gap analysis as a diagnostic tool in managing net interest income and eve risk measures table  in millions within month months months months total year assets loans investments liabilities nonmaturity deposits time deposits borrowings offbalance sheet period gap assets liabilities offbalance sheet cumulative gap cumulative gap to earning assets the twelvemonth cumulative repricing gap to total assets was and as of march and december respectively the positive cumulative gap positions indicate that we have a greater amount of repricing earning assets than repricing interestbearing liabilities over the subsequent twelve months the change in the cumulative repricing gap at march compared to december is primarily related to customers moving into shorterterm time deposits in addition to the repricing gap analysis above we model rate scenarios which move all rates gradually over twelve months rate ramps we also model rate scenarios which move all rates in an immediate and parallel fashion rate shocks and model scenarios that gradually change the shape of the yield curve using a static balance sheet structure and utilizing net interest income simulations the following table presents an analysis of the potential sensitivity of our net interest income to changes in interest rates using rate ramps and the sensitivity of eve using rate shocks the variance percentages represent the change between the net interest income and eve calculated under the particular rate scenario compared to the net interest income and eve that was calculated assuming market rates as of march the calculated results do not reflect managements potential actions table

points basis points basis points basis points management continues to be proactive in managing our interest rate risk irr position with the intention to manage to a more neutral position given the current market expectations for future interest rates during the first quarter of management adjusted the irr position by managing cash balances slightly extending the duration of the investment securities portfolio originating adjustable rate mortgage loans with longerduration fixed periods strategically meeting our customers preferences for higher yielding deposit products in particular with shorterterm time deposits and utilizing borrowings of variable rates and varying maturities as a result the net interest income change over months shown above in both the up and down rate ramp scenarios is closer to neutral compared to december we also utilize derivatives to manage the irr position and we continue to make use of interest rate swaps to commercial borrowers commercial swaps to manage our irr position as the commercial swaps effectively increase our level of adjustablerate loans total variable and adjustablerate loans were of total net loans and leases as of march and as of december as of march the commercial swaps totaled billion of notional principal down from billion at december furthermore we regularly sell longterm fixedrate residential mortgages in the secondary market and have been successful in the origination of consumer and commercial loans with shortterm repricing characteristics for additional information regarding interest rate swaps see note derivative instruments and hedging activities in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this report in addition to the rate ramp scenarios for net interest income changes shown above we also model immediate interest rate shock scenarios these results use historical longterm deposit rate beta assumptions that are regularly analyzed and adjusted as necessary for both rising and falling rate scenarios assuming a static balance sheet a basis point rate shock increases net interest income months by at march and at december for a basis point rate shock net interest income months increases by at march and at december the corresponding metrics for a minus basis point rate shock are and at march and december respectively the drivers of the change in net interest income in the rate shock scenarios include the mix shift of deposit products into shorterterm time deposits the pace of deposit repricing and assumed betas and loan prepayments these results reflect a more neutral net interest income change over months in both the up and down rate shock scenarios compared to december consistent with the rate ramp results the fomc increased the federal funds rate basis points in the first seven months of fortyeight percent of our net loans and leases reprice within the next three months and are indexed to shortterm sofr prime and other indices which benefit from higher rates our cash position has also been a significant factor in our asset sensitivity metrics there are multiple factors that influence our interest rate risk position and impact net interest income these include external factors such as the shape of the yield curve the competitive landscape and expectations regarding future interest rates as well as internal factors regarding product offerings product mix and pricing of loans and deposits we recognize that all assetliability models have some inherent shortcomings assetliability models require certain assumptions to be made such as prepayment rates on interestearning assets and repricing impact on nonmaturity deposits which may differ from actual experience these business assumptions are based upon our experience business plans economic and market trends and available industry data while management believes that its methodology for developing such assumptions is reasonable there can be no assurance that modeled results will be achieved furthermore the metrics are based upon the balance sheet structure as of the valuation date and do not reflect planned growth or management actions that could be taken credit ratings our credit ratings affect the cost and availability of short and longterm funding and collateral requirements for certain derivative instruments credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by rating agencies which consider a number of factors including our financial strength performance prospects and operations as well as factors not under our control other factors that influence our credit ratings include changes to the rating agencies methodologies for our industry or certain security types the rating agencies assessment of the general operating environment for financial services companies our relative positions in the markets in which we compete our various risk exposures and risk management policies and activities pending litigation and other contingencies our reputation our liquidity position diversity of funding sources and funding costs the current and expected level and volatility of our earnings our capital position and capital management practices our corporate governance current or future regulatory and legislative initiatives and the agencies views on whether the us government would provide meaningful support to us or our subsidiaries in a crisis credit rating downgrades or negative watch warnings could negatively impact our reputation with lenders investors and other third parties which could also impair our ability to compete in certain markets or engage in certain transactions in particular holders of deposits which exceed fdic insurance limits may perceive such a downgrade or warning negatively and withdraw all or a portion of such deposits the

of risk in every business decision transaction and activity accordingly we have designed an enterprise risk management framework and risk management practices to help manage enterprise risks our board of directors and senior management have identified seven major categories of risk credit risk market risk liquidity risk operational risk legal and compliance risk reputation risk and strategic risk in its oversight role of our risk management function the board of directors focuses on the strategies analyses and conclusions of management relating to identifying understanding and managing risks to optimize total shareholder value while balancing prudent business and safety and soundness considerations we support our risk management processes and business oversight through the three lines of defense and a governance structure at the board of directors and management levels the lines of defense model consists of first line of defense consists of our businesses and enterprise support areas that generate risk and are principally responsible for owning and managing the daytoday risktaking activities in accordance with the risk frameworks second line of defense consists of risk management and compliance departments responsible for developing risk frameworks overseeing risktaking activities and identifying assessing monitoring and reporting on enterprise aggregate risks third line of defense is internal audit and provides independent assurance on the effectiveness of controls and risk management practices across our first and second lines of defense our board of directors is responsible for the oversight of management on behalf of our stockholders the board of directors has assistance in carrying out its duties and may delegate authority through the following standing board committees audit committee provides oversight of our internal and external audit processes in addition monitors the integrity of the consolidated financial statements internal controls over financial reporting qualifications and independence of our audit function nominating and corporate governance committee responsible for selecting and recommending nominees for election to the fnb and fnbpa boards of directors compensation committee reviews performance and compensation of senior management and reviews and implements compensation and benefit matters having corporatewide significance

of our risk management and assessment processes including the review and approval of risk management policies procedures and practices to identify assess monitor and report material risks credit fair lending and cra committee responsible for providing oversight of credit and lending strategies and objectives the risk committee serves as the primary point of contact between our board of directors and the risk management council rmc which is the senior management level committee responsible for identifying assessing monitoring and reporting on enterprisewide risks the risk committee and rmc are supported by other risk management committees including credit risk committees operational risk committee compliance risk committee and alco risk appetite is an integral element of our enterprise risk management framework and of our business and capital planning processes through our board risk committee and risk management council we use our risk appetite processes to promote appropriate alignment of risk capital and performance tactics while also considering risk capacity and appetite constraints from both financial and nonfinancial risks the board of directors adopted an enterprise risk appetite that defines acceptable risk limits under which we seek to operate in pursuit of optimizing returns as such we monitor a series of key risk indicators for various business lines and operation units to measure performance alignment with our stated risk appetite our topdown risk appetite process serves as a limit for undue risktaking for bottomup planning from our various business functions our board risk committee in collaboration with our risk management council approves our risk appetite on an annual basis or more frequently as needed to reflect changes in the risk regulatory economic and strategic plan environments with the goal of ensuring that our risk appetite remains consistent with our strategic plans and business operations regulatory environment and our shareholders expectations our enterprise risk management framework provides the practices to identify assess control and monitor and report on risk across the organization reports relating to our risk appetite and strategic plans and our ongoing monitoring thereof and our aggregate risk profile are regularly presented to our various management level risk oversight and planning committees and periodically reported up through our board risk committee the board of directors believes that our enterprisewide risk management process is effective and enables the board of directors to assess the quality of the information they receive understand the businesses investments and financial accounting legal regulatory and strategic considerations and the risks that fnb faces oversee and assess how senior
