pandemic could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and the ultimate impacts of the pandemic on our business financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments and other factors that are highly uncertain and will be impacted by the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic the ongoing covid19 global and national health emergency has caused significant disruption in the international and us economies and financial markets and could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the spread of covid19 has caused illness quarantines cancellation of events and travel business and school shutdowns reduction in business activity and financial transactions supply chain interruptions and overall economic and financial market instability in response to the covid19 pandemic the governments of the states in which we have branch offices and of most other states have taken preventative or protective actions such as imposing restrictions on travel and business operations advising or requiring individuals to limit or forego their time outside of their homes and ordering temporary closures of businesses that have been deemed to be nonessential these restrictions and other consequences of the pandemic have resulted in significant adverse effects for many different types of businesses and have resulted in a significant number of layoffs and furloughs of employees nationwide and in the regions in which we operate the ultimate effects of covid19 on the broader economy and the markets that we serve are not known nor is the ultimate length of the restrictions described above and any accompanying effects moreover the fomc has taken action to lower the federal funds rate which may negatively affect our interest income and therefore earnings financial condition and results of operation additional impacts of covid19 on our business could be widespread and material and may include or exacerbate among other consequences the following employees including key executives contracting covid19 reductions in our operating effectiveness as our employees work from home a work stoppage forced quarantine or other interruption of our business unavailability of key personnel necessary to conduct our business activities effects on key employees including operational management personnel and those charged with preparing monitoring and evaluating our financial reporting and internal controls sustained longerterm closures of our branch lobbies or the offices of our customers declines in demand for loans and other banking services and products reduced consumer spending due to both job losses and other effects attributable to covid19 unprecedented volatility in us financial markets volatile performance of our investment securities portfolio decline in the credit quality of our loan portfolio owing to the effects of covid19 in the markets we serve leading to a need to increase our acl and the potential for higher loan losses declines in value of collateral for loans including real estate collateral declines in the net worth and liquidity of borrowers and loan guarantors impairing their ability to honor commitments to us and declines in demand resulting from businesses being deemed to be nonessential by governments in the markets we serve and from nonessential and essential businesses suffering adverse effects from reduced levels of economic activity in our markets these factors together or in combination with other events or occurrences that are not yet known or anticipated may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations the ongoing covid19 pandemic has resulted in meaningfully lower stock prices for many companies including the financial services sector as well as the trading prices for many other securities the further spread of the covid19 outbreak as well as ongoing or new governmental regulatory and private sector responses to the pandemic may materially disrupt banking and other economic activity generally and in the geographic areas in which we operate this could result in further decline in demand for our banking products and services and could negatively impact among other things our liquidity regulatory capital and our growth strategy any one or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we are taking precautions to protect the safety and wellbeing of our employees and customers however no assurance can be given that the steps being taken will be adequate or deemed to be appropriate nor can we predict the level of disruption which will occur to our employees ability to provide customer support and service if we are unable to recover from a business disruption on a timely basis our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected we may also incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions which could further adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations as a participating lender in the sba ppp we are subject to additional risks of litigation from fnbpas clients or other parties regarding fnbpas processing of loans for the ppp and risks that the sba may not fund some or all ppp loan guaranties on march president trump signed the cares act which included a billion loan program administered through the sba referred to as the ppp under the ppp small businesses and other entities and individuals can apply for loans from existing sba lenders and other approved regulated lenders that enroll in the program subject to numerous limitations and eligibility criteria fnbpa is participating as a lender in the ppp the ppp opened on april however because of the short timeframe between the passing of the cares act and the opening of the ppp there is some ambiguity in the laws rules and guidance regarding the operation of the ppp along with continually evolving nature of sba the rules interpretations and guidelines concerning this program exposes us to risks relating to noncompliance with the ppp on or about april the sba notified lenders that the billion earmarked for the ppp was exhausted congress has approved additional funding for the ppp and president trump signed the new legislation on april since the opening of the ppp several other larger banks have been subject to litigation regarding the process and procedures that such banks used in processing applications for the ppp we may be exposed to the risk of litigation from both clients and nonclients that approached fnbpa regarding ppp loans regarding its process and procedures used in processing applications for the ppp if any such litigation is filed against the us and is not resolved in a manner favorable to us it may result in significant financial liability or adversely affect our reputation in addition litigation can be costly regardless of outcome any financial liability litigation costs or reputational damage caused by ppp related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations fnbpa also has credit risk on ppp loans if a determination is made by the sba that there is a deficiency in the manner in which the loan was originated underwritten certified by the borrower funded or serviced by fnbpa such as an issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive a ppp loan which may or may not be related to the ambiguity in the laws rules and guidance regarding the operation of the ppp in the event of a loss resulting from a default on a ppp loan and a determination by the sba that there was a deficiency in the manner in which the ppp loan was originated certified by the borrower funded or serviced by fnbpa the sba may deny its liability under the guaranty reduce the amount of the guaranty or if it has already paid under the guaranty seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from us declines in the fair value of our reporting units could result in a goodwill impairment charge and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations covid19 impacts to worldwide economic conditions and the resulting adverse effects to stock market capitalization could negatively impact the carrying amount of goodwill assets goodwill is periodically tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount if the fair value is greater than the carrying amount then the reporting units goodwill is deemed not to be impaired the fair value of a reporting unit is impacted by the reporting units expected financial performance and susceptibility to adverse economic regulatory and legislative changes the most significant assumptions affecting our goodwill impairment evaluation are variables including the market price of our common stock projections of earnings the discount rates used in the income approach to fair value and the control premium above our current stock price that an acquirer would pay to obtain control of the company while these factors provide some relative market information about the estimated fair value of the reporting units they are not individually determinative and need to be evaluated in the context of the current economic environment however significant and sustained declines in the companys market capitalization or other factors could be an indication of potential goodwill impairment fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions estimates and market factors if any estimates market factors or assumptions change in the future these amounts are susceptible to impairments for additional discussion related to goodwill refer to note goodwill
