materially from those expressed or implied as a result of these risks and uncertainties including but not limited to the risk factors and other uncertainties described under item risk factors and risk management sections in this annual report on s with the sec which will be available on our corporate website at httpswwwfnbonlinecomaboutusinvestorrelationsshareholderservices we have included our web address as an inactive textual reference only information on our website is not part of this report application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap application of these principles requires management to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes these estimates assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements accordingly as this information changes the consolidated financial statements could reflect different estimates assumptions and judgments certain policies inherently are based to a greater extent on estimates assumptions and judgments of management and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported the most significant accounting policies followed by fnb are presented in note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements which is included in item of this report these policies along with the disclosures presented in the notes to consolidated financial statements provide information on how we value significant assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements how we determine those values and how we record transactions in the consolidated financial statements management views critical accounting policies to be those which are highly dependent on subjective or complex judgments estimates and assumptions and where changes in those estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements management currently views the determination of the allowance for credit losses accounting for loans acquired in a business combination fair value of financial instruments goodwill and other intangible assets income taxes and deferred tax assets and litigation reserves to be critical accounting policies allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses addresses credit losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio and in unfunded loan commitments and standby letters of credit at the balance sheet date and is presented as a reserve against loans and other liabilities respectively on the consolidated balance sheets managements assessment of the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses considers individual impaired loans pools of homogeneous loans with similar risk characteristics and other risk factors concerning the economic environment these analyses involve judgment in estimating the amount of loss associated with specific impaired loans including estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows current fair value of the underlying collateral and other qualitative risk factors that may affect the loan all of which may be susceptible to significant change loans with similar risk characteristics are categorized into pools based on loan type and by internal risk rating for commercial loans or payment performance and credit score for consumer loans there is judgment involved in setting internal commercial risk ratings including an evaluation of the borrowers current financial condition and ability to repay the loan transition matrices are generated on a monthly basis to determine probabilities of default while historical loss experience is used to generate loss given default results for the pools inherent but undetected losses may arise due to uncertainties in economic conditions delays in obtaining information including unfavorable information about a borrowers financial condition the difficulty in identifying triggering events that correlate to subsequent loss rates and risk factors that have not yet manifested themselves in loss allocation factors uncertainty surrounding the strength and timing of economic cycles also affects estimates of loss the historical loss experience used in the transition matrices and historical loss experience analysis may not be representative of actual unrealized losses inherent in the portfolio management evaluates the impact of various qualitative factors which pose additional risks that may not be adequately addressed in the analyses described above expected loss rates for each loan category may be adjusted for levels of and trends in loan volumes net chargeoffs delinquency and nonperforming loans in addition management takes into consideration the impact of changes to lending policies the experience and depth of lending management and staff the results of internal loan reviews concentrations of credit competition legal and regulatory risk market uncertainty and collateral illiquidity national and local economic trends or any other common risk factor that might affect loss experience across one or more components of the portfolio economic factors influencing managements estimate of allowance for credit losses include but are not limited to uncertainty of the labor markets industrial presence commercial real estate activity and residential real estate values the determination of this qualitative component of the allowance for credit losses involves a high degree of subjectivity and is particularly dependent on the judgment of management to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates additional provisions for credit losses could be required that may affect our earnings or financial position in future periods the provision for credit losses section in the results of operations includes a discussion of the factors affecting changes in the allowance for credit losses during the current period see note summary of significant accounting policies and note loans and leases in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on the allowance for credit losses accounting for loans acquired in a business combination all loans acquired in a business combination are initially measured at fair value at the date of acquisition the fair value of loans acquired in a business combination is based on a discounted cash flow methodology that involves assumptions and judgments as to credit risk default rates loss severity collateral values discount rates prepayment speeds prepayment risk and liquidity risk the measurement of fair value on loans acquired in a business combination prohibits the carryover or establishment of an allowance for loan losses at acquisition date loans acquired in a business combination are considered impaired if there is evidence of credit deterioration since origination and if it is probable at time of acquisition that all contractually required payments will not be collected the present value of any decreases in expected cash flows after the acquisition date will generally result in an impairment charge recorded as a provision for credit losses for acquired nonimpaired loans including revolving loans lines of credit and credit card loans and leases that are excluded from acquired impaired loan accounting the difference between the acquisition date fair value and the contractual amounts due at the acquisition date represents the fair value adjustment fair value adjustments may be discounts or premiums to a loans cost basis and are accreted or amortized to interest income over the loans remaining life using the level yield method subsequent to the acquisition date the methods utilized to estimate the required allowance for credit losses for these loans is similar to originated loans however we record a provision for credit losses only when the required allowance exceeds the remaining fair value adjustment these estimates are inherently subjective and can result in significant changes in the cash flow estimates over the life of the loan to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates the outcome may affect our earnings or financial position in future periods see note summary of significant accounting policies and note loans and leases in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of accounting for loans acquired in a business combination fair value of financial instruments we use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain financial assets and liabilities and determine fair value disclosures additionally from time to time we may be required to record at fair value other assets on a nonrecurring basis such as loans held for sale certain impaired loans oreo and certain other assets the accounting guidance for fair value measurements includes a threelevel hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used for measurement are observable or unobservable judgment is required to determine which level of the threelevel hierarchy certain assets or liabilities measured at fair value are classified fair value represents the price that would be received to sell a financial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date we use significant and complex estimates assumptions and judgments when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at or adjusted to reflect fair value where available fair value and information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets or liabilities is based on either quoted market prices or are provided by independent thirdparty sources including appraisers and valuation specialists when such thirdparty information is not available we may estimate fair value by using cash flow and other financial modeling techniques our assumptions about what a market participant would use in pricing an asset or liability is developed based on the best information available in the circumstances these estimates are inherently subjective and can result in significant changes in the fair value estimates over the life of the asset or liability assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility see note summary of significant accounting policies and note fair value measurements in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of accounting for financial instruments goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of acquisitions we have recorded goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheets goodwill represents the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of net assets including identifiable intangible assets at the acquisition date our recorded goodwill relates to value inherent in our community banking wealth management and insurance segments the value of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles is dependent upon our ability to provide high quality costeffective services in the face of competition as such these values are supported ultimately by revenue that is driven by the volume of business transacted a decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth or our inability to deliver costeffective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment in value which could result in additional expense and adversely impact earnings in future periods goodwill and other intangibles are subject to impairment testing at the reporting unit level which must be conducted at least annually we perform impairment testing during the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if impairment indicators exist we also continue to monitor other intangibles for impairment and to evaluate carrying amounts as necessary determining fair values of each reporting unit of its individual assets and liabilities and also of other identifiable intangible assets requires considering market information that is publicly available as well as the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge inputs used in determining fair values where significant estimates and assumptions are necessary include discounted cash flow calculations market comparisons and recent transactions projected future cash flows discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows longterm growth rates and determination and evaluation of appropriate market comparables see note summary of significant accounting policies and note goodwill and other intangible assets in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets income taxes and deferred tax assets we are subject to the income tax laws of federal state and other taxing jurisdictions where we conduct business the laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and various taxing authorities in determining the provision for income taxes management must make judgments and estimates about the application of these inherently complex tax statutes related regulations and case law in the process of preparing our tax returns management attempts to make reasonable interpretations of the tax laws these interpretations are subject to challenge by the taxing authorities or based on managements ongoing assessment of the facts and evolving case law we determine deferred income taxes using the balance sheet method under this method the net dta or dtl is based on the tax effects of the differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities and recognizes the effect of enacted changes in tax rates and laws in the period in which they occur that effect would be included in income in the reporting period that includes the enactment date of the change see the results of operations income taxes section later in this mda for further taxrelated discussion on a quarterly basis management assesses the reasonableness of our effective tax rate based on managements current best estimate of pretax earnings and the applicable taxes for the full year dtas and dtls are assessed on an annual basis or sooner if business events or circumstances warrant deferred income taxes represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and from operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies we establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize a benefit from our dtas or when future deductibility is uncertain periodically the valuation allowance is reviewed and adjusted based on managements assessments of realizable dtas see note summary of significant accounting policies and note income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of accounting for income taxes litigation reserves the corporation is involved in various pending and threatened legal proceedings in which claims for monetary damages and other relief are asserted these claims result from ordinary business activities relating to our current andor former operations although the ultimate outcome for any asserted claim cannot be predicted with certainty we believe that the corporation has valid defenses for all asserted claims in accordance with applicable accounting guidance when a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable we in conjunction with internal and outside counsel handling the matter record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss we continue to monitor the matter for further developments that could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has previously been established litigation expense represents a key area of judgment and is subject to uncertainty and factors outside of our control significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our financial liabilities may ultimately be more or less than the current estimate see our policy on establishing accruals for litigation in note commitments credit risk and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements recent accounting pronouncements and developments note new accounting standards in the notes to consolidated financial statements which is included in item of this report discusses new accounting pronouncements adopted by us in and the expected impact of accounting pronouncements recently issued but not yet required to be adopted use of nongaap financial measures and key performance indicators to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with gaap we use certain nongaap financial measures such as operating net income available to common stockholders operating earnings per diluted common share return on average tangible common equity return on average tangible assets tangible book value per common share the ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets efficiency ratio and net interest margin fte to provide information useful to investors in understanding our operating performance and trends and to facilitate comparisons with the performance of our peers management uses these measures internally to assess and better understand our underlying business performance and trends related to core business activities the nongaap financial measures and key performance indicators we use may differ from the nongaap financial measures and key performance indicators other financial institutions use to assess their performance and trends these nongaap financial measures should be viewed as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for or superior to our reported results prepared in accordance with gaap when nongaap financial measures are disclosed the secs regulation g requires i the presentation of the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap and ii a reconciliation of the differences between the nongaap financial measure presented and the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap reconciliations of nongaap operating measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures are included later in this report under the heading reconciliations of nongaap financial measures and key performance indicators to gaap management believes charges such as merger expenses branch consolidation costs certain service charge refunds and special onetime 401k contributions related to tax reform are not organic costs to run our operations and facilities these charges are considered significant items impacting earnings as they are deemed to be outside of ordinary banking activities the merger expenses and branch consolidation charges principally represent expenses to satisfy contractual obligations of the acquired entity or closed branch without any useful ongoing benefit to us these costs are specific to each individual transaction and may vary significantly based on the size and complexity of the transaction similarly gains derived from the sale of a business are not organic to our operations to provide more meaningful comparisons of net interest margin and efficiency ratio we use net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis in calculating net interest margin by increasing the interest income earned on taxexempt assets loans and investments to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments this adjustment is not permitted under gaap

assetliability committee as the body responsible for meeting these objectives the alco which is comprised of members of executive management reviews liquidity on a continuous basis and approves significant changes in strategies that affect balance sheet or cash flow positions liquidity is centrally managed daily by our treasury department the principal sources of the parent companys liquidity are its strong existing cash resources plus dividends it receives from its subsidiaries these dividends may be impacted by the parents or its subsidiaries capital needs statutory laws and regulations corporate policies contractual restrictions profitability and other factors in addition through one of our subsidiaries we regularly issue subordinated notes which are guaranteed by fnb management has utilized various strategies to ensure sufficient cash on hand is available to meet the parents funding needs during the first quarter of we completed a debt offering in which we issued

accomplished strategic objectives and were the primary factors resulting in an increase in our liquidity metrics as shown below management believes our cash levels are appropriate given the current

generates liquidity from its normal business operations liquidity sources from assets include payments from loans and investments as well as the ability to securitize pledge or sell loans investment securities and other assets liquidity sources from liabilities are generated primarily through the banking offices of fnbpa in the form of deposits fnb also has access to reliable and costeffective wholesale sources of liquidity short and longterm funds are used to help fund normal business operations and unused credit availability can be utilized to serve as contingency funding if we are faced with a liquidity crisis our liquidity position has been positively impacted by our ability to generate growth in relationshipbased accounts organic growth in lowcost transaction deposits was complemented by managements strategy of heightened deposit gathering efforts focused on attracting new customer relationships and deepening relationships with existing customers in part through internal lead generation efforts leveraging data analytics capabilities total deposits were billion at december an increase of billion or from december total noninterestbearing demand deposit accounts

availability sources that include the availability to borrow from the fhlb the frb correspondent bank lines access to brokered deposits and multiple other channels in addition to credit availability fnbpa also possesses salable unpledged government and agency securities that could be utilized to meet funding needs the alco policy minimum guideline level for salable unpledged government and agency

availability unused wholesale credit availability as a of fnbpa assets salable unpledged government and agency securities salable unpledged government and agency securities as a of fnbpa assets table end unused wholesale credit availability increased billion due to additional collateral capacity provided by loan growth and reduced usage provided by deposit growth salable unpledged government and agency securities decreased million primarily due to an increase in relationship deposits requiring collateralization another metric for measuring liquidity risk is the liquidity gap analysis the following liquidity gap analysis as of december compares the difference between our cash flows from existing earning assets and interestbearing liabilities over future time intervals management seeks to limit the size of the liquidity gaps so that sources and uses of funds are reasonably matched in the normal course of business a reasonably matched position lays a better foundation for dealing with additional funding needs during a potential liquidity crisis the twelvemonth cumulative gap to total assets ratio was and as of december and respectively management calculates this ratio at least quarterly and it is reviewed monthly by alco table table start dollars in millions within month months months months total year assets loans investments liabilities nonmaturity deposits time deposits borrowings period gap assets liabilities cumulative gap cumulative gap to total assets table end in addition the alco regularly monitors various liquidity ratios and stress scenarios of our liquidity position the stress scenarios forecast that adequate funding will be available even under severe conditions management believes we have sufficient liquidity available to meet our normal operating and contingency funding cash needs market risk market risk refers to potential losses arising predominately from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices we are primarily exposed to interest rate risk inherent in our lending and deposittaking activities as a financial intermediary to succeed in this capacity we offer an extensive variety of financial products to meet the diverse needs of our customers these products sometimes contribute to interest rate risk for us when product behaviors do not complement one another for example depositors may want shortterm deposits while borrowers may desire longterm loans changes in market interest rates may result in changes in the fair value of our financial instruments cash flows and net interest income subject to its ongoing oversight the board of directors has given alco the responsibility for market risk management which involves devising policy guidelines risk measures and limits and managing the amount of interest rate risk and its effect on net interest income and capital we use derivative financial instruments for interest rate risk management purposes and not for trading or speculative purposes interest rate risk is comprised of repricing risk basis risk yield curve risk and options risk repricing risk arises from differences in the cash flow or repricing between asset and liability portfolios basis risk arises when asset and liability portfolios are related to different market rate indexes which do not always change by the same amount yield curve risk arises when asset and liability portfolios are related to different maturities on a given yield curve when the yield curve changes shape the risk position is altered options risk arises from embedded options within asset and liability products for example certain borrowers have the option to prepay their loans which may be with or without penalty when rates fall while certain depositors can redeem their certificates of deposit early which may be with or without penalty when rates rise we use an assetliability model to measure our interest rate risk interest rate risk measures we utilize include earnings simulation eve and gap analysis gap analysis and eve are static measures that do not incorporate assumptions regarding future business gap analysis while a helpful diagnostic tool displays cash flows for only a single rate environment eves longterm horizon helps identify changes in optionality and longerterm positions however eves liquidation perspective does not translate into the earningsbased measures that are the focus of managing and valuing a going concern net interest income simulations explicitly measure the exposure to earnings from changes in market rates of interest in these simulations our current financial position is combined with assumptions regarding future business to calculate net interest income under various hypothetical rate scenarios the alco reviews earnings simulations over multiple years under various interest rate scenarios on a regular basis reviewing these various measures provides us with a comprehensive view of our interest rate risk profile which provides the basis for balance sheet management strategies the following repricing gap analysis as of december compares the difference between the amount of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities subject to repricing over a period of time management utilizes the repricing gap analysis as a diagnostic tool in managing net interest income and eve risk measures table table start dollars in millions within month months months months total year assets loans investments liabilities nonmaturity deposits time deposits borrowings offbalance sheet period gap assets liabilities offbalance sheet cumulative gap cumulative gap to assets table end the twelvemonth cumulative repricing gap to total assets was and as of december and respectively the positive cumulative gap positions indicate that we have a greater amount of repricing earning assets than repricing interestbearing liabilities over the subsequent twelve months if interest rates increase as modeled net interest income will increase and conversely if interest rates decrease as modeled net interest income will decrease the change in the cumulative repricing gap at december compared to december is primarily related to growth and changes in the mix of loans deposits and borrowings strong commercial and industrial loan growth a portion of which was swapped to adjustable rates the sale of longterm fixed rate mortgage loans and the increased cash flow from the loan and investment portfolios were partially offset by growth in and repricing of interestbearing nonmaturity deposit balances and the funding of longterm fhlb advances the funding of both fixed and adjustable longerterm borrowings was opportunistically transacted to take advantage of the lower interest rate environment and add liquidity to support loan growth the allocation of nonmaturity deposits and customer repurchase agreements to the onemonth maturity category above is based on the estimated sensitivity of each product to changes in market rates for example if a products rate is estimated to increase by as much as the market rates then of the account balance was placed in this category utilizing net interest income simulations the following net interest income metrics were calculated using rate shocks which move market rates in an immediate and parallel fashion the variance percentages represent the change between the net interest income and eve calculated under the particular rate scenario versus the net interest income and eve that was calculated assuming market rates as of december using a static balance sheet structure the measures do not reflect all of managements potential counteractions the following table presents an analysis of the potential sensitivity of our net interest income and eve to changes in interest rates using rate shocks table table start december alco limits net interest income change months basis points na basis points basis points basis points economic value of equity basis points basis points basis points basis points table end we also model rate scenarios which move all rates gradually over twelve months rate ramps and model scenarios that gradually change the shape of the yield curve assuming a static balance sheet a basis point rate ramp increases net interest income months by and at december and respectively the corresponding metrics for a basis point rate ramp are and at december and respectively our strategy is generally to manage to a neutral interest rate risk position consistent with prior years we desired to remain slightly assetsensitive during there are multiple factors that influence our interest rate risk position and impact net interest income these include external factors such as the shape of the yield curve and expectations regarding future interest rates as well as internal factors regarding product offerings product mix and pricing of loans and deposits at yearend the market consensus was expecting the fomc to increase interest rates due to a strengthening economy however citing a softening economy the fomc actually moved to lower rates twice during the third quarter and once in the fourth quarter of management utilizes various tactics to achieve our desired interest rate risk irr position in response to the change in interest rates management was proactive in addressing our irr position as mentioned earlier we were successful in growing our transaction deposits which provides funding that is less interest ratesensitive than shortterm time deposits and wholesale borrowings also we were able to lower rates on certain deposit products and shorten the term of the certificates of deposit this continues to be the focus of management on the lending side we regularly sell longterm fixedrate residential mortgages to the secondary market and have been successful in the origination of consumer and commercial loans with shortterm repricing characteristics in particular we have made use of interest rate
