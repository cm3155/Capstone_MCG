item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda represents an overview of and highlights material changes to our financial condition and consolidated results of operations at and for the three and sixmonth periods ended june and this mda should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained herein and our annual report on s with the sec which are available on our corporate website at httpswwwfnbonlinecomaboutusinvestorrelationsshareholderservices more specifically our forwardlooking statements may be subject to the evolving risks and uncertainties related to the covid19 pandemic and its macroeconomic impact and the resulting governmental business and societal responses to it we have included our web address as an inactive textual reference only information on our website is not part of this report application of critical accounting policies a description of our critical accounting policies is included in the mda section of our annual report on form 10k filed with the sec on february under the heading application of critical accounting policies on january we adopted cecl under the cecl methodology the acl represents the expected lifetime credit losses on loans and leases that we dont expect to collect additionally see our critical accounting policy on goodwill and other intangible assets allowance for credit losses the acl is a valuation account that is deducted from the loans and leases amortized cost basis resulting in the net amount expected to be collected we charge off loans against the acl in accordance with our policies or if a loss confirming event occurs expected recoveries do not exceed the aggregate of the amounts previously chargedoff and expected to be chargedoff the model used to calculate the acl is dependent on the portfolio composition and credit quality as well as historical experience current conditions and forecasts of economic conditions and interest rates specifically the following considerations are incorporated into the acl calculation a thirdparty macroeconomic forecast scenario a 24month rs forecast period for macroeconomic factors with a reversion to the historical mean on a straightline basis over a 12month period and the historical throughthecycle mean calculated using an expanded period to include a prior recessionary period adjustments to historical loss information where applicable are made for differences in current loanspecific risk characteristics such as differences in lending policies and procedures underwriting standards experience and depth of relevant personnel the quality of our credit review function concentrations of credit external factors such as the regulatory legal and technological environments competition and events such as natural disasters and other relevant factors such factors are used to adjust the historical probabilities of default and severity of loss so that they reflect managements expectation of future conditions based on a rs forecast to the extent the lives of the loans in the portfolio extend beyond the period for which a rs forecast can be made the model reverts over months on a straightline basis back to the historical rates of default and severity of loss over the remaining life of the loans determining the appropriateness of the acl is complex and requires significant management judgment about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain due to those significant management judgments and the factors included in the calculation significant changes to the acl level could occur in future periods see note summary of significant accounting policies and the financial condition allowance for credit losses section later in this mda for further allowance for credit losses information goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of acquisitions we have recorded goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheets goodwill represents the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of net assets including identifiable intangible assets at the acquisition date our recorded goodwill relates to value inherent in our community banking wealth management and insurance segments the value of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles is dependent upon our ability to provide high quality costeffective services in the face of competition as such these values are supported ultimately by revenue that is driven by the volume of business transacted a decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth or our inability to deliver costeffective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment in value which could result in additional expense and adversely impact earnings in future periods goodwill and other intangibles are subject to impairment testing at the reporting unit level which must be conducted at least annually we perform impairment testing during the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if impairment indicators exist we also continue to monitor other intangibles for impairment and to evaluate carrying amounts as necessary in connection with the preparation of the second quarter financial statements we concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our community banking reporting unit was below its carrying amount due to a sustained decline in bank stock valuations which was primarily attributable to the systemic nearterm uncertainty of covid19 and its full impact on the global economy causing an unprecedented shock in interest rates and equity valuations therefore we performed an interim quantitative assessment of our community banking reporting unit as of june based on the results of the interim quantitative impairment assessments there were no impairments for the periods presented although not impaired the fair value of our community banking reporting unit declined since the last interim quantitative assessment at march the june interim quantitative assessment for our community banking reporting unit with billion of allocated goodwill resulted in an excess fair value over its carrying amount of less than as margins for fair value over carrying amount decline the risk of future impairment increases if any assumptions estimates or market factors change in the future we expect covid19 will continue to have a significant impact during the remainder of resulting in lower revenue growth and compressed net interest margins given the uncertainty related to the severity and length of the pandemic and the impact across the financial services industry we may be required to record impairment in the future any impairment charge would not affect our capital ratios tangible common equity or liquidity position determining fair values of each reporting unit of its individual assets and liabilities and also of other identifiable intangible assets requires considering market information that is publicly available as well as the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge inputs and assumptions used in estimating fair value include projected future cash flows discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows longterm growth rates and an evaluation of market comparables and recent transactions see note summary of significant accounting policies and note goodwill and other intangible assets in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets use of nongaap financial measures and key performance indicators to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with gaap we use certain nongaap financial measures such as operating net income available to common stockholders operating earnings per diluted common share return on average tangible common equity return on average tangible assets tangible book value per common share the ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets allowance for credit losses to loans and leases excluding ppp preprovision net revenue to average tangible common equity efficiency ratio and net interest margin fte to provide information useful to investors in understanding our operating performance and trends and to facilitate comparisons with the performance of our peers management uses these measures internally to assess and better understand our underlying business performance and trends related to core business activities the nongaap financial measures and key performance indicators we use may differ from the nongaap financial measures and key performance indicators other financial institutions use to assess their performance and trends these nongaap financial measures should be viewed as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for or superior to our reported results prepared in accordance with gaap when nongaap financial measures are disclosed the secs regulation g requires i the presentation of the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap and ii a reconciliation of the differences between the nongaap financial measure presented and the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap reconciliations of nongaap operating measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures are included later in this report under the heading reconciliations of nongaap financial measures and key performance indicators to gaap management believes charges such as branch consolidation costs and covid19 expenses are not organic costs to run our operations and facilities these charges are considered significant items impacting earnings as they are deemed to be outside of ordinary banking activities the branch consolidation charges principally represent expenses to satisfy contractual obligations of the closed branches without any useful ongoing benefit to us these costs are specific to each individual transaction and may vary significantly based on the size and complexity of the transaction the covid19 expenses represent special company initiatives to support our frontline employees and the communities we serve during an unprecedented time of a pandemic to provide more meaningful comparisons of net interest margin and efficiency ratio we use net interest income on a taxableequivalent basis in calculating net interest margin by increasing the interest income earned on taxexempt assets loans and investments to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments this adjustment is not permitted under gaap taxableequivalent amounts for the and periods were calculated using a federal statutory income tax rate of financial summary net income available to common stockholders for the second quarter of was million or per diluted common share compared to net income available to common stockholders for

significant impact on our second quarter financial results as presented in the preceding paragraph as well as our overall operations our previous and ongoing investments in technology and digital platforms enabled us to quickly meet customers needs in the pandemic environment the technology as well as other measures such as our business continuity planning helped us protect the health and safety of our employees who were there for our customers when they needed us most in this unprecedented and uncertain economic environment we frequently run stress tests for a variety of economic situations including severely adverse scenarios that have economic conditions similar to the current conditions under these scenarios the results of these stress tests indicate that our regulatory capital ratios would remain above the regulatory requirements and we would be able to maintain appropriate liquidity levels demonstrating our expected ability to continue to support our constituencies

ust announced that financial institution employees are part of the critical infrastructure workforce and stated that these employees have a special responsibility to maintain your normal work schedule as a result financial institutions were confronted with the challenge of protecting the health and safety of their employees while also ensuring that critical financial services such as providing consumer access to banking and lending services maintaining core systems and the integrity and security of data continuing the processing of payments and services such as payment clearing and settlement services wholesale funding insurance services and capital markets activities for the duration of the pandemic crisis period our crisis and risk management processes were critical to our preparedness for the covid19 pandemic since we had the necessary plans in place and had conducted a pandemic emergency event scenario involving key management and operations employees in the fourth quarter of to test the efficacy of our pandemic response plans and to improve these plans we are wellpositioned to continue to provide critical financial services to our customers through multiple channels such as interactive teller machines automated teller machines our mobile application and our interactive website we adjusted our physical retail locations by focusing on drive up services and closed our lobbies reverting to by appointment only practices while maintaining appropriate health sanitization social distancing and other safety protocols consistent with the centers for disease control and prevention cdc and state guidelines starting in july we reopened the majority of our branch lobbies to customers adhering to stringent safety measures including social distancing and cleaning protocols we leveraged our information technology infrastructure by making accommodations to give employees the ability to work remotely where appropriate our executive and senior management worked rotating schedules or from remote offices or home in order to mitigate the risk of widespread occurrence of the covid19 contagion among this group with respect to our other employees approximately half of our workforce worked remotely we will continue to actively monitor case levels and consider guidance from government agencies to determine when we activate further returntowork schedules our remote and rotational working arrangements and implementation of cdc health and safety protocols have not impaired our ability to continue to operate our business we do rely on some third parties for certain services such as armored cars for cash exchanges at this time we have not experienced a disruption in our core data processor system provider to protect our customers and communities from economic disruption we developed a formal loan deferral program and other measures to support customers who may be enduring financial hardships and actively participated in the sba ppp which authorized financial institutions to make federally guaranteed loans that are eligible to be forgiven to qualifying small businesses and nonprofits on the terms set forth in the cares act and related regulations we continue to evaluate other covid19 related frb and federal government relief and stimulus programs to determine their suitability for our customers and communities covid19 has had a significant impact on the provision for credit losses for the first half of after the adoption of cecl the uncertainty in the market a significant increase in unemployment and adverse economic forecasts all point to the volatility of the expected additional losses in the loan portfolio we would expect inherent volatility in the covid19 impact on our provision for credit losses for the duration of the current covid19 pandemic environment and immediate periods following the mitigation of the pandemic crisis the federal banking regulators have offered certain measures to assist financial institutions during this time some of these that impact us are as follows as part of section of the cares act and in accordance with federal bank regulatory interagency guidance financial institutions have been granted temporary relief from reporting tdrs caused by covid19 to be eligible for tdr relief a loan modification must be due to impacts from covid19 not more than days past due as of december and executed between march and the earlier of december or days after the end of the national emergency interagency guidance encourages financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers who are or may be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations because of the effects of covid19 and will not criticize financial institutions for working with borrowers in a safe and sound manner loan modification programs are considered positive actions that can mitigate adverse effects on borrowers due to covid19 institutions generally do not need to categorize covid19related loan modifications as tdrs if the loan modifications are shortterm in nature and are made on a good faith basis in response to covid19 to borrowers who were current at the time the modification program was implemented for borrowers who were current prior to covid19 that have requested and been granted a concession while experiencing a hardship during the pandemic we will not be including those modifications as past due or a tdr at the time of the concession as of june approximately billion or of our loan portfolio was approved during the initial deferment request window over of the billion of loans in deferment were current and in good standing at december the regulatory agencies have agreed to allow an option to delay the effects of cecl on regulatory capital by two years for those financial institutions that adopt in this delay will be followed by a threeyear transition period of and respectively we adopted cecl in january and have elected this option the frb initiated a facility to provide liquidity to financial institutions participating and funding loans for the ppp the nonrecourse loans are available to institutions eligible to make ppp loans with the sbaguaranteed loans pledged as collateral to the frb financial institutions can also pledge ppp loans to the discount window each liquidity option is set at different rates and terms ppp loans pledged to the ppplf may be excluded from leverage ratio calculations strong core deposit growth has satisfied our liquidity needs during the second quarter but the ppplf remains a liquidity option as we look ahead and move into the next phase of covid19 recovery we will continue to focus our response on four key pillars in an effort to meet the needs of each of our constituents the pillars are employee protection and assistance operational response and preparedness customer and community support and risk management and actions taken to preserve shareholder value given the extreme challenges presented libor the united kingdoms financial conduct authority fca who is the regulator of libor expects libor to cease to exist by the end of the frb of new york has created a working group called the alternative reference rate committee arrc that will help us institutions transition away from using libor as a benchmark interest rate similarly we created an internal working group that is managing our transition away from libor this working group is a crossfunctional team composed of representatives from the commercial retail and mortgage banking lines of business loan operations information technology legal finance and other support functions the committee has completed an assessment of tasks needed for the transition identified contracts that contain libor language is in process of reviewing existing contract language developed loan fallback language for when libor ceases to exist and identified risks associated with the transition the financial impact regarding pricing valuation and operations of the transition is not yet known our transition team will work within the guidelines established by the fca and arrc to allow a smooth transition away from libor

through the cares act such as the ppp began to assist our borrowers through the difficult financial disruptions we offered shortterm modifications to our customers to assist them through this period the programs our customers have taken advantage of are existing customers who were current prior to the start of the pandemic can elect to defer loan principal and interest payments or interest

reduction to retained earnings the acl balance increased by million and included a grossup to pci loan balances and the acl of million included in the cecl adoption impact was an increase of million to our aulc the model used to calculate the acl is dependent on the portfolio composition and credit quality as well as historical experience current conditions and forecasts of economic conditions and interest rates specifically the following considerations are incorporated into the acl calculation a thirdparty macroeconomic forecast scenario a 24month rs forecast period for macroeconomic factors with a reversion to the historical mean on a straightline basis over a 12month period and the historical through the cycle mean calculated using an expanded period to include a prior recessionary period covid19 impacts starting in march the broader economy experienced a significant deterioration in the macroeconomic environment driven by the covid19 pandemic resulting in notable adverse changes to forecasted economic variables utilized in our acl modeling process based on these changes we are utilizing a thirdparty pandemic recessionary macroeconomic forecast scenario for acl modeling purposes this scenario captures forecasted macroeconomic variables as of june to ensure our acl calculation considers the most recently available macroeconomic data in a quickly evolving environment at quarterend macroeconomic variables that we utilized from this scenario include but are not limited to i gdp which reflects a contraction of up to from the beginning of with average

the access to and cost of funding for new business initiatives the ability to engage in expanded business activities the ability to pay dividends and the level and nature of regulatory oversight depend in part on our capital position the assessment of capital adequacy depends on a number of factors such as expected organic growth in the consolidated balance sheet asset quality liquidity earnings performance changing competitive conditions regulatory changes or actions and economic forces we seek to maintain a strong capital base to support our growth and expansion activities to provide stability to current operations and to promote public confidence we have an effective shelf registration statement filed with the sec pursuant to this registration statement we may from time to time issue and sell in one or more offerings any combination of common stock preferred stock debt securities depositary shares warrants stock purchase contracts or units on february we completed an offering of million fixedtofloating rate subordinated notes due in under this registration statement the subordinated notes are treated as tier capital for regulatory capital purposes the net proceeds of the debt offering after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses were million we used the net proceeds from the sale of the subordinated notes to redeem higherrate longterm borrowings and for general corporate purposes on february we completed an offering of million of fixed rate senior notes due in under this registration statement the net proceeds of the debt offering after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses were million we will use the net proceeds from the sale of the notes for general corporate purposes which may include investments at the holding company level capital to support the growth of fnbpa repurchase of our common shares and refinancing of outstanding indebtedness on september we announced that our board of directors approved a share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to an aggregate of million of our common stock the repurchases will be made from time to time on the open market at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions the purchases will be funded from available working capital the repurchase program is expected to continue through the end of although we have temporarily suspended repurchase activity due to covid19 and the uncertainty in macroeconomic conditions there is no guarantee as to the exact number of shares that will be repurchased and we may discontinue purchases at any time capital management is a continuous process with capital plans and stress testing for fnb and fnbpa updated at least annually these capital plans include assessing the adequacy of expected capital levels assuming various scenarios by projecting capital needs for a forecast period of years beyond the current year from time to time we issue shares initially acquired by us as treasury stock under our various benefit plans we may issue additional preferred or common stock in order to maintain our wellcapitalized status fnb and fnbpa are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies see discussion under enhanced regulatory capital standards quantitative measures established by regulators to ensure capital adequacy require fnb and fnbpa to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total tier and common equity tier capital as defined in the regulations to riskweighted assets as defined and minimum leverage ratio as defined failure to meet minimum capital requirements could lead to initiation of certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could have a direct material effect on our consolidated financial statements dividends and future business and corporate strategies under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action fnb and fnbpa must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets liabilities and certain offbalance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices fnbs and fnbpas capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components risk weightings and other factors at june the capital levels of both fnb and fnbpa exceeded all regulatory capital requirements and their regulatory capital ratios were above the minimum levels required to be considered wellcapitalized for regulatory purposes in december the frb and other us banking agencies approved a final rule to address the impact of cecl on regulatory capital by allowing bhcs and banks including fnb the option to phase in the dayone impact of cecl over a threeyear period in march the frb and other us banking agencies issued an interim final rule that became effective on march and that provides bhcs and banks with an alternative option to temporarily delay the estimate of the impact of cecl relative to the incurred loss methodology for estimating the acl on regulatory capital we have elected this alternative option instead of the one described in the december rule as a result under the interim final rule we will delay recognizing the estimated impact of cecl on regulatory capital until after a twoyear deferral period which for us extends through december beginning on january we will be required to phase in of the previously deferred estimated capital impact of cecl with an additional to be phased in at the beginning of each subsequent year until fully phased in by the first quarter of under the interim final rule the estimated impact of cecl on regulatory capital that we will defer and later phase in is calculated as the entire dayone impact at adoption plus of the subsequent change in the acl during the twoyear deferral period during the first and second quarter of the total deferred impact on common equity tier capital related to our adoption of cecl was approximately million and million respectively in this unprecedented economic and uncertain environment we frequently run stress tests for a variety of economic situations including severely adverse scenarios that have economic conditions similar to the current conditions under these scenarios the results of these stress tests indicate that our regulatory capital ratios would remain above the regulatory requirements and we would be able to maintain appropriate liquidity levels demonstrating our expected ability

the minimum requirements needed to avoid limitations on distributions of dividends and certain discretionary bonus payments doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of doddfrank act the doddfrank act broadly affects the financial services industry by establishing a framework for systemic risk oversight creating a resolution authority for institutions determined to be systemically important mandating higher capital and liquidity requirements requiring banks to pay increased fees to regulatory agencies and containing numerous other provisions aimed at strengthening the sound operation of the financial services sector that significantly change the system of regulatory oversight as described in more detail under part i item business government supervision and regulation included in our annual report on form 10k as filed with the sec on february certain aspects of the doddfrank act remain subject to regulatory rulemaking and amendments to such previously promulgated rules thereby making it difficult to anticipate with certainty the impact to us or the financial services industry resulting from this rulemaking process liquidity our goal in liquidity management is to satisfy the cash flow requirements of customers and the operating cash needs of fnb with costeffective funding our board of directors has established an assetliability management policy to guide management in achieving and maintaining earnings performance consistent with longterm goals while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate risk a wellcapitalized balance sheet and adequate levels of liquidity our board of directors has also established liquidity and contingency funding policies to guide management in addressing the ability to identify measure monitor and control both normal and stressed liquidity conditions these policies designate our assetliability committee as the body responsible for meeting these objectives the alco which is comprised of members of executive management reviews liquidity on a continuous basis and approves significant changes in strategies that affect balance sheet or cash flow positions liquidity is centrally managed daily by our treasury department fnbpa generates liquidity from its normal business operations liquidity sources from assets include payments from loans and investments as well as the ability to securitize pledge or sell loans investment securities and other assets liquidity sources from liabilities are generated primarily through the banking offices of fnbpa in the form of deposits and customer repurchase agreements fnb also has access to reliable and costeffective wholesale sources of liquidity short and longterm funds are used to help fund normal business operations and unused credit availability can be utilized to serve as contingency funding if we would be faced with a liquidity crisis the principal sources of the parent companys liquidity are its strong existing cash resources plus dividends it receives from its subsidiaries these dividends may be impacted by the parents or its subsidiaries capital needs statutory laws and regulations corporate policies contractual restrictions profitability and other factors in addition through one of our subsidiaries we regularly issue subordinated notes which are guaranteed by fnb management has utilized various strategies to ensure sufficient cash on hand is available to meet the parents funding needs on february we completed a senior debt offering whereby we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in the proceeds from this transaction are for general corporate purposes and were the primary factor resulting in an increase in our months of cash on hand mch liquidity metric as shown below starting in march management incorporated potential liquidity impacts related to covid19 into our daily analysis management concluded that our cash levels remain appropriate given the current market environment two metrics that are used to gauge the adequacy of the parent companys cash position are the lcr and mch the lcr is defined as the sum of cash on hand plus projected cash inflows over the next months divided by projected cash outflows over the next months the mch is defined as the number of months of corporate expenses and dividends that can be covered by the cash on hand the lcr and mch ratios are presented in the following table table june december internal limit liquidity coverage ratio times times time months of cash on hand months months months our liquidity position has been positively impacted by our ability to generate growth in relationshipbased accounts organic growth in lowcost transaction deposits was complemented by managements strategy of heightened deposit gathering efforts focused on attracting new customer relationships and deepening relationships with existing customers in part through internal lead generation efforts leveraging data analytics capabilities total deposits were billion at june an increase of billion or annualized from december total noninterestbearing demand deposit accounts grew by billion or annualized and interestbearing demand increased by billion or annualized savings account balances increased million or annualized time deposits declined million or annualized as mentioned earlier inflows from ppp and government stimulus checks were a significant factor in the deposit growth during the second quarter fnbpa has significant unused wholesale credit availability sources that include the availability to borrow from the fhlb the frb correspondent bank lines access to brokered deposits the ppplf and multiple other channels in addition to credit availability fnbpa also possesses salable unpledged government and agency securities that could be utilized to meet funding needs the alco minimum guideline level for salable unpledged government and agency securities is the following table presents certain information relating to fnbpas credit availability and salable unpledged securities table  in millions june december unused wholesale credit availability unused wholesale credit availability as a of fnbpa assets salable unpledged government and agency securities salable unpledged government and agency securities as a of fnbpa assets the ppplf accounted for billion of the increase in availability since december this funding source terminates on september another metric for measuring liquidity risk is the liquidity gap analysis the following liquidity gap analysis as of june compares the difference between our cash flows from existing earning assets and interestbearing liabilities over future time intervals management seeks to limit the size of the liquidity gaps so that sources and uses of funds are reasonably matched in the normal course of business a reasonably matched position lays a better foundation for dealing with additional funding needs during a potential liquidity crisis the twelvemonth cumulative gap to total assets ratio improved to as of june from as of december management calculates this ratio at least quarterly and it is reviewed monthly by alco table  in millions within month months months months total year assets loans investments liabilities nonmaturity deposits time deposits borrowings period gap assets liabilities cumulative gap cumulative gap to total assets in addition the alco regularly monitors various liquidity ratios and stress scenarios of our liquidity position the stress scenarios forecast that adequate funding will be available even under severe conditions management believes we have sufficient liquidity available to meet our normal operating and contingency funding cash needs market risk market risk refers to potential losses arising predominately from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices we are primarily exposed to interest rate risk inherent in our lending and deposittaking activities as a financial intermediary to succeed in this capacity we offer an extensive variety of financial products to meet the diverse needs of our customers these products sometimes contribute to interest rate risk for us when product groups do not complement one another for example depositors may want shortterm deposits while borrowers may desire longterm loans changes in market interest rates may result in changes in the fair value of our financial instruments cash flows and net interest income subject to its ongoing oversight the board of directors has given alco the responsibility for market risk management which involves devising policy guidelines risk measures and limits and managing the amount of interest rate risk and its effect on net interest income and capital we use derivative financial instruments for interest rate risk management purposes and not for trading or speculative purposes interest rate risk is comprised of repricing risk basis risk yield curve risk and options risk repricing risk arises from differences in the cash flow or repricing between asset and liability portfolios basis risk arises when asset and liability portfolios are related to different market rate indexes which do not always change by the same amount yield curve risk arises when asset and liability portfolios are related to different maturities on a given yield curve when the yield curve changes shape the risk position is altered options risk arises from embedded options within asset and liability products as certain borrowers have the option to prepay their loans which may be with or without penalty when rates fall while certain depositors can redeem their certificates of deposit early which may be with or without penalty when rates rise we use an assetliability model to measure our interest rate risk interest rate risk measures we utilize include earnings simulation eve and gap analysis gap analysis and eve are static measures that do not incorporate assumptions regarding future business gap analysis while a helpful diagnostic tool displays cash flows for only a single rate environment eves longterm horizon helps identify changes in optionality and longerterm positions however eves liquidation perspective does not translate into the earningsbased measures that are the focus of managing and valuing a going concern net interest income simulations explicitly measure the exposure to earnings from changes in market rates of interest in these simulations our current financial position is combined with assumptions regarding future business to calculate net interest income under various hypothetical rate scenarios the alco reviews earnings simulations over multiple years under various interest rate scenarios on a periodic basis reviewing these various measures provides us with a comprehensive view of our interest rate risk profile which provides the basis for balance sheet management strategies the following repricing gap analysis as of june compares the difference between the amount of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities subject to repricing over a period of time management utilizes the repricing gap analysis as a diagnostic tool in managing net interest income and eve risk measures table  in millions within month months months months total year assets loans investments liabilities nonmaturity deposits time deposits borrowings offbalance sheet period gap assets liabilities offbalance sheet cumulative gap cumulative gap to assets the twelvemonth cumulative repricing gap to total assets was and as of june and december respectively the positive cumulative gap positions indicate that we have a greater amount of repricing earning assets than repricing interestbearing liabilities over the subsequent twelve months if interest rates increase as modeled net interest income will increase and conversely if interest rates decrease as modeled net interest income will decrease the change in the cumulative repricing gap at june compared to december is primarily related to growth and changes in the mix of loans deposits and borrowings strong commercial and industrial loan growth a portion of which was swapped to adjustable rates and the increased cash flow from the loan and investment portfolios were partially offset by growth in and repricing of certain interestbearing nonmaturity deposit balances and the funding of fhlb advances the funding of both fixed and adjustable borrowings was opportunistically transacted to take advantage of the lower interest rate environment and add liquidity to support loan growth the allocation of nonmaturity deposits and customer repurchase agreements to the onemonth maturity category above is based on the estimated sensitivity of each product to changes in market rates for example if a products rate is estimated to increase by as much as the market rates then of the account balance was placed in this category utilizing net interest income simulations the following net interest income metrics were calculated using rate shocks which move market rates in an immediate and parallel fashion the variance percentages represent the change between the net interest income and eve calculated under the particular rate scenario versus the net interest income and eve that was calculated assuming market rates as of june using a static balance sheet structure the measures do not reflect all of managements potential counteractions the following table presents an analysis of the potential sensitivity of our net interest income and eve to changes in interest rates using rate shocks table june december alco limits net interest income change months basis points na basis points basis points basis points economic value of equity basis points basis points basis points basis points we also model rate scenarios which move all rates gradually over twelve months rate ramps and model scenarios that gradually change the shape of the yield curve assuming a static balance sheet a basis point rate ramp increases net interest income months by at june and at december the corresponding metrics for a basis point rate ramp are and at june and december respectively our strategy is generally to manage to a neutral interest rate risk position consistent with prior quarters we desired to remain slightly assetsensitive there are multiple factors that influence our interest rate risk position and impact net interest income these include external factors such as the shape of the yield curve and expectations regarding future interest rates as well as internal factors regarding product offerings product mix and pricing of loans and deposits management utilizes various tactics to achieve our desired interest rate risk irr position in response to the change in interest rates management was proactive in addressing our irr position as mentioned earlier we were successful in growing our transaction deposits which provides funding that is less interest ratesensitive than shortterm time deposits and wholesale borrowings also we were able to lower rates on deposit products and shorten the term of the certificates of deposit volumes this continues to be an intense focus of management further during the first six months of management took advantage of the interest rate environment to reduce borrowing costs on the lending side we regularly sell longterm fixedrate residential mortgages to the secondary market and have been successful in the origination of consumer and commercial loans with shortterm repricing characteristics in particular we have made use of interest rate swaps to commercial borrowers commercial swaps to manage our irr position as the commercial swaps effectively increase adjustablerate loans total variable and adjustablerate loans were and of total loans as of june and december respectively with of these loans or of total loans tied to the prime or onemonth libor rates as of june the commercial swaps totaled billion of notional principal with million in original notional swap principal originated during the first six months of for additional information regarding interest rate swaps see note in this report the investment portfolio is also used in part to manage our irr position these purchases are predominately fixed rate in nature in which we seek to minimize prepayment risk we recognize that all assetliability models have some inherent shortcomings assetliability models require certain assumptions to be made such as prepayment rates on interestearning assets and repricing impact on nonmaturity deposits which may differ from actual experience these business assumptions are based upon our experience business plans economic and market trends and available industry data while management believes that its methodology for developing such assumptions is reasonable there can be no assurance that modeled results will be achieved furthermore the metrics are based upon the balance sheet structure as of the valuation date and do not reflect the planned growth or management actions that could be taken risk management as a financial institution we take on a certain amount of risk in every business decision transaction and activity our board of directors and senior management have identified seven major categories of risk credit risk market risk liquidity risk reputational risk operational risk legal and compliance risk and strategic risk in its oversight role of our risk management function the board of directors focuses on the strategies analyses and conclusions of management relating to identifying understanding and managing risks so as to optimize total stockholder value while balancing prudent business and safety and soundness considerations the board of directors adopted a risk appetite statement that defines acceptable risk levels and limits under which we seek to operate in order to optimize returns as such the board monitors a series of kris or key risk indicators for various business lines operational units and risk categories providing insight into how our performance aligns with our stated risk appetite these results are
