annual report on s with the sec which are available on our corporate website at httpswwwfnbonlinecomaboutusinvestorinformationreportsandfilings or the secs website at wwwsecgov more specifically our forwardlooking statements may be subject to the evolving risks and uncertainties related to the covid19 pandemic and its macroeconomic impact and the resulting governmental business and societal responses to it we have included our web address as an inactive textual reference only information on our website is not part of our sec filings application of critical accounting policies a description of our critical accounting policies is included in the mda section of our annual report on form 10k filed with the sec on february under the heading application of critical accounting policies there have been no significant changes in critical accounting policies or the assumptions and judgments utilized in applying these policies since december use of nongaap financial measures and key performance indicators to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with gaap we use certain nongaap financial measures such as operating net income available to common stockholders operating earnings per diluted common share return on average tangible common equity return on average tangible assets tangible book value per common share the ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets average deposits excluding howard average deposits loans and leases excluding ppp loans and howard loans as of the acquisition date excluding ppp loans acl to loans and leases excluding ppp loans preprovision net revenue to average tangible common equity efficiency ratio and net interest margin fte to provide information useful to investors in understanding our operating performance and trends and to facilitate comparisons with the performance of our peers management uses these measures internally to assess and better understand our underlying business performance and trends related to core business activities the nongaap financial measures and key performance indicators we use may differ from the nongaap financial measures and key performance indicators other financial institutions use to assess their performance and trends these nongaap financial measures should be viewed as supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for or superior to our reported results prepared in accordance with gaap when nongaap financial measures are disclosed the secs regulation g requires i the presentation of the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap and ii a reconciliation of the differences between the nongaap financial measure presented and the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap reconciliations of nongaap operating measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures are included later in this report under the heading reconciliations of nongaap financial measures and key performance indicators to gaap management believes items such as merger expenses initial provision for nonpcd loans acquired and branch consolidation costs are not organic to run our operations and facilities these items are considered significant items impacting earnings as they are deemed to be outside of ordinary banking activities the merger expenses and branch consolidation costs principally represent expenses to satisfy contractual obligations of the acquired entity or closed branch without any useful ongoing benefit to us these costs are specific to each individual transaction and may vary significantly based on the size and complexity of the transaction to facilitate peer comparisons of net interest margin and efficiency ratio we use net interest income on a taxableequivalent basis in calculating net interest margin by increasing the interest income earned on taxexempt assets loans and investments to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments this adjustment is not permitted under gaap taxableequivalent amounts for the and periods were

through june bank regulators in a joint statement have urged banks to stop using libor altogether on new transactions by the end of to avoid the possible creation of safety and soundness risk the frb of new york has created a working group called the alternative reference rate committee arrc to assist us institutions in transitioning away from libor as a benchmark interest rate the arrc has recommended the use of sofr as a replacement index for libor similarly we created an internal transition team that is managing our transition away from libor this transition team is a crossfunctional team composed of representatives from the commercial retail and mortgage banking lines of business as well as representatives of loan operations information technology legal finance and other support functions the transition team has completed an assessment of tasks needed for the transition identified contracts that contain libor language reviewed existing contract language for the presence of appropriate fallback rate language developed and implemented loan fallback rate language for when libor is retired and identified risks associated with the transition the transition team has chosen sofr as the primary replacement index for libor but other creditsensitive indices are available for the benefit of our customers we started originating commercial loans utilizing sofr and other indices in the fourth quarter of during the first quarter of we originated in excess of million in sofr indexed loans in addition approximately million of residential mortgages indexed to sofr were

forecast scenario a 24month rs forecast period for macroeconomic factors with a reversion to the historical mean on a straightline basis over a 12month period and the historical through the cycle default mean calculated using an expanded period to include a prior recessionary period at march and december we utilized a thirdparty consensus macroeconomic forecast due to the improving macroeconomic environment for our acl calculation at march the macroeconomic variables that we utilized included but were not limited to i the purchase only housing price index which reflects growth

liquid products while maintaining larger deposit account balances the deposit growth helped us eliminate overnight borrowings and reduce highercost shortterm fhlb borrowings and their related swaps capital resources and regulatory matters the access to and cost of funding for new business initiatives the ability to engage in expanded business activities the ability to pay dividends and the level and nature of regulatory oversight depend in part on our capital position the assessment of capital adequacy depends on a number of factors such as expected organic growth in the consolidated balance sheet asset quality liquidity earnings performance and sustainability changing competitive conditions regulatory changes or actions and economic forces we seek to maintain a strong capital base to support our growth and expansion activities to provide stability to current operations and to promote public confidence we have an effective shelf registration statement filed with the sec pursuant to this registration statement we may from time to time issue and sell in one or more offerings any combination of common stock preferred stock debt securities depositary shares warrants stock purchase

including the additional amount approved in april the repurchases will be made from time to time on the open market at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions the purchases will be funded from available working capital there is no guarantee as to the exact number of shares that will be repurchased and we may discontinue purchases at any time capital management is a continuous process with capital plans and stress testing for fnb and fnbpa updated at least annually these capital plans include assessing the adequacy of expected capital levels assuming various scenarios by projecting capital needs for a forecast period of years beyond the current year from time to time we issue shares initially acquired by us as treasury stock under our various benefit plans we may issue additional preferred or common stock to maintain our wellcapitalized status fnb and fnbpa are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies see discussion under enhanced regulatory capital standards quantitative measures established by regulators to ensure capital adequacy require fnb and fnbpa to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total tier and cet1 capital as defined in the regulations to riskweighted assets as defined and a minimum leverage ratio as defined failure to meet minimum capital requirements could lead to initiation of certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could have a direct material effect on our consolidated financial statements dividends and future business and corporate strategies under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action fnb and fnbpa must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets liabilities and certain offbalance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices fnbs and fnbpas capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components risk weightings and other factors at march the capital levels of both fnb and fnbpa exceeded all regulatory capital requirements and their regulatory capital ratios were above the minimum levels required to be considered wellcapitalized for regulatory purposes in december the frb and other us banking agencies approved a rule to address the impact of cecl on regulatory capital by allowing bhcs and banks including fnb the option to phase in the dayone impact of cecl over a threeyear period in march the frb and other us banking agencies issued a final rule that became effective on march and provides bhcs and banks with an alternative option to temporarily delay the impact of cecl relative to the incurred loss methodology for the acl on regulatory capital we have elected this alternative option instead of the one described in the december rule as a result under the final rule we delayed recognizing the estimated impact of cecl on regulatory capital until after a twoyear deferral period which for us extended through december beginning on january we will be required to phase in of the previously deferred capital impact of cecl with an additional to be phased in at the beginning of each subsequent year until fully phased in by the first quarter of under the final rule the estimated impact of cecl on regulatory capital that we will defer and later phase in is calculated as the entire dayone impact at adoption plus of the subsequent change in the acl during the twoyear deferral period as of march the total deferred impact on cet1 capital related to our adoption of cecl was approximately million or basis points which will continue to be reduced by approximately million annually in this unprecedented economic and uncertain environment we frequently run stress tests for a variety of economic situations including severely adverse scenarios that have economic conditions like the current conditions under these scenarios the results of these stress tests indicate that our regulatory capital ratios would remain above the regulatory requirements and we would be able to maintain appropriate

doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of doddfrank act the doddfrank act broadly affects the financial services industry by establishing a framework for systemic risk oversight creating a resolution authority for institutions determined to be systemically important mandating higher capital and liquidity requirements requiring banks to pay increased fees to regulatory agencies and containing numerous other provisions aimed at strengthening the sound operation of the financial services sector that significantly change the system of regulatory oversight as described

and other factors in addition through one of our subsidiaries we regularly issue subordinated notes which are guaranteed by fnb the cash position at march was million down million from yearend due primarily to million in share repurchases management has utilized various strategies to ensure sufficient cash on hand is available to meet the parents funding needs two metrics that are used to gauge the adequacy of the parent companys cash position are the liquidity coverage ratio lcr and months of cash on hand mch the lcr is defined as the sum of cash on hand plus projected cash inflows over the next months divided by projected cash outflows over the next months the mch is defined as the number of months of corporate expenses and dividends that can be covered by the cash on hand the lcr and mch ratios are presented in the following table table march december internal limit liquidity coverage ratio times times time months of cash on hand months months months management has concluded that our cash levels remain appropriate given the current market environment our liquidity position has been positively impacted by our ability to generate growth in relationshipbased accounts organic growth in lowcost transaction deposits was complemented by managements strategy of deposit gathering efforts focused on attracting new customer relationships and deepening relationships with existing customers in part through internal lead generation efforts leveraging data analytics capabilities we have also increased customer deposit relationships due to the success of the ppp total deposits increased billion or from december primarily as a result of growth in noninterestbearing and interestbearing demand balances due to the howard acquisition as well as an expansion of customer relationships and higher customer balances customer preferences continued to shift away from higher rate certificates of deposit to lower yielding more liquid products while maintaining larger deposit account balances our liquidity position enabled us to eliminate howards overnight borrowings and retire million of highercost fhlb borrowings total noninterestbearing demand deposit accounts grew million or and interestbearing demand deposits increased million or savings account balances increased million or time deposits increased million or as a result of the howard acquisition in addition customers maintained larger balances in their deposit accounts than before the pandemic as mentioned earlier inflows from ppp and government stimulus were a significant factor in the deposit growth our cash balances held at the frb increased million from december to billion at march fnbpa has significant unused wholesale credit availability sources that include the availability to borrow from the fhlb the frb correspondent bank lines access to brokered deposits and other channels in addition to credit availability fnbpa also possesses salable unpledged government and agency securities that could be utilized to meet funding needs we currently also have excess cash to meet our pledging requirements at march we have billion of cash and salable unpledged government and agency securities to total assets or this compares to a policy minimum of the following table presents certain information relating to fnbpas credit availability and salable unpledged securities table  in millions march december unused wholesale credit availability unused wholesale credit availability as a of fnbpa assets salable unpledged government and agency securities salable unpledged government and agency securities as a of fnbpa assets cash and salable unpledged government and agency securities as a of fnbpa assets the increase in unused wholesale credit availability was due to increased borrowing capacity with the fhlb another metric for measuring liquidity risk is the liquidity gap analysis the following liquidity gap analysis as of march compares the difference between our cash flows from existing earning assets and interestbearing liabilities over future time intervals management monitors the size of the liquidity gaps so that sources and uses of funds are reasonably matched in the normal course of business and in relation to implied forward rate expectations a reasonably matched position lays a better foundation for dealing with additional funding needs during a potential liquidity crisis a positive gap position means that more assets are repricing over the next months than liabilities and net interest income would benefit if interest rates were to rise the twelvemonth cumulative gap to total assets ratio was as of march compared to as of december management calculates this ratio at least quarterly and it is reviewed monthly by alco table  in millions within month months months months total year assets loans investments liabilities nonmaturity deposits time deposits borrowings period gap assets liabilities cumulative gap cumulative gap to total assets in addition the alco regularly monitors various liquidity ratios and stress scenarios of our liquidity position the stress scenarios forecast that adequate funding will be available even under severe conditions management believes we have sufficient liquidity available to meet our normal operating and contingency funding cash needs market risk market risk refers to potential losses arising predominately from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices we are primarily exposed to interest rate risk inherent in our lending and deposittaking activities as a financial intermediary to succeed in this capacity we offer an extensive variety of financial products to meet the diverse needs of our customers these products sometimes contribute to interest rate risk for us when product groups do not complement one another for example depositors may want shortterm deposits while borrowers may desire longterm loans changes in market interest rates may result in changes in the fair value of our financial instruments cash flows and net interest income subject to its ongoing oversight the board of directors has given alco the responsibility for market risk management which involves devising policy guidelines risk measures and limits and managing the amount of interest rate risk and its effect on net interest income and capital we use derivative financial instruments for interest rate risk management purposes and not for trading or speculative purposes interest rate risk is comprised of repricing risk basis risk yield curve risk and options risk repricing risk arises from differences in the cash flow or repricing between asset and liability portfolios basis risk arises when asset and liability portfolios are related to different market rate indices which do not always change by the same amount yield curve risk arises when asset and liability portfolios are related to different maturities on a given yield curve when the yield curve changes shape the risk position is altered options risk arises from embedded options within asset and liability products as certain borrowers have the option to prepay their loans which may be with or without penalty when rates fall while certain depositors can redeem their certificates of deposit early which may be with or without penalty when rates rise we use an assetliability model to measure our interest rate risk interest rate risk measures we utilize include earnings simulation eve and gap analysis gap analysis and eve are static measures that do not incorporate assumptions regarding future business gap analysis while a helpful diagnostic tool displays cash flows for only a single rate environment eves longterm horizon helps identify changes in optionality and longerterm positions however eves liquidation perspective does not translate into the earningsbased measures that are the focus of managing and valuing a going concern net interest income simulations explicitly measure the exposure to earnings from changes in market rates of interest in these simulations our current financial position is combined with assumptions regarding future business to calculate net interest income under various hypothetical rate scenarios the alco reviews earnings simulations over multiple years under various interest rate scenarios on a periodic basis reviewing these various measures provides us with a comprehensive view of our interest rate risk profile which provides the basis for balance sheet management strategies the following repricing gap analysis as of march compares the difference between the amount of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities subject to repricing over a period of time management utilizes the repricing gap analysis as a diagnostic tool in managing net interest income and eve risk measures table  in millions within month months months months total year assets loans investments liabilities nonmaturity deposits time deposits borrowings offbalance sheet period gap assets liabilities offbalance sheet cumulative gap cumulative gap to assets the twelvemonth cumulative repricing gap to total assets was and as of march and december respectively the positive cumulative gap positions indicate that we have a greater amount of repricing earning assets than repricing interestbearing liabilities over the subsequent twelve months if interest rates increase as modeled net interest income will increase and conversely if interest rates decrease as modeled net interest income will decrease the change in the cumulative repricing gap at march compared to december is primarily related to the howard acquisition the allocation of nonmaturity deposits and customer repurchase agreements to the onemonth maturity category above is based on the estimated sensitivity of each product to changes in market rates for example if a products rate is estimated to increase by as much as the market rates then of the account balance was placed in this category utilizing net interest income simulations the following net interest income metrics were calculated using rate shocks which move market rates in an immediate and parallel fashion the variance percentages represent the change between the net interest income and eve calculated under the particular rate scenario compared to the net interest income and eve that was calculated assuming market rates as of march using a static balance sheet structure the measures do not reflect managements potential counteractions the following table presents an analysis of the potential sensitivity of our net interest income and eve to changes in interest rates using rate shocks table march december alco limits net interest income change months basis points na basis points basis points basis points economic value of equity basis points basis points basis points basis points we also model rate scenarios which move all rates gradually over twelve months rate ramps and model scenarios that gradually change the shape of the yield curve assuming a static balance sheet a basis point rate ramp increases net interest income months by at march and at december for a basis point rate ramp net interest income months increases by at march the corresponding metrics for a minus basis point rate ramp are and at march and december respectively deposit rate assumptions are floored at zero in the negative scenarios the frbs rapid and large downward interest rate moves in march as a response to the covid19 pandemic lowered all market interest rates specifically prime rate and 1month libor fortynine percent of our net loans and leases are indexed to shortterm libor sofr and prime that reprice within the next three months our increased cash position related to increased deposits has also been a significant factor in our metrics assuming no replacement the estimated impact of available cash in the 200shock scenario above accounts for of the total asset sensitivity these factors were the primary drivers of the increase in asset sensitivity our balance sheet is positioned to benefit from the federal open market committee fomc increase of the federal funds rate on march and the significant increases currently priced into the market there are multiple factors that influence our interest rate risk position and impact net interest income these include external factors such as the shape of the yield curve and expectations regarding future interest rates as well as internal factors regarding product offerings product mix and pricing of loans and deposits management utilizes various tactics to achieve our desired interest rate risk irr position in response to the change in interest rates management was proactive in managing our irr position as mentioned earlier we were successful in growing our transaction deposits which provides funding that is less interest ratesensitive than shortterm time deposits and wholesale borrowings also we were able to lower rates on deposit products and shorten the average maturity of the certificates of deposit volumes managements focus is to opportunistically deploy cash into higher yielding customer loans furthermore we regularly sell longterm fixedrate residential mortgages in the secondary market and have been successful in the origination of consumer and commercial loans with shortterm repricing characteristics in particular we have made use of interest rate swaps to commercial borrowers commercial swaps to manage our irr position as the commercial swaps effectively increase adjustablerate loans total variable and adjustablerate loans were of total net loans and leases as of march and as of december as of march the commercial swaps totaled billion of notional principal with million in original notional swap principal originated during the first three months of in we also executed billion in receive fixedpay floating 1month libor interest rate swaps with an average life of years as a hedge to additional asset sensitivity for additional information regarding interest rate swaps see note derivative instruments and hedging activities in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this report the investment portfolio is also used in part to manage our irr position we recognize that all assetliability models have some inherent shortcomings assetliability models require certain assumptions to be made such as prepayment rates on interestearning assets and repricing impact on nonmaturity deposits which may differ from actual experience these business assumptions are based upon our experience business plans economic and market trends and available industry data while management believes that its methodology for developing such assumptions is reasonable there can be no assurance that modeled results will be achieved furthermore the metrics are based upon the balance sheet structure as of the valuation date and do not reflect the planned growth or management actions that could be taken risk management as a financial institution we take on a certain amount of risk in every business decision transaction and activity our board of directors and senior management have identified seven major categories of risk credit risk market risk liquidity risk reputational risk operational risk legal and compliance risk and strategic risk in its oversight role of our risk management function the board of directors focuses on the strategies analyses and conclusions of management relating to identifying understanding and managing risks so as to optimize total shareholder value while balancing prudent business and safety and soundness considerations the board of directors adopted a risk appetite statement that defines acceptable risk levels and limits under which we seek to operate in order to optimize returns as such the board monitors a series of kris or key risk indicators for various business lines operational units and risk categories providing insight into how our performance aligns with our stated risk appetite these results are reviewed periodically by the board of directors and senior management to ensure adherence to our risk appetite statement and where appropriate adjustments are made to applicable business strategies and tactics where risks are approaching stated tolerances or for emerging risks we support our risk management process through a governance structure involving our board of directors and senior management the joint risk committee of our board of directors and the fnbpa board of directors helps ensure that business decisions are executed within appropriate risk tolerances the risk committee has oversight responsibilities with respect to the following identification measurement assessment and monitoring of enterprisewide risk development of appropriate and meaningful risk metrics to use in connection with the oversight of our businesses and strategies review and assessment of our policies and practices to manage our credit market liquidity legal regulatory and operating risk including technology operational compliance and fiduciary risks and identification and implementation of risk management best practices the risk committee serves as the primary point of contact between our board of directors and the risk management council which is the senior management level committee responsible for risk management risk appetite is an integral element of our business and capital planning processes through our board risk committee and risk management council we use our risk appetite processes to promote appropriate alignment of risk capital and performance tactics while also considering risk capacity and appetite constraints from both financial and nonfinancial risks our topdown risk appetite process serves as a limit for undue risktaking for bottomup planning from our various business functions our board risk committee in collaboration with our risk management council approves our risk appetite on an annual basis or more frequently as needed to reflect changes in the risk regulatory economic and strategic plan environments with the goal of ensuring that our risk appetite remains consistent with our strategic plans and business operations regulatory environment and our shareholders expectations reports relating to our risk appetite and strategic plans and our ongoing monitoring thereof are regularly presented to our various management level risk oversight and planning committees and periodically reported up through our board risk committee as noted above we have a risk management council comprised of senior management the purpose of this committee is to provide regular oversight of specific areas of risk with respect to the level of risk and risk management structure management has also established an operational risk committee that is responsible for identifying evaluating and monitoring operational risks across fnb evaluating and approving appropriate remediation efforts to address identified operational risks and providing periodic reports concerning operational risks to the risk management council the risk management council reports on a regular basis to the risk committee of our board of directors regarding our enterprisewide risk profile and other significant risk management issues our chief risk officer is responsible for the design and implementation of our enterprisewide risk management strategy and framework through the multiple second line of defense areas including the following departments which all report to the chief risk officer to ensure the coordinated and consistent implementation of risk management initiatives and strategies on a daytoday basis

business resumption in the event of a disaster as discussed in more detail under the covid19 section of this report we have in place various business and emergency continuity plans to respond to different crises and circumstances which include rapid deployment of our crisis management team incident management team and business continuity coordinators to activate our plans for various types of emergency circumstance further our audit function performs an independent assessment of our internal controls environment and plays an integral role in testing the operation of the internal controls systems and reporting findings to management and our audit committee each of the risk audit credit risk and cra committees of our board of directors regularly report on riskrelated matters to the full board of directors in addition both the risk committee of our board of directors and our risk management council regularly assess our enterprisewide risk profile and provide guidance on actions needed to address key and emerging risk issues the board of directors believes that our enterprisewide risk management process is effective and enables the board of directors to assess the quality of the information they receive understand the businesses investments and financial accounting legal regulatory and strategic considerations and the risks that fnb faces oversee and assess how senior management evaluates risk and assess appropriately the quality of our enterprisewide risk management process reconciliations of nongaap financial measures and key performance indicators to gaap
