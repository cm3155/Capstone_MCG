the closing conditions set forth in the merger agreement some of which are outside of the parties control the merger agreement contains a number of conditions that must be fulfilled in order to complete the merger those conditions include absence of any law statute or regulation or any order injunction or other legal restraint or prohibition preventing the completion of the merger the accuracy of the representations and warranties of both parties subject to applicable materiality qualifiers and the performance in all material respects by both parties of their respective covenants

oversight which could have the effect of delaying completion of the merger or of imposing additional costs or limitations on us following the merger we may elect not to consummate the merger if any governmental or regulatory entity imposes a restriction requirement or condition on us that individually or in the aggregate would be reasonably likely to have a material and adverse effect on us and our subsidiaries taken as a whole after giving effect to the merger we will be subject to business uncertainties while the merger is pending which could result in loss of key employees or customers uncertainties about the effect of the merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on us these uncertainties may impair our ability to attract retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is completed and could cause customers and others that deal with us to consider changing their existing business relationships with us or cause ub bancorp customers to seek another financial services provider retention of certain ub bancorp employees may be challenging during the pendency of the merger as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles if key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the business our business could be negatively impacted if the merger is not completed we will have incurred substantial expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the merger we will incur substantial expenses in connection with the proposed merger with ub bancorp which are charged to earnings as incurred if the merger is not completed these expenses will still be charged to earnings even though we would not have realized the expected benefits of the merger

provisions that could permit either or both parties to abandon the merger and terminate the merger agreement if the merger agreement is terminated there may be various adverse consequences to us for example since certain matters relating to the merger including business integration and data system conversion planning will require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management team our businesses may be adversely affected by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the merger without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the merger additionally if the merger agreement is terminated the market price of our common stock could decline to the extent that the current market prices reflect a market assumption that the merger will be completed we may not be able to compete successfully in ub bancorps market area our success in ub bancorps markets will depend in part on our ability to successfully offer products and services to customers that ub bancorp does not currently offer such as larger and more complex commercial loan financing transactions and syndications trust services sba loans investment advisory foreign exchange services derivatives assetbased lending lease financing debt and equity capital markets wealth management insurance brokerage securities brokerage and investment advisory and private lending this business strategy will require us to attract and retain qualified and experienced personnel to support those products and services we could lose existing customers or fail to acquire new customers in this market the merger may not be accretive and may be dilutive to our earnings per share which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock we currently expect the merger to be accretive to earnings per share in the first full calendar year after closing excluding onetime charges this expectation however is based on preliminary estimates which may materially change including the currently expected timing of the merger we may encounter additional transaction and integrationrelated costs or other factors such as a delay in the closing of the merger may fail to realize all of the benefits anticipated in the merger or may be subject to other factors that affect preliminary estimates or our ability to realize operational efficiencies any of these factors could cause a decrease in our earnings per share or decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the merger and contribute to a decrease in the price of our common stock our decisions regarding the credit risk associated with union banks loan portfolio could be incorrect and our credit mark may be inadequate which may adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of the combined company after the closing of the merger before signing the merger agreement we conducted extensive due diligence on a significant portion of the union bank loan portfolio however our review did not encompass every loan in the union bank loan portfolio in accordance with customary industry practices we evaluated the union bank loan portfolio based on various factors including among other things historical loss experience economic risks associated with each loan category volume and types of loans trends in classification volume and trends in delinquencies and nonaccruals and general economic conditions both local and national in this process our management made various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of the loan portfolio including the creditworthiness and financial condition of the borrowers the value of the real estate which is obtained from independent appraisers other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of the loans the existence of any guarantees and indemnifications and the economic environment in which the borrowers operate in addition the effects of probable decreases in expected principal cash flows on the union bank loans were considered as part of our evaluation if our assumptions and judgments turn out to be incorrect including as a result of the fact that our due diligence review did not cover each individual loan our estimated credit mark against the union bank loan portfolio in total may be insufficient to cover actual loan losses after the merger is completed and adjustments may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in the union bank loan portfolio additionally deterioration in economic conditions affecting borrowers new information regarding existing loans identification of additional problem loans and other factors both within and outside our or ub bancorps control may require an increase in the provision for credit losses material additions to the credit mark andor acl would materially decrease our net income and could result in extra regulatory scrutiny and possibly supervisory action
