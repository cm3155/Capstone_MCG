and unprecedented impact on a global scale while the us economy continues to recover from a brief but severe recession triggered by the covid19 pandemic its future effects are uncertain and it may be difficult to assess or predict the extent of the impacts of the pandemic on us as many factors are beyond our control and knowledge for a discussion of the risks we face with respect to the covid19 pandemic the associated economic uncertainty the steps taken to mitigate the pandemic and the resulting economic contraction see risk factors in part i of this annual report on form 10k this section includes a discussion of the significant areas of potential impact on us of the covid19 pandemic and specific actions we are taking or expect to take in this time of uncertainty financial results and outlook during the us economy showed strong recovery from a brief but severe recession in caused by the covid19 pandemic the easing of certain covid19 containment measures fostered economic expansion and government stimulus and disaster relief programs increased consumer liquidity which positively impacted credit performance and elevated payment rates for the year ended december net income was billion or per diluted share compared to billion or per diluted share for the prior year in comparing to the prior year we saw an increase in sales volume as well as increases in total loans and credit card loans we also reduced our allowance for credit losses at december as compared to december refer to loan quality provision and allowance for credit losses for more details on the current period allowance for credit losses for our outlook we expect loans to grow based on current expectations of sales trends and recent account growth further aided by an expected slight decline in payment rates net interest margin is expected to remain relatively flat to with some variability from quarter to quarter we expect the total net chargeoffs rate to increase due to credit normalization from historically low levels in we remain committed to disciplined expense management and will continue to make investments for profitable longterm growth regulatory and legislative federal state and local governments and independent banking agencies have taken extraordinary measures to support the us economy and mitigate the impacts of the covid19 pandemic on the economy and society at large these policies have included regulatory relief and flexibility to financial institutions liquidity to capital markets and financial support to businesses and consumers including fiscal stimulus payment forbearance small business lending programs increased unemployment payments and other forms of assistance lawmakers continue to offer proposals in an attempt to mitigate harm to the economy and consumers the ultimate impact of these programs and policies as well as from their expiration on our business results of operations and financial condition is difficult to quantify and may not be known for some time for more information see regulatory environment and developments below loan receivables and allowance for credit losses at the onset of the covid19 pandemic we continued to lend to customers but tightened our credit standards for new accounts and for growing existing accounts across all products in our loan portfolio additionally we temporarily reduced our customer acquisition and brand marketing in response to the significant economic downturn caused by the covid19 pandemic as a result of the strong credit performance observed and positive economic outlook we returned most of our underwriting criteria to prepandemic standards during the second quarter of additionally we increased our credit card and private student loan marketing and business development spend in the second third and fourth quarters of to support our loan growth initiatives in we decreased our allowance for credit losses in anticipation of lower credit losses driven by improving macroeconomic forecasts and continued stable credit performance our allowance for credit losses includes the risk associated with all loans and considers the effects of all loan modifications including troubled debt restructurings tdrs and loan modifications exempt from the tdr designation under the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act as of december the allowance for credit losses took into account our best estimate of the impact of both active and expired economic support and disaster relief programs put in place by federal and state governments and agencies to mitigate the economic impact of the covid19 pandemic it is unclear whether the measures employed to date are complete or whether federal and state governments and agencies may take additional actions that could impact our business for example president biden extended the freeze on federal student loan repayments to may while the expanded federal child tax credit and child and dependent care credit expired on december refer to loan quality for more details regarding these and other assumptions used to estimate the current period allowance for credit losses capital and liquidity as financial and capital markets conditions improved throughout we exercised prudent stewardship of our liquidity and deposit balances which grew rapidly at the onset of the pandemic credit spreads tightened materially and remained near recordlow levels as of december consequently we opportunistically issued billion of credit card assetbacked securities during the third quarter of we also diversified our funding channels by becoming a member of the fhlb chicago furthermore we acted to stem our deposit balance growth by spending less on marketing and lowering our deposit rates which helped return our liquidity portfolio balances to prepandemic levels by december we remain wellcapitalized with capital ratios in excess of regulatory minimums and took prudent actions to preserve and augment our capital when the macroeconomic and operating environment turned uncertain last year our capital levels allow us to return excess capital to shareholders through share repurchases and finance loan receivable growth as customers moderate loan payment rates and continue to increase spending as certain covid19 containment measures ease and the economy more fully recovers from the impacts of the covid19 pandemic payment services as governments across the world have taken steps to minimize the transmission of covid19 the number of crossborder transactions processed on the discover global network has declined certain negatively impacted categories such as travel may have an outsized impact on some of our diners club franchisees the impacts from the covid19 pandemic may result in lasting changes in consumer payment behaviors such as a shift from credit to debit a decline in the use of cash increasing online sales and rapid adoption of contactless payment as economic uncertainty persists these shifts may continue to result in changes to the payment services segments results of operations fair value and impairments with the uncertain nature of the pandemics overall impact on the economy we continue to assess the effects of covid19 with respect to our goodwill investment securities and other longterm assets see note goodwill and intangible assets to our consolidated financial statements for more information on the impact of the covid19 pandemic on intangible assets business continuity and operations we have managed the risk of covid19 by giving all nonessential employees the choice to work from home or to come into our physical locations with appropriate health and safety measures and capacity limitations notwithstanding the shift to workfromhome we have been able to successfully operate with no significant impact to our operations or service levels as a result upon the return to our physical locations we will offer flexible workfromhome arrangements that will provide our employees the option to work remotely on a more frequent basis than before the pandemic operational changes necessitated by the rapid shift in employee location have not thus far had a material adverse effect on us or our financial condition however the shift has caused us to grow increasingly dependent on thirdparty service providers including those with which we have no direct relationship such as our employees internet service providers for more information on the risks associated with reliance on thirdparty service providers and the shift to work from home see our risk factors disclosed in risk factors in part i of this annual report on form 10k regulatory environment and developments covid19 economic recovery as the us and global economies attempt to normalize from the covid19 pandemic the administration and banking agencies continue to evaluate whether additional actions are warranted to assist consumers financial institutions and the overall economy in addition the us congress has taken legislative action to address the economic disruptions caused by the covid19 pandemic including the march cares act and december omnibus and covid relief and response act additionally in march the american rescue plan act of arpa contained additional stimulus payments increased unemployment benefits and increased small business funding under the payment protection program the arpa also significantly increased and expanded the child tax credit for one year and provides additional funding for rental assistance programs these congressional efforts offered financial assistance and benefits to consumers and small businesses as the covid19 pandemic and recovery continues additional legislative and regulatory action may be proposed and could include provisions that significantly impact our prospects and business practices the impact of these legislative and regulatory initiatives on our business the economy and the us consumer will depend upon a wide variety of factors some of which are yet to be identified banking capital standards and stress testing as a bank holding company dfs is subject to mandatory supervisory stress tests every other year and is required to submit annual capital plans to the federal reserve based on forwardlooking internal analysis of income and capital levels under expected and stressful conditions dfs is also subject to capital buffer requirements including the stress capital buffer scb which requires maintenance of regulatory capital levels above a threshold established based on the results of supervisory stress tests after accounting for planned dividend payments due to economic uncertainty from the covid19 pandemic the federal reserve restricted capital distributions in and the beginning of following an announcement by the federal reserve on june these restrictions were lifted and effective june dfs was authorized to make capital distributions that are consistent with the federal reserves capital rule inclusive of dfs final scb requirement of that was previously announced by the federal reserve on august and that remained in effect until the conclusion of the comprehensive capital and analysis review ccar process and the subsequent related announcement of dfs adjusted scb requirement on january the federal reserve finalized regulatory amendments that made targeted changes to the capital planning regulatory reporting and scb requirements for firms subject to category iv standards including dfs to be consistent with the federal reserves regulatory tailoring framework the final rules generally align to instructions the federal reserve previously provided to category iv firms regarding their respective capital plan submissions the amended rules also provide category iv firms with the option to submit to supervisory stress tests during off years if they wish for the federal reserve to reset the stress test portion of their scb requirement in connection with the final rulemaking the federal reserve revised the scope of application of its existing regulatory guidance for capital planning to align with the tailoring framework however the timing and substance of any additional changes to existing guidance or new guidance are uncertain on june the federal reserve publicly announced the results of its supervisory stress tests for the firms required to participate in the ccar process in accordance with the capital plan rule amendments that were finalized in january dfs elected not to participate in the supervisory stress tests nevertheless dfs was required to submit a capital plan based on a forwardlooking internal assessment of income and capital under baseline and stressful conditions this plan was submitted by dfs to the federal reserve on april the federal reserve used our capital plan submission to assess its capital planning process and positions and on august announced dfs adjusted scb requirement of to reflect dfs planned common stock dividends this adjusted scb is effective as of october london interbank offered rate on july the uk financial conduct authority fca announced that it would no longer encourage or compel banks to continue to contribute quotes and maintain the london interbank offered rate libor after to support a smooth transition away from libor the federal reserve and the federal reserve bank of new york convened the alternative reference rates committee arrc a group of privatemarket participants tasked with facilitating a successful transition from us dollar usd libor to a more robust reference rate the arrc initially identified the secured overnight financing rate sofr as its recommended alternative reference rate for usd libor the arrc has also established several priorities and milestones to support the use of sofr and sofrbased indices including developing contractual fallback language for capital markets and consumer products providing clarity on legal tax accounting and regulatory matters promoting broad outreach and education efforts around the libor transition and recommending spread adjustments for sofr and sofrbased indices which will be of critical importance to market participants once usd libor settings cease in with regard to recent libor transition developments on march the fca announced the future cessation and loss of representativeness for all libor benchmark settings while nonusd and several less frequently referenced usd libor settings ceased publication immediately after december commonly referenced usd libor settings will cease publication immediately after june this future cessation event will trigger fallback provisions in many financial contracts to convert their benchmark index from libor to an alternative rate on july the arrc announced its recommendation of forwardlooking term rates based on sofr as additional alternative reference rate options on december the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb finalized a rule to facilitate transition from libor which is effective april specifically this final rule provides guidance on libor replacements and the libor transition for purposes of regulation z we have been communicating with the cfpb regarding our plans for the libor transition a crossfunctional team is overseeing and managing our transition away from the use of libor this team assesses evolving industry and marketplace norms and conventions for liborindexed instruments evaluates the impacts stemming from the future cessation of libor publication and oversees and takes actions to transition our libor exposures to alternative benchmark rates usually sofr our existing libor exposures are limited primarily to two instruments variablerate student loans and capital markets securities as of december liborindexed variablerate loans comprised approximately of our private student loan portfolio and approximately of our aggregate loan portfolio these outstanding student loans indexed to libor will convert to a sofr index in when 3month usd libor will no longer be published us banking regulators have directed banks to cease entering into new contracts that use usd libor as a reference rate after december therefore as of november we no longer originate new variablerate student loans indexed to libor instead new originations of such loans are indexed solely to 3month term sofr published by the chicago mercantile exchange cme we ceased entering into new liborindexed interest rate derivatives in and have since actively reduced libor exposures in our derivatives portfolio during the third quarter of we terminated our last liborindexed interest rate swap maturing after june our one remaining liborindexed interest rate swap matured in january most of our capital markets securities indexed to usd libor are floatingrate assetbacked securities beginning in we included fallback provisions in all newlyissued securities that will facilitate an orderly transition from libor to an appropriate reference rate which may be based on sofr once and 3month libor cease to be published after june approximately billion of our capital markets securities that mature after june with no fallback provisions would be covered under new york libor legislation or pending federal legislation which would preempt the new york libor legislation this legislation would allow us to replace the libor index with sofr under a safe harbor provision approximately million of our capital markets securities have a rate reset in august that contains a fallback provision that may not be covered under the new york libor legislation or the pending federal legislation however we may decide to exercise our right to call and redeem those securities on their reset date we have prepared for the cessation of usd libor by taking steps to avoid new exposures and actively reduce our remaining exposures we completed scheduled transition work before yearend including providing our stakeholders with information about the cessation of usd libor and how it will affect their contracts with us the transition process will continue through the end of consumer financial services the cfpb regulates consumer financial products and services and examines certain providers of consumer financial products and services including discover the cfpbs authority includes rulemaking supervisory and enforcement powers with respect to federal consumer protection laws preventing unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices and ensuring that consumers have access to fair transparent and competitive financial products and services historically the cfpbs policy priorities focused on several financial products of the type we offer eg credit cards and other consumer lending products in addition the cfpb is required by statute to undertake certain actions including its biennial review of the consumer credit card market former federal trade commissioner rohit chopra was sworn in as the director of the cfpb on october under director chopras leadership the cfpbs priorities are expected to focus on among other things increased enforcement of existing consumer protection laws with a particular focus on unfair deceptive and abusive acts and practices and fair lending student lending and servicing debt collection and credit reporting additionally the cfpb released an inquiry on fees charged to consumers for financial products including credit cards and banking products enhanced regulatory requirements potential supervisory findings or enforcement actions and ratings could negatively impact our ability to implement certain consumerfocused enhancements to product features and functionality and business strategies limit or change our business practices limit our consumer product offerings cause us to invest more management time and resources in compliance efforts or limit our ability to obtain related required regulatory approvals the additional expense time and resources needed to comply with ongoing or new regulatory requirements may adversely impact the cost of and access to credit for consumers and results of business operations in december certain of our subsidiaries entered into a consent order with the cfpb regarding identified private student loan servicing practices see note litigation and regulatory matters to our consolidated financial statements for more information data security and privacy policymakers at the federal and state levels remain focused on enhancing data security and data breach incident response requirements furthermore regulations and legislation at various levels of government have been proposed and enacted to augment consumer data privacy standards the california consumer privacy act ccpa creates a broad set of privacy rights and remedies modeled in part on the european unions general data protection regulation the ccpa went into effect on january and the california attorney generals final regulations became effective on august with enforcement beginning july the california privacy rights act cpra a ballot measure led by the original proponent of the ccpa passed on november and largely enters into force on january the cpra replaces the ccpa to enhance consumer privacy protections further and creates a new california privacy protection agency cppa in september the cppa board initiated the cpra regulatory phase by issuing a request for preliminary comments while the cpra retains an exemption for information collected processed sold or disclosed subject to the grammleachbliley act we continue to evaluate the impact of the cpra on our businesses and other providers of consumer financial services environmental social and governance matters environmental social and governance esg issues including climate change human capital and governance practices are a significant area of focus by lawmakers regulatory agencies shareholders and other stakeholders proposed legislation and rulemakings have been issued or are being considered including proposals to require disclosure of climate and other esg metrics and risks the potential impact to us of these legislative and regulatory developments is uncertain at this time results of operations the discussion below provides a summary of our results of operations and information about our loan receivables as of and for the year ended december compared to the year ended december refer to our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december for discussion of our results of operations and loan

sales net of returns digital banking our digital banking segment reported pretax income of billion for the year ended december as compared to billion for the year ended december net interest income increased for the year ended december as compared to the year ended december primarily driven by lower funding costs partially offset by a lower average level of outstanding loan receivables and lower yields on loans interest income decreased over prior year primarily due to a lower average level of card loan receivables driven by higher payment rates as well as lower yields on loans due to lower market rates interest expense decreased compared to the prior year due to a decrease in deposit pricing lower costs associated with declines in average market rates a lower level of funding requirements a shift in the mix to lower cost funding and higher coupon maturities for the year ended december the provision for credit losses decreased as compared to the year ended december primarily due to a reserve release in the current period compared to a reserve build in the prior period and lower net chargeoffs the reserve release during the year ended december was primarily driven by improvements in the macroeconomic forecast and continued stable credit performance partially offset by modest credit card loan receivables growth during the period the reserve build during the year ended december was primarily due to the unfavorable change in economic outlook resulting from the covid19 pandemic for a detailed discussion on provision for credit losses see loan quality provision and allowance for credit losses total other income for the digital banking segment increased for the year ended december as compared to the year ended december due to an increase in discount and interchange revenue the increase in discount and interchange revenue was partially offset by an increase in rewards costs both of which were the result of higher sales volume total other expense increased for the year ended december as compared to the year ended december primarily due to increases in marketing and business development employee compensation and benefits and professional fees marketing and business development increased due to growth investments primarily in card and increased brand marketing employee compensation and benefits increased as a result of higher bonus accruals and higher average salaries partially offset by lower headcount the professional fees increase was driven primarily by an increase in recovery fees discover card sales volume was billion for the year ended december which was an increase of as compared to the year ended december this volume growth was primarily driven by higher consumer spending across all spending categories reflecting the easing of covid19 restrictions continued economic expansion and government stimulus programs payment services our payment services segment reported pretax income of million for the year ended december as compared to pretax income of million for the year ended december the increase in segment pretax income was primarily due to unrealized gains on equity investments unrealized gains on equity investments are the result of investments in payment services entities that are carried at fair value because the shares are actively traded the increase was partially offset by the existence of realized gains on equity investments in the prior year but not in the current year critical accounting estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap management must make judgments and use estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are uncertain for estimates that involve a high degree of judgment and subjectivity it is possible that different estimates could reasonably be derived for the same period for estimates that are particularly sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions significant changes to the estimated amount from period to period are also possible management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate however if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts in our consolidated financial statements the resulting changes could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and in certain cases could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition management has identified the estimates related to our allowance for credit losses as a critical accounting estimate allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses was billion at december which reflects a billion release from the amount of the allowance for credit losses at december the allowance for credit losses represents managements estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of our financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain offbalance sheet loan commitments changes in the allowance for credit losses and in the related provision for credit losses can materially affect net income in estimating the expected credit losses we use a combination of statisticallybased models and qualitative analysis there is a significant amount of judgment applied in selecting inputs and analyzing the results produced to estimate the allowance for credit losses for more information on these judgments and our accounting policies and methodologies used to determine the allowance for credit losses see loan quality note loan receivables and note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements one of the key assumptions requiring significant judgment in estimating the current expected credit losses on a quarterly basis is the determination of the macroeconomic forecasts used in the loss forecast models for the reasonable and supportable loss forecast period we consider forecasts of multiple economic scenarios that generally include a base scenario with one or more optimistic upside or pessimistic downside scenarios these scenarios incorporate a variety of macroeconomic variables including annualized gross domestic product growth and unemployment rate the scenarios that are chosen each quarter and the amount of weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors including recent economic events leading economic indicators views of internal and thirdparty economists and industry trends assumptions about the macroeconomic environment are inherently uncertain and as a result actual changes in the allowance for credit losses may be different from the simulated scenario presented below to demonstrate the sensitivity of the estimated credit losses to the macroeconomic scenarios we compared the modeled credit losses determined using our base and one or more adverse macroeconomic scenarios if we applied weight to the most adverse scenario in our sensitivity analysis to reflect the economic deterioration from the resurgence of covid19 and resulting economic restrictions our allowance for credit losses would increase by approximately million at december the sensitivity disclosed above is hypothetical it is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one factor or input such as the weighting of macroeconomic forecasts might affect the overall allowance for credit losses because we consider a variety of factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit losses the macroeconomic scenarios used are constructed with interrelated projections of multiple economic variables and loss estimates are produced that consider the historical correlation of those economic variables with credit losses the inputs in the macroeconomic scenarios may not change at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types and changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent such that improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration in others as a result the sensitivity analysis above does not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the allowance for credit losses it is intended to provide insights into the impact of different judgments about the economy on our modeled loss estimates for the loan portfolio and does not imply any expectation of future losses furthermore the hypothetical increase in our allowance for credit losses for loans does not incorporate the impact of management judgment for qualitative factors applied in the current allowance for credit losses which may have a positive or negative effect on the results the overall economic environment directly impacts the macroeconomic variables that are used in the loss forecast models if management used different assumptions about the economic environment in estimating expected credit losses the impact to the allowance for credit losses could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in addition if we experience a rapidly changing economic environment as experienced recently under the covid19 pandemic the uncertainty around the credit loss forecasts may increase both due to the uncertainty of the economic forecasts and the challenges our models may have in incorporating them earnings summary the following table outlines changes in our consolidated statements of income dollars in millions table start

the economy have significantly affected our sales volume and credit card loan growth we tightened credit standards for new accounts and for growing existing accounts across all products and reduced our marketing and customer acquisition expenditures at the onset of the pandemic due to the strong economic recovery from the covid19 pandemicinduced recession we returned most of our underwriting criteria to prepandemic standards and resumed our investment in marketing and business development during the second quarter of this change in our credit underwriting in addition to changes in consumer spending behavior increased marketing and the reopening of the us economy upon the easing of certain covid19 containment measures contributed to an increase in sales volume for the year ended december when compared to the year ended december as a result our outstanding credit card loan receivables as of december increased when compared to december additionally higher seasonal consumer spending and payment patterns around the winter holidays contributed to an increase in our ending outstanding loan receivables the credit card loan receivables growth during the period was partially offset by elevated payment rates resulting from government stimulus and disaster relief programs at the onset of the covid19 pandemic we expanded borrower relief offerings to include skipapay payment deferral sap and other loan modification programs complementing the assistance already available through our existing loan modification programs on august we ceased offering enrollments in the sap and other loan modification programs specifically developed in response to the covid19 pandemic the accounts using these modifications as a result of the covid19 pandemic were evaluated for potential exclusion from the tdr designation either due to the insignificance of the concession or because they qualified for an exemption pursuant to the cares act the sap programs provided only an insignificant delay in payment on the enrolled accounts or loans and therefore those deferrals were not classified as tdrs section of the cares act provided certain financial institutions with the option to suspend the application of accounting and reporting guidance for tdrs for a limited period of time for loan modifications made to address the effects of the covid19 pandemic section 541of the omnibus and covid relief and response act extended the tdr accounting and reporting relief provided by the cares act through the earlier of january or the date that is days after the termination of the presidentiallydeclared national emergency we elected to apply the option to suspend the application of accounting and reporting guidance for tdrs as provided under section of the cares act and as subsequently extended as such the number of accounts and corresponding balances designated as a tdr for the year ended december has been favorably impacted by the exclusion of certain modifications from the tdr designation pursuant to these exemptions and were lower than they otherwise would have been the payment status of modified accounts excluded from the tdr designation pursuant to the cares act is reflected in our delinquency reporting section of the cares act expired on january upon expiration the characterization of modified accounts that were exempt from the tdr designation pursuant to section of the cares act is not reconsidered accordingly these accounts continue to be exempt from the tdr designation unless a subsequent modification is made loan modifications made subsequent to the expiration of section are evaluated under gaap to determine whether the tdr designation applies based on the cumulative length of the concession period and credit quality of the borrower the table

including the combined total of those identified as tdrs and those exempt from the tdr designation decreased during the year ended december when compared to the same period in the decrease is primarily due to the impacts of government stimulus and disaster relief programs which reduced the need for our customers to enroll in a loan modification program the number and balance of loan modifications across all products including the combined total of those identified as tdrs and those exempt from the tdr designation during the year ended december were favorably impacted by the utilization of sap programs in lieu of traditional loan modification programs additionally enrollments in personal loan modification programs were favorably impacted by tighter underwriting standards

maintaining the allowance for credit losses at an appropriate level to absorb the estimate of credit losses anticipated over the remaining expected life of loan receivables at each period end date in deriving the estimate of expected credit losses we consider the collectability of principal interest and fees associated with our loan receivables we also consider expected recoveries of amounts that were either previously chargedoff or are expected to be chargedoff establishing the estimate for expected credit losses requires significant management judgment the factors that influence the provision for credit losses include increases or decreases in outstanding loan balances including changes in consumer spending payment and credit utilization behaviors the level of originations and maturities and changes in the overall mix of accounts and products within the portfolio the credit quality of the loan portfolio which reflects our credit granting practices and the effectiveness of collection efforts among other factors the impact of general economic conditions on the consumer including national and regional conditions unemployment levels bankruptcy trends and interest rate

adjustment to the allowance for credit losses as a result of the adoption of asu no on january prior to the adoption of asu no on january net chargeoffs on purchased creditdeteriorated pcd loans generally did not result in a change to earnings net change in reserves on pcd pools having no remaining nonaccretable difference prior to adoption of asu no on january the allowance for credit losses was approximately billion at december which reflects a billion release from the amount of the allowance for credit losses at december the release in the allowance for credit losses between december and december was primarily driven by improvements in the macroeconomic forecast and continued stable credit performance partially offset by modest credit card loan receivables growth during the period the increase in credit card loan receivables was driven by the robust sales trends during the period as covid19 restrictions continue to ease and the us economy continues to more fully reopen the loan receivables growth during the period was partially offset by elevated payment rates resulting from government stimulus and disaster relief programs in estimating the allowance at december we used a macroeconomic forecast that projected i a peak unemployment rate of decreasing to by the end of with slow improvement over the next few years and ii annualized growth in the real gross domestic product in labor market conditions which historically have been an important determinant of credit loss trends continued to improve as of december despite the spread of the delta and omicron variants of covid19 while initial jobless claims have returned to prepandemic levels continuing unemployment claims and the unemployment rate remain moderately elevated relative to prepandemic levels as of december in estimating expected credit losses we considered the uncertainties associated with borrower behavior payment trends and credit performance subsequent to the expiration of government stimulus programs such as the cares act and arpa and disaster relief programs such as foreclosure moratoriums and federal student loan and mortgage payment forbearance during the third and fourth quarters of several disaster relief programs expired or were rescinded entirely as the governments response to the pandemic wanes and the economy continues to experience aspects of stress resulting from the pandemic there is uncertainty regarding the sustainability of the recent credit quality trends in our loan receivables portfolio accordingly the estimation of the allowance for credit losses has required significant management judgment the forecast period we deemed to be reasonable and supportable was months for all periods presented except march where the forecast period was months due to the uncertainty caused by the rapidly changing economic environment experienced at the onset of the covid19 pandemic the 18month reasonable and supportable forecast period was deemed appropriate based on the observed stability of the economic outlook and relative consistency among the macroeconomic forecasts for all periods presented we determined that a reversion period of months was appropriate for similar reasons due to the uncertainties associated with borrower behavior resulting from government stimulus and disaster relief programs we applied a weighted reversion method to provide a more reasonable transition to historical losses for all loan products for all periods presented with the following exceptions at march and december we applied a straightline method for all loan products at june we applied a weighted reversion method for credit card loans and a straightline method for all other loan products the provision for credit losses is the amount of expense realized after considering the level of net chargeoffs in the period and the required amount of allowance for credit losses at the balance sheet date for the year ended december the provision for credit losses decreased by billion or as compared to the year ended december the decrease is due to a reserve release in the current period compared to a reserve build in the prior period and lower net chargeoffs the reserve release during the year ended december was primarily driven by improvements in the macroeconomic forecast and continued stable credit performance offset by modest credit card loan receivables growth during the period the reserve build during the year ended december was primarily due to the unfavorable change in economic outlook resulting from the covid19 pandemic net chargeoffs our net chargeoffs include the principal amount of losses charged off less principal recoveries and exclude chargedoff and recovered interest and fees and fraud losses chargedoff and recovered interest and fees are recorded in interest income and loan fee income respectively which is effectively a reclassification of the provision for credit losses while fraud losses are recorded in other expense the following table presents amounts and rates of net chargeoffs of key loan products dollars in millions table start for the years ended december credit card loans private student loans personal loans table end prior to adoption of asu no on january net chargeoffs on pcd loans generally did not result in a charge to earnings the net chargeoffs and chargeoff rate on our credit card loans for the year ended december decreased when compared to the year ended december primarily due to a decrease in the number of delinquent loans and lower average balances chargedoff these factors are a result of the impacts of government stimulus and disaster relief programs the net chargeoffs and net chargeoff rate on private student loans for the year ended december remained relatively flat when compared to the year ended december the net chargeoffs and net chargeoff rate on personal loans for the year ended december decreased when compared to the year ended december due to the impacts of government stimulus and disaster relief programs and tighter underwriting standards that were implemented in early delinquencies delinquencies are an indicator of credit quality at a point in time a loan balance is considered delinquent when contractual payments on the loan become days past due the following table presents the amounts and delinquency rates of key loan products that are and days or more delinquent loan receivables that are not accruing interest regardless of delinquency and loans restructured in tdr programs dollars in millions table start december loans or

student and personal loans that were or more days delinquent at december and the respective amounts associated with modifications exempt from the tdr designation under the cares act were immaterial we estimate that interest income recognized on credit card loans restructured in tdr programs was million million and million for the years ended december and respectively we do not separately track interest income on loans in tdr programs we estimate this amount by applying an average interest rate to the average loans in the various tdr programs we estimate that the incremental interest income that would have been recorded in accordance with the original terms of credit card loans restructured in tdr programs was million million and million for the years ended december and respectively we do not separately track the amount of incremental interest income that would have been recorded if the loans in tdr programs had not been restructured and interest had instead been recorded in accordance with the original terms we estimate this amount by applying the difference between the average interest rate earned on nonmodified loans and the average interest rate earned on loans in the tdr programs to the average loans in the tdr programs credit card loans restructured in tdr programs include million million and million at december and respectively which are also included in loans or more days delinquent private student loans restructured in tdr programs include million million and million at december and respectively which are also included in loans or more days delinquent personal loans restructured in tdr programs include million million and million at december and respectively which are also included in loans or more days delinquent the 30day and 90day delinquency rates in the table above include all loans including tdrs modified loans exempt from tdr status and prior modifications that are no longer required to be reported as tdrs the 30day and 90day delinquency rates for credit card and personal loans at december decreased compared to december primarily due to the impacts of government stimulus and disaster relief programs the 30day and 90day delinquency rates for personal loans were favorably impacted by tighter underwriting standards that were implemented in early the 30day and 90day delinquency rates for private student loans increased at december compared to december the increase was due to the payment relief provided by sap and other payment programs in late that drove delinquency rates lower at december as accounts enrolled in the sap program did not advance through the delinquency cycle the balance of credit card private student and personal loans reported as tdrs decreased at december as compared to december due to elevated payment rates resulting from government stimulus and disaster relief programs the balance of credit card and private student loans reported as tdrs also benefited from the exclusion of accounts qualifying for the exemption from the tdr designation pursuant to the cares act which expired on january upon expiration the characterization of modified accounts that were exempt from the tdr designation pursuant to section of the cares act is not reconsidered accordingly these accounts continue to be exempt from the balance of loans reported as tdrs unless a subsequent modification is made loan modifications made subsequent to the expiration of section are evaluated under gaap to determine whether the tdr designation applies based on the cumulative length of the concession period and credit quality of the borrower the balance of personal loans reported as tdrs was also favorably impacted by tighter underwriting standards that were implemented in early which resulted in fewer enrollments in loan modification programs the following table provides the balance of loan receivables restructured through a temporary loan modification program that were exempt from the tdr designation pursuant to the cares act dollars in millions table start december credit card loans private student loans personal loans table end we believe loan modification programs are useful in

income increased million for the year ended december as compared to the year ended december which was primarily due to unrealized gains on equity investments and an increase in net discount and interchange revenue unrealized gains on equity investments are the result of investments in payment services entities that are carried at fair value because the shares are actively traded the increase in discount and interchange revenue was partially offset by an increase in rewards costs both of which were the result of higher sales volume the increase in total other income was partially offset by

income tax expense was primarily driven by an increase in pretax income the effective tax rate increased primarily due to tax credits having a lower rate benefit on higher pretax income liquidity and capital resources impact of the covid19 pandemic on liquidity and capital the us recorded strong real gdp growth during as it recovered from a brief but severe recession in caused by the covid19 pandemic labor market conditions also improved considerably as the unemployment rate fell more than two percentage points and job openings exceeded the number of unemployed workers for much of the year in response to improved economic conditions and higher inflation rates the federal reserve has begun to alter its monetary policy by reducing its monthly asset purchases we remain wellcapitalized with capital ratios in excess of regulatory minimums and our own internal targets and maintain ample capital to finance loan receivable growth to deploy excess capital we resumed our common stock repurchase program during the first quarter of repurchasing billion of our common stock during the year ended december as financial and capital markets conditions improved throughout we exercised prudent stewardship of our liquidity and deposit balances which grew rapidly at the onset of the pandemic credit spreads tightened materially and remained near recordlow levels as of december consequently we opportunistically issued billion of credit card assetbacked securities during the third quarter of we also diversified our funding channels by becoming a member of the fhlb chicago furthermore we acted to stem our deposit balance growth by spending less on marketing and lowering our deposit rates which helped return our liquidity portfolio balances to prepandemic levels by december funding and liquidity we seek to maintain stable diversified and costeffective funding sources and a strong liquidity profile to fund our business and repay or refinance our maturing obligations under normal operating conditions and periods of economic or financial stress in managing our liquidity risk we seek to maintain a prudent liability maturity profile and ready access to an ample store of primary and contingent liquidity sources our primary funding sources include directtoconsumer and brokered deposits public term assetbacked securitizations and other shortterm and longterm borrowings our primary liquidity sources include a portfolio composed of highly liquid unencumbered assets including cash and cash equivalents and investment securities as well as secured borrowing capacity through private term assetbacked securitizations and federal home loan bank fhlb advances in addition we have unused borrowing capacity at the federal reserve discount window which provides another source of contingent liquidity funding sources deposits we offer deposit products to customers through two channels i direct marketing internet origination and affinity relationships directtoconsumer deposits and ii contractual arrangements with securities brokerage firms brokered deposits directtoconsumer deposits include online savings accounts certificates of deposit money market accounts ira savings accounts ira certificates of deposit and checkingdebit accounts brokered deposits include certificates of deposit and sweep accounts in december the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic issued the final rule on revisions to its brokered deposits regulations in accordance with this final rule our regulatory reporting reflects the changes required to deposit categorizations specifically certain retail deposit products such as affinity deposits and deposits generated through certain sweep deposit relationships will no longer be categorized as brokered for regulatory reporting purposes at december we had billion of directtoconsumer deposits and billion of brokered deposits of which there are billion of deposit balances due in less than one year and billion of deposit balances due in one year or thereafter credit card securitization financing we securitize credit card receivables as a source of funding we access the assetbacked securitization market using the discover card master trust i dcmt and the discover card execution note trust dcent in connection with our securitization transactions credit card receivables are transferred to dcmt dcmt has issued a certificate representing the beneficial interest in its credit card receivables to dcent we issue dcent discoverseries notes in public and private transactions which are collateralized by the beneficial interest certificate held by dcent from time to time we may add credit card receivables to dcmt to create sufficient funding capacity for future securitizations while managing sellers interest we retain significant exposure to the performance of the securitized credit card receivables through holding the sellers interest and subordinated classes of dcent discoverseries notes at december we had billion of outstanding public assetbacked securities and billion of outstanding subordinated assetbacked securities that had been issued to our whollyowned subsidiaries the securitization structures include certain features designed to protect investors the primary feature relates to the availability and adequacy of cash flows in the securitized pool of receivables to meet contractual requirements the insufficiency of which triggers early repayment of the securities we refer to this as economic early amortization which is based on excess spread levels excess spread is the amount by which income received with respect to the securitized credit card receivables during a collection period including interest collections fees and interchange exceeds the fees and expenses of dcent during such collection period including interest expense servicing fees and chargedoff receivables in the event of an economic early amortization which would occur if the excess spread fell below on a threemonth rolling average basis we would be required to repay all outstanding securitized borrowings using available collections received with respect to the securitized credit card receivables for the three months ended december the discoverseries threemonth rolling average excess spread was the period of ultimate repayment would be determined by the amount and timing of collections received through our whollyowned indirect subsidiary discover funding llc we are required to maintain an interest in a contractual minimum level of receivables in dcmt in excess of the face value of outstanding investors interests this minimum interest is referred to as the minimum sellers interest the required minimum sellers interest in the pool of trust receivables is approximately in excess of the total investors interests which includes interests held by third parties as well as those interests held by us if the level of receivables in dcmt were to fall below the required minimum we would be required to add receivables from the unrestricted pool of receivables which would increase the amount of credit card receivables restricted for securitization investors a decline in the amount of the excess sellers interest could occur if balance repayments and charge offs exceeded new lending on the securitized accounts or as a result of changes in total outstanding investors interests sellers interest exhibits seasonality as higher receivable balance repayments tend to occur in the first calendar year quarter if we could not add enough receivables to satisfy the minimum sellers interest requirement an early amortization or repayment of investors interests would be triggered an early amortization event would impair our liquidity and may require us to utilize our available nonsecuritization related contingent liquidity or rely on alternative funding sources which may or may not be available at the time we have several strategies we can deploy to prevent an early amortization event for instance we could add receivables to dcmt which would reduce our available borrowing capacity at the federal reserve discount window as of december there were billion of credit card receivables in the trust and no accounts were added to those restricted for securitization investors for the year ended december alternatively we could employ structured discounting which was used effectively in to bolster excess spread and mitigate early amortization risk the following table summarizes expected contractual maturities of the investors interests in credit card securitizations excluding those that have been issued to our whollyowned subsidiaries dollars in millions table start at december total less than one year one year and thereafter scheduled maturities of borrowings owed to credit card securitization investors table end the aaasf and aaasf ratings of the dcent discoverseries class a notes issued to date have been based in part on an fdic rule which created a safe harbor that provides that the fdic as conservator or receiver will not use its power to disaffirm or repudiate contracts seek to reclaim or recover assets transferred in connection with a securitization or recharacterize assets transferred in connection with a securitization as assets of the insured depository institution provided such transfer satisfies the conditions for sale accounting treatment under previous gaap although the implementation of financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification topic transfers and servicing no longer qualified certain transfers of assets for sale accounting treatment the fdic approved a final rule that preserved the safeharbor treatment applicable to revolving trusts and master trusts including dcmt so long as those trusts would have satisfied the original fdic safe harbor if evaluated under gaap pertaining to transfers of financial assets in effect prior to december however other legislative and regulatory developments may impact our ability or desire to issue assetbacked securities in the future federal home loan bank advances discover bank is a member bank of the fhlb of chicago one of fhlbs that along with the office of finance compose the fhlb system the fhlbs are governmentsponsored enterprises of the us us gses chartered to improve the availability of funds to support home ownership as such senior debt obligations of the fhlbs feature the same credit ratings as us treasury securities and are considered highquality liquid assets for bank regulatory purposes consequently the fhlbs benefit from consistent capital market access during nearly all macroeconomic and financial market conditions and low funding costs which they pass on to their member banks when they borrow advances thus we consider fhlb advances a stable and reliable funding source for discover bank for shortterm contingent liquidity and longterm assetliability management as a member of the fhlb of chicago discover bank has access to short and longterm advance structures with maturities ranging from overnight to years as of december we had total committed borrowing capacity of billion based on the amount and type of assets pledged of which billion of shortterm advances were outstanding with the fhlb of chicago to meet

our regular funding strategy we may from time to time borrow shortterm funds in the federal funds market or the repurchase repo market through repurchase agreements federal funds are shortterm unsecured loans between banks or other financial entities with a federal reserve account funds borrowed in the repo market are shortterm collateralized loans usually secured with highlyrated investment securities such as us treasury bills or notes or mortgage bonds or debentures issued by government agencies or us gses at december there were no outstanding balances in the federal funds market or under repurchase agreements additionally we have access to shortterm advance structures through the fhlb of chicago and privately placed assetbacked securitizations at december there were billion and million of shortterm advances outstanding from the fhlb and private assetbacked securitizations respectively additional funding sources private assetbacked securitizations we have access to committed borrowing capacity through privately placed assetbacked securitizations while we may utilize funding from these private securitizations from time to time for normal business operations their committed nature also makes them a reliable contingency funding source therefore we reserve some undrawn capacity informed by our liquidity stress test results for potential contingency funding needs at december we had a total committed capacity of billion million of which was drawn to meet seasonal funding needs we seek to ensure the stability and reliability of these securitizations by staggering their maturity dates renewing them approximately one year prior to their scheduled maturity dates and periodically drawing them for operational tests and seasonal funding needs federal reserve discover bank has access to the federal reserve bank of philadelphias discount window as of december discover bank had billion of available borrowing capacity through the discount window based on the amount and type of assets pledged primarily consumer loans as of december we have no borrowings outstanding under the discount window and reserve this capacity as a source of contingent liquidity funding uses our primary uses of funds include the extensions of loans and credit to customers primarily through discover bank the maintenance of sufficient working capital for routine operations the service of our debt and capital obligations including interest principal and dividend payments and the purchase of investment securities for our liquidity portfolio in addition to originating consumer loans to new customers we also extend credit to existing customers which primarily arises from agreements for unused lines of credit on certain credit cards and certain other loan products provided there is no violation of conditions established in the related agreement at december our unused credit arrangements were approximately billion these arrangements substantially all of which we can terminate at any time and which do not necessarily represent future cash requirements are periodically reviewed based on account usage customer creditworthiness and loan qualification in the normal course of business we enter into various contracts for goods and services such as consulting outsourcing data sponsorships software licenses telecommunications global merchant acceptance and cashback rewards among other things these contracts are legally binding and specify all significant terms including any applicable fixed future cash payments as of december we have debt obligations common stock and preferred stock outstanding refer to funding sources and capital for more information related to our debt obligations and capital service respectively and the timing of expected payments we assess funding uses and liquidity needs under stressed and normal operating conditions considering primary uses of funding such as onbalance sheet loans and contingent uses of funding such as the need to post additional collateral for derivatives positions to anticipate funding needs under stress we conduct liquidity stress tests to assess the impact of idiosyncratic systemic and hybrid ie idiosyncratic and systemic scenarios with varying levels of liquidity risk reflecting a range of stress severity if we determine we have excess cash and cash equivalents we may

and satisfy debt obligations under stressed and normal operating conditions in addition to the funding sources discussed in the previous section we also maintain highly liquid unencumbered assets in our liquidity portfolio that we expect to be able to convert to cash quickly and with little loss of value using either the repo market or outright sales we maintain a liquidity risk and funding management policy which outlines the overall framework and general principles we follow in managing liquidity risk across our business the board of directors approves the policy and the asset and liability management committee the alco is responsible for its implementation additionally we maintain a liquidity management framework document that outlines the general strategies objectives and principles we utilize to manage our liquidity position and the various liquidity risks inherent in our business model we seek to balance the tradeoffs between maintaining too much liquidity which may be costly with having too little liquidity which could cause financial distress the alco chaired by our treasurer has crossfunctional membership and manages liquidity risk centrally the alco monitors the liquidity risk profiles of dfs and discover bank and oversees any actions corporate treasury may take to ensure that we maintain ready access to our funding sources and sufficient liquidity to meet current and projected needs in addition the alco and our board of directors regularly review our compliance with our liquidity limits at dfs and discover bank which are established in accordance with the liquidity risk appetite set by our board of directors we employ a variety of metrics to monitor and manage liquidity we utilize early warning indicators ewis to detect emerging liquidity stress events and a reporting and escalation process designed to be consistent with regulatory guidance the ewis include both idiosyncratic and systemic measures and are monitored daily and reported to the alco regularly a warning from one or more of these indicators triggers prompt review and decisionmaking by our senior management team and in certain instances may lead to the convening of a seniorlevel response team and activation of our contingency funding plan in addition we conduct liquidity stress tests regularly and ensure contingency funding is in place to address potential liquidity shortfalls we evaluate a range of stress scenarios that are designed according to regulatory requirements including idiosyncratic systemic and a combination of such events that could impact funding sources and our ability to meet liquidity needs these scenarios measure the projected liquidity position at dfs and discover bank across a range of time horizons by comparing estimated contingency funding needs to available contingent liquidity our primary contingent liquidity sources include our liquidity portfolio securities which we could sell repo or borrow against and private securitizations with unused borrowing capacity in addition we could borrow fhlb advances by pledging securities to the fhlb of chicago moreover we have unused borrowing capacity with the federal reserve discount window which provides an additional source of contingent liquidity we seek to maintain sufficient liquidity to satisfy all maturing obligations and fund business operations for at least months in a severe stress environment in such an environment we may also take actions to curtail the size of our balance sheet which would reduce the need for funding and liquidity at december our liquidity portfolio is composed of highly liquid unencumbered assets including cash and cash equivalents and investment securities cash and cash equivalents were primarily deposits with the
