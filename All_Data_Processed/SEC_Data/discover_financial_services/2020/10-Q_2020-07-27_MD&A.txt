of this quarterly report and in risk factors business competition business supervision and regulation and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report on s policy changes and forecasting uncertainties given the same information others may reach different reasonable estimates the key assumptions requiring significant judgment in the allowance for credit losses estimate on a quarterly basis include determination of the lengths of the reasonable and supportable forecast and reversion periods as well as the macroeconomic variables selected for use in loss forecast models the lengths of the reasonable and supportable forecast and reversion periods can vary and are subject to a quarterly assessment that considers the economic outlook and level of variability among macroeconomic forecasts generally a straightline method is used to revert from the reasonable and supportable forecast period to the postreversion period but in certain stressed scenarios a weighted approach may be deemed more appropriate the specific macroeconomic variables most significant to the loss forecast models may change over time but generally include measures of consumer indebtedness unemployment personal income and housingrelated metrics the overall economic environment directly impacts both the reasonable and supportable forecast and reversion periods as well as the macroeconomic variables that are used in the loss forecast models if management used different assumptions about the economic environment in estimating expected credit losses the impact to the allowance for credit losses could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in addition if we experience a rapidly changing economic environment as experienced recently under the covid19 pandemic the uncertainty around the credit loss forecasts may increase both due to the uncertainty of the economic forecasts and the challenges our models may have in incorporating them although the estimation process is broader than any single macroeconomic variable some variables have a more significant impact on the allowance for credit losses estimate one example is a macroeconomic forecast reflecting a basis point change in the unemployment rate variable which could move the card allowance for credit losses estimate by approximately million see loan quality and note loan receivables to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further details about our allowance for credit losses earnings summary the

a percentage of average total loan receivables and net yield on interestearning assets net interest income as a percentage of average total interestearning assets we also separately consider the impact of the level of loan receivables and the related interest yield and the impact of the cost of funds related to each of our funding sources along with the income generated by our liquidity portfolio on net interest income our interestearning assets consist of i cash and cash equivalents primarily related to amounts on deposit with the federal reserve bank of philadelphia ii restricted cash iii other shortterm investments iv investment securities and v loan receivables our interestbearing liabilities consist primarily of deposits both directtoconsumer and brokered and longterm borrowings including amounts owed to securitization investors net interest income is influenced by the following the level and composition of loan receivables including the proportion of credit card loans to other loans as well as the proportion of loan receivables bearing interest at promotional rates as compared to standard rates the credit performance of our loans particularly with regard to chargeoffs of finance charges which reduce interest income the terms of longterm borrowings and certificates of deposit upon initial offering including maturity and interest rate the interest rates

libor and the effectiveness of interest rate swaps in our interest rate risk management program net interest income decreased for the three and six months ended june as compared to the same periods in primarily driven by lower yields on credit card loans partially offset by lower funding costs interest income decreased during the three and six months ended june as compared to the same periods in as a result of lower yields on credit card loans which was the result of lower market rates interest expense decreased during the three and six months ended june as compared to the same periods in due to

loan quality impact of covid19 on loan quality covid19 and its impact to the economy has had a significant effect on our sales volume and loan growth during the first half of also while we continue to lend to customers we have tightened standards for new accounts and for growing existing accounts we continue to provide support to our customers impacted by covid19 in response to the pandemic to complement the assistance already available through our existing programs we expanded borrower relief offerings to also include skipapay programs and other loan modifications the accounts using these modifications are generally excluded from tdr status either because the concessions are insignificant or they qualify for exemption pursuant to the cares act or interagency guidance as of june we have enrolled approximately thousand customers and billion in receivables in skipapay programs in total of those customers and receivables thousand and billion respectively were still enrolled at quarterend we have seen skipapay enrollments in our card portfolio steadily decrease after peak enrollment during the first week of april the utilization of skipapay programs has had a favorable impact on reported credit performance because pursuant to regulatory guidelines accounts enrolled in the programs do not advance through delinquency cycles in the same time frame as would have occurred without the programs specifically current accounts enrolled in the programs do not advance to delinquency and delinquent accounts enrolled in the programs do not advance to the next delinquency cycle or to chargeoff at june our delinquency ratios have been favorably impacted by customer usage of the skipapay programs and are lower than comparative periods as a result additionally due to relief provided by the cares act or interagency guidance certain customer accounts entering loan modification programs during the pandemic were excluded from being reported as tdrs as a result fewer modifications were reported as tdrs at june than otherwise would have been the table below reflects both the new modifications reported as tdrs and the amount of new modifications excluded from tdr classification as a result of regulatory relief dollars in millions for the six months ended june accounts that entered a program and were classified as tdrs during the period accounts excluded from the tdr designation due to regulatory exemptions number of accounts balances number of accounts balances credit card loans private student loans personal loans despite the lower delinquency and tdr trends resulting from the relief we are providing to our customers we believe we have appropriately reflected the risk presented by the accounts using these programs as well as the worsening economic impact of the pandemic on our customers in the allowance for credit losses the increases in the allowance for credit losses during the first half of are indicative of the deterioration in consumer credit we expect related to the pandemic the yeartodate build in the allowance of billion is largely comprised of card loans but includes increases across all loan products labor markets historically indicative of trends in credit losses have been significantly stressed by the pandemic with unemployment reaching unprecedented levels the higher allowance for credit losses reflects our view of this economic impact on our customers refer to note loan receivables to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more details on modification programs troubled debt restructurings and the allowance for credit losses loan receivables consist of the following dollars in millions june december credit card loans other loans private student loans personal loans other total other loans total loan receivables allowance for credit losses net loan receivables prior to adoption of asu no on january credit losses were estimated using the incurred loss approach provision and allowance for credit losses provision for credit losses is the expense related to maintaining the allowance for credit losses at an appropriate level to absorb the estimate of credit losses anticipated over the remaining expected life of loan receivables at each period end date in deriving the estimate of expected credit losses we consider the collectibility of principal interest and fees associated with our loan receivables we also consider expected recoveries of amounts that were either previously charged off or are expected to be charged off establishing the estimate for expected losses requires significant management judgment the factors that influence the provision for credit losses include increases or decreases in outstanding loan balances including changes in consumer spending payment and credit utilization behaviors the level of originations and maturities and changes in the overall mix of accounts and products within the portfolio the credit quality of the loan portfolio which reflects among other factors our credit granting practices and the effectiveness of collection efforts the impact of general economic conditions on the consumer including national and regional conditions unemployment levels bankruptcy trends and interest rate movements the level and direction of historical losses and regulatory changes or new regulatory guidance for more details on how we estimate the allowance for credit losses refer to critical accounting estimates allowance for credit losses on loan receivables and note loan receivables to our condensed

losses on unfunded commitments for the three months and six months ended june respectively as the liability is recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities in our condensed consolidated statements of financial condition prior to adoption of asu no on january credit losses were estimated using the incurred loss approach prior to adoption of asu no on january net chargeoffs on pcd loans generally did not result in a charge to earnings net change in reserves on pcd pools having no remaining nonaccretable difference prior to adoption of asu no on january represents the adjustment to allowance for credit losses as a result of adoption of asu no on january the allowance for credit losses was billion at june which reflects a billion build over the amount of the allowance for credit losses at december the allowance build across all loan products was due to i a billion cumulativeeffect adjustment for the adoption of cecl on january and ii a billion build during the period that primarily reflects an economic outlook with updated assumptions about the impact of the covid pandemic in estimating the allowance at june we used a macroeconomic forecast that assumes a peak unemployment rate of recovering to just under at the end of with slow recovery over the next few years and an annualized real gross domestic product decline of approximately quarteroverquarter or down approximately on a yearoveryear basis the estimate also contemplated the impact of government stimulus programs and companyinitiated loan modification programs on borrower payment behavior the impact of covid19 on the economy has led to uncertainty in assumptions surrounding factors such as the length and depth of economic stresses and borrower behavior which required significant management judgment in estimating the allowance for credit losses companyinitiated loan modification programs include those offered specifically in response to covid19 as well as existing programs offered to customers experiencing difficulty making their payments in addition to skipapay programs we have other modification programs that customers have utilized during the period related to the pandemic the accounts using these modifications are generally excluded from tdr status either because the concessions are insignificant or they qualify for exemption pursuant to the cares act or interagency guidance all modifications are considered as part of the process for determining the allowance for credit losses at adoption of cecl and at june the forecast period management deemed to be reasonable and supportable was months this period decreased to months at march due to the uncertainty caused by the rapidly changing economic environment due to the covid19 pandemic in the second quarter the reasonable and supportable period was months based on the view that the present macroeconomic conditions will last for a longer period than previously expected for both quarters the reversion period was months since adoption of cecl a straightline method was used to revert to appropriate historical information during the quarter ended june the high degree of economic stress led us to apply a weighted reversion method for credit card loans that puts more emphasis on the loss forecast model rather than lower historical losses at june the reversion method remained straightline for all other products the provision for credit losses is the amount of expense realized after considering the level of net chargeoffs in the period and the required amount of allowance for credit losses at the balance sheet date for the three and six months ended june the provision for credit losses increased by billion or and billion or respectively as compared to the same periods in the allowance build was determined under separate methodologies for each period based on the timing of the adoption of asu no on january however the largest driver of the increase in provision between the two periods was the significant change in economic outlook due to the covid19 pandemic net chargeoffs our net chargeoffs include the principal amount of losses charged off less principal recoveries and exclude chargedoff and recovered interest and fees and fraud losses chargedoff and recovered interest and fees are recorded in interest income and loan fee income respectively which is effectively a reclassification of the provision for credit losses while fraud losses are recorded in other expense the following table presents amounts and rates of net chargeoffs of key loan products dollars in millions for the three months ended june for the six months ended june credit card loans private student loans personal loans prior to adoption of asu no on january net chargeoffs on pcd loans generally did not result in a charge to earnings the net chargeoff rate on our credit card loans increased for the three and six months ended june when compared to the same periods in due to seasoning of recent years loan growth the net chargeoff rate on our private student loans remained relatively flat for the three and six months ended june when compared to the same periods in the net chargeoff rate on our personal loans decreased for the three and six months ended june when compared to the same periods in due to improved underwriting delinquencies delinquencies are an indicator of credit quality at a point in time a loan balance is considered delinquent when contractual payments on the loan become days past due the following table presents the amounts and delinquency rates of key loan products that are and days or more delinquent loans that are not accruing interest regardless of delinquency and loans restructured in tdr programs dollars in millions june december loans or more days delinquent credit card loans private student loans personal loans loans or more days delinquent credit card loans private student loans personal loans loans not accruing interest loans restructured in tdr programs credit card loans currently enrolled no longer enrolled total credit card loans private student loans personal loans includes pcd loans for all periods presented we estimate that interest income recognized on credit card loans restructured in tdr programs was million and million for the three months ended june and respectively and million and million for the six months ended june and respectively we do not separately track interest income on loans in tdr programs this amount was estimated by applying an average interest rate to the average loans in the various tdr programs we estimate that the gross interest income that would have been recorded in accordance with the original terms of credit card loans restructured in tdr programs was million and million for the three months ended june and respectively and million and million for the six months ended june and respectively we do not separately track the amount of additional gross interest income that would have been recorded if the loans in tdr programs had not been restructured and interest had instead been recorded in accordance with the original terms this amount was estimated by applying the difference between the average interest rate earned on nonmodified loans and the average interest rate earned on loans in the tdr programs to the average loans in the tdr programs credit card loans restructured in tdr programs include million and million at june and december respectively which are also included in loans or more days delinquent beginning in credit card accounts of borrowers that have previously participated in a temporary interest rate reduction program and that have both demonstrated financial stability and had their charging privileges reinstated at a marketbased interest rate are no longer included in the balance of tdrs private student loans restructured in tdr programs include million and million at june and december respectively which are also included in loans or more days delinquent personal loans restructured in tdr programs include million at both june and december which are also included in loans or more days delinquent the day as well as 90day delinquency rates for credit card loans at june decreased c ompared to december primarily due to the impact of skipapay relief programs the 30day and 90day delinquency rates for private student loans at june decreased c ompared to december primarily due to seasonality of the loan portfolio the 30day and 90day delinquency rates for personal loans at june decreased c ompared to december as a result of improved underwriting the balance of credit card loans reported as tdrs decreased at june as compared to december primarily due to customer usage in programs subject to tdr exclusion in accordance with the cares act or interagency guidance the balance of personal loans reported as tdrs was relatively flat at june as compared to december the balance of private student reported as tdrs increased at june as compared to december due to continued loan growth and improved awareness of programs available to assist borrowers having difficulties making payment obligations we plan to continue to use tdr programs as we believe they are useful in assisting customers experiencing financial difficulties and allowing them to make timely payments see note loan receivables to our condensed consolidated

rewards including cashback bonus rewards of million and million for the three months ended june and respectively and million and million for the six months ended june and respectively total other income decreased for the three and six months ended june as compared to the same periods in primarily due to a decrease in net discount and interchange revenue and loan fee income which were partially offset by an increase in gain on equity investments the decrease in discount and interchange revenue was partially offset by a decrease in rewards costs both of which were the result of lower sales volume due to the impacts of the covid19 pandemic loan fee income decreased due to lower sales volume and late fees sales volume was lower driven by the covid19 impacts late fees decreased as a result of lower delinquencies as we continue to work with our customers through the economic stresses from covid19 gain on equity investments increased primarily from a sale during each quarter other expense the following table represents the components of other expense dollars in millions for the three months ended june vs increase decrease for the six months ended june vs increase decrease employee compensation and benefits marketing and business development information processing and communications professional fees premises and equipment other expense total other expense total other expense was relatively flat for the three months ended june as compared to the same period in marketing costs decreased primarily driven by covid19 related expense reductions in brand advertising for card this was offset by a noncash impairment charge included in other expense on the diners club business within the payment services segment driven by changes in the international travel and entertainment businesses that continue to persist and a declining revenue outlook for the foreseeable future resulting from covid19 and higher employee compensation and benefits driven by a larger headcount base and higher average salaries total other expense increased for the six months ended june as compared to the same period in the increase was primarily driven by the covid19 related noncash impairment charge on the diners club business discussed above employee compensation and benefits and information processing and communications employee compensation and benefits increased as a result of a larger headcount base and higher average salaries the increase in information processing and communications was due to investments in infrastructure this was offset by a decrease in marketing costs due to covid19 related expense reductions in brand advertising for card income tax expense the following table presents the calculation of the effective income tax rate dollars in millions except effective income tax rate for the three months ended june for the six months ended june loss income before income taxes income tax benefit expense effective income tax rate income tax expense decreased million and million for the three and six months ended june respectively as compared to the same periods in due to pretax losses for the current periods the effective tax rate for the three and six months ended june is lower due to a lower projected pretax income for the full year we calculate our provision for income taxes during interim reporting periods by applying an estimate of the annual effective tax rate for the full year to pretax income or loss excluding unusual or infrequent occurring discrete items we are projecting a lower pretax income for the full year therefore the effective tax rate for the full year is lower from the historical annual effective tax rate liquidity and capital resources impact of covid19 on liquidity and capital we entered the covid19 pandemic with strong capital and liquidity positions sized to allow us to maintain normal operations during extended periods of financial market stress and disruptions to wholesale and retail funding sources our reserves of highquality liquid assets and access to diverse funding channels allowed us to refrain from issuing debt in disrupted wholesale funding markets and avoid higher funding costs a s market conditions improved we fortified our capital position in june by raising million of tier capital in the form of perpetual preferred stock moreover our directtoconsumer and sweep deposit balances increased substantially during the second quarter as investors sought safe haven assets consequently our store of liquid assets increased as the quarter progressed we plan to maintain a prudent liquid asset buffer particularly so long as heightened uncertainty around the macroeconomic and financial operating environment persists we remain wellcapitalized with capital ratios in excess of regulatory minimums and took prudent actions to preserve capital when the macroeconomic and operating environment turned uncertain of note we suspended our plans to purchase shares of our common stock and took actions to reduce our exposures to higherrisk segments of our credit portfolio we have completed numerous stress tests to assess the impact of a severe economic downturn on our capital and liquidity and maintain ample amounts of both to ensure we remain wellcapitalized and funded while continuing to serve our customers and extend special accommodations to those who need it funding and liquidity we seek to maintain stable diversified and costeffective funding sources and a strong liquidity profile in order to fund our business and repay or refinance our maturing obligations under both normal operating conditions and periods of economic or financial stress in managing our liquidity risk we seek to maintain a prudent liability maturity profile and ready access to an ample store of primary and contingent liquidity sources our primary funding sources include directtoconsumer and brokered deposits public term assetbacked securitizations and other shortterm and longterm borrowings our primary liquidity sources include a liquidity portfolio comprised of highly liquid unencumbered assets including cash and cash equivalents short term investments and investment securities and borrowing capacity through private term assetbacked securitizations in addition we have unused borrowing capacity with the federal reserve discount window which provides another source of contingent liquidity funding sources deposits we offer deposit products to customers through two channels i through direct marketing internet origination and affinity relationships directtoconsumer deposits and ii indirectly through contractual arrangements with securities brokerage firms brokered deposits directtoconsumer deposits include online savings accounts certificates of deposit money market accounts ira certificates of deposit and checking accounts while brokered deposits include certificates of deposit and sweep accounts at june we had billion of directtoconsumer deposits and billion of brokered and other deposits credit card securitization financing we securitize credit card receivables as a source of funding we access the assetbacked securitization market using the discover card master trust i dcmt and the discover card execution note trust dcent through which we issue dcent discoverseries notes in both public and private transactions from time to time we may add credit card receivables to these trusts to create sufficient funding capacity for future securitizations while managing sellers interest we retain significant exposure to the performance of trust assets through holdings of the sellers interest and subordinated security classes of dcent at june we had billion of outstanding public assetbacked securities and billion of outstanding subordinated assetbacked securities that had been issued to our whollyowned subsidiaries the securitization structures include certain features designed to protect investors the primary feature relates to the availability and adequacy of cash flows in the securitized pool of receivables to meet contractual requirements the insufficiency of which triggers early repayment of the securities we refer to this as economic early amortization which is based on excess spread levels excess spread is the amount by which income received by a trust during a collection period including interest collections fees and interchange exceeds the fees and expenses of the trust during such collection period including interest expense servicing fees and chargedoff receivables in the event of an economic early amortization which would occur if the excess spread fell below on a threemonth rolling average basis we would be required to repay the affected outstanding securitized borrowings using available collections received by the trust for the three months ended june the discoverseries threemonth rolling average excess spread was the period of ultimate repayment would be determined by the amount and timing of collections received through our whollyowned indirect subsidiary discover funding llc we are required to maintain a contractual minimum level of receivables in the trust in excess of the face value of outstanding investors interests this excess is referred to as the minimum sellers interest the required minimum sellers interest in the pool of trust receivables which is included in credit card loan receivables restricted for securitization investors is set at approximately in excess of the total investors interests which includes interests held by third parties as well as those interests held by us if the level of receivables in the trust were to fall below the required minimum we would be required to add receivables from the unrestricted pool of receivables which would increase the amount of credit card loan receivables restricted for securitization investors a decline in the amount of the excess sellers interest could occur if balance repayments and chargeoffs exceeded new lending on the securitized accounts or as a result of changes in total outstanding investors interests sellers interest is impacted by seasonality as higher balance repayments tend to occur in the first calendar year quarter if we could not add enough receivables to satisfy the minimum sellers interest requirement an early amortization or repayment of investors interests would be triggered an early amortization event would impair our liquidity and may require us to utilize our available nonsecuritization related contingent liquidity or rely on alternative funding sources which may or may not be available at the time we have several strategies we can depl oy to prevent an early amortization event for instance we could add additional receivables to the trust which would reduce our available borrowing capacity at the federal reserve discount window as of june there were billion of credit card receivables in the trust and n o accounts were added to those restricted for securitization investors for the three and six months ended june alternatively we could employ structured discounting which was used effectively in to bolster excess spread and mitigate early amortization risk the following table summarizes expected contractual maturities of the investors interests in credit card securitizations excluding those that have been issued to our whollyowned subsidiaries dollars in millions at june total less than one year one year through three years four years through five years after five years scheduled maturities of longterm borrowings owed to credit card securitization investors the triplea rating of dcent class a notes issued to date has been based in part on an fdic rule which created a safe harbor that provides that the fdic as conservator or receiver will not using its power to disaffirm or repudiate contracts seek to reclaim or recover assets transferred in connection with a securitization or recharacterize them as assets of the insured depository institution provided such transfer satisfies the conditions for sale accounting treatment under previous gaap although the implementation of the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification topic transfers and servicing no longer qualified certain transfers of assets for sale accounting treatment the fdic approved a final rule that preserved the safeharbor treatment applicable to revolving trusts and master trusts including dcmt so long as those trusts would have satisfied the original fdic safe harbor if evaluated under gaap pertaining to transfers of financial assets in effect prior to december other legislative and regulatory developments may however impact our ability andor desire to issue assetbacked securities in the future other longterm borrowingsstudent loans at june million of remaining principal balance was outstanding on securitized debt assumed as part of our acquisition of the student loan corporation principal and interest payments on the underlying student loans will reduce the balance of these secured borrowings over time other longterm borrowings corporate and bank debt the following table provides a summary of discover financial services parent company and discover bank outstanding fixedrate debt dollars in millions at june principal amount outstanding discover financial services parent company fixedrate senior notes maturing discover financial services parent company fixedrate retail notes maturing discover bank fixedrate senior bank notes maturing discover bank fixedrate subordinated bank notes maturing certain discover financial services senior notes require us to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to of their aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest in the event of a change of control involving us and a corresponding ratings downgrade to below investment grade shortterm borrowings as part of our regular funding strategy we may from time to time borrow shortterm funds in the federal funds market or the repurchase repo market through repurchase agreements federal funds are shortterm unsecured loans between banks or other financial entities with a federal reserve account funds borrowed in the repo market are shortterm collateralized loans usually secured with highlyrated investment securities such as us treasury bills or notes or federal agency mortgage bonds or debentures at june there were no outstanding balances in the federal funds market or repurchase agreements additional funding sources private assetbacked securitizations we have access to committed borrowing capacity through privately placed assetbacked securitizations at june we had total committed capacity of billion none of which was drawn while we may utilize funding from these private securitizations from time to time for normal business operations their committed nature also makes them a reliable contingency funding source therefore we reserve some undrawn capacity informed by our liquidity stress test results for potential contingency funding needs we also seek to ensure the stability and reliability of these securitizations by staggering their maturity dates renewing them approximately one year prior to their scheduled maturity dates and periodically drawing them for operational testing purposes and seasonal funding needs federal reserve discover bank has access to the federal reserve bank of philadelphias discount window as of june discover bank had billion of available borrowing capacity through the discount window based on the amount and type of assets pledged primarily consumer loans we have no borrowings outstanding under the discount window and reserve this capacity as a source of contingent liquidity funding uses our primary uses of funds include the extensions of loans and credit primarily through discover bank the purchase of investments for our liquidity portfolio working capital and debt and capital service we assess funding uses and liquidity needs under stressed and normal operating conditions considering primary uses of funding such as onbalance sheet loans and contingent uses of funding such as the need to post additional collateral for derivatives positions in order to anticipate funding needs under stress we conduct liquidity stress tests to assess the impact of idiosyncratic systemic and hybrid idiosyncratic and systemic scenarios with varying levels of liquidity risk reflecting a range of stress severity credit ratings our borrowing costs and capacity in certain funding markets including those for securitizations and unsecured senior and subordinated debt may be affected by the credit ratings of dfs discover bank and the securitization trusts downgrades in these credit ratings could result in higher interest expense on our unsecured debt and asset securitizations as well as higher collateral enhancement requirements for both our public and private asset securitizations in addition to increased funding costs deterioration in credit ratings could reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets in light of the covid19 pandemic rating

asset growth and satisfy debt obligations under stressed and normal operating conditions in addition to the funding sources discussed in the previous section we also maintain highly liquid unencumbered assets in our liquidity portfolio that we expect to be able to convert to cash quickly and with little loss of value using either the repo market or outright sales we maintain a liquidity risk and funding management policy which outlines the overall framework and general principles we follow in managing liquidity risk across our business the policy is approved by the board of directors with implementation responsibilities delegated to the asset and liability management committee the alco additionally we maintain a liquidity management framework document which outlines the general strategies objectives and principles we utilize to manage our liquidity position and the various liquidity risks inherent in our business model we seek to balance the tradeoffs between maintaining too much liquidity which may be costly with having too little liquidity which could cause financial distress liquidity risk is centrally managed by the alco which is chaired by our treasurer and has crossfunctional membership the alco monitors the liquidity risk profiles of dfs and discover bank and oversees any actions corporate treasury may take to ensure that we maintain ready access to our funding sources and sufficient liquidity to meet current and projected needs in addition the alco and our board of directors regularly review our compliance with our liquidity limits at dfs and discover bank which are established in accordance with the liquidity risk appetite set by our board of directors we employ a variety of metrics to monitor and manage liquidity we utilize early warning indicators ewis to detect emerging liquidity stress events and a reporting and escalation process that is designed to be consistent with regulatory guidance the ewis include both idiosyncratic and systemic measures and are monitored on a daily basis and reported to the alco regularly a warning from one or more of these indicators triggers prompt review and decisionmaking by our senior management team and in certain instances may lead to the convening of a seniorlevel response team and activation of our contingency funding plan in addition we conduct liquidity stress tests regularly and ensure contingency funding is in place to address potential liquidity shortfalls we evaluate a range of stress scenarios that are designed in accordance with regulatory requirements including idiosyncratic systemic and a combination of such events that could impact funding sources and our ability to meet liquidity needs these scenarios measure the projected liquidity position at dfs and discover bank across a range of time horizons by comparing estimated contingency funding needs to available contingent liquidity our primary contingent liquidity sources include our liquidity portfolio and private securitizations with unused borrowing capacity in addition we have unused borrowing capacity with the federal reserve discount window which provides an additional source of contingent liquidity we seek to maintain sufficient liquidity to be able to satisfy all maturing obligations and fund business operations for at least months in a severe stress environment in such an environment we may also take actions to curtail the size of our balance sheet which would reduce the need for funding and liquidity at june our liquidity portfolio is comprised of highly liquid unencumbered assets including cash and cash equivalents short term investments and investment securities cash and cash equivalents were primarily in the form of deposits with the federal reserve treasury bills and government money market funds short term investments primarily included treasury bills with contractual maturities greater than days but less than one year at the time of acquisition investment securities primarily included debt obligations of the us treasury and residential mortgagebacked securities issued by us government housing agencies or governmentsponsored enterprises these investments are considered highly liquid and we expect to have the ability to raise cash by selling them utilizing repurchase agreements or pledging certain of these investments to access secured funding the size and composition of our liquidity portfolio may fluctuate based upon the size of our balance sheet as well as operational requirements market conditions and interest rate risk management strategies for instance our liquidity portfolio grew materially during the second quarter as customer deposits increased and loan balances declined reflecting consumers response to the covid19 pandemic at june our liquidity portfolio and undrawn credit facilities were billion which was billion higher than the balance at december during the three and six months ended june the average balance of our liquidity portfolio was billion and billion respectively june december  in millions liquidity portfolio cash and cash equivalents other shortterm investments investment

collateral in lieu of cash as of june and december respectively see additional funding sources for additional information capital our primary sources of capital are the earnings generated by our businesses and the proceeds from issuances of capital securities we seek to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support the growth and risks of our businesses and to meet regulatory requirements rating agency targets and debt investor expectations within these constraints we are focused on deploying capital in a manner that provides attractive returns to our stockholders the level composition and utilization of capital are influenced by changes in the economic environment strategic initiatives and legislative and regulatory developments under regulatory capital requirements adopted by the federal reserve and the fdic dfs along with discover bank must maintain minimum levels of capital failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in the initiation of certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could limit our business activities and have a direct material effect on our financial position and results we must meet specific capital requirements that involve quantitative measures of assets liabilities and certain offbalance sheet items as calculated under regulatory guidance and regulations current or future legislative or regulatory reforms such as the implementation of cecl may require us to hold more capital or adversely impact our capital level we consider the potential impacts of these reforms in managing our capital position dfs and discover bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements that became effective january under final rules issued by the federal reserve and the fdic to implement the provisions under the basel committees december framework basel iii rules the basel iii rules require dfs and discover bank to maintain minimum riskbased capital and leverage ratios and define what constitutes capital for purposes of calculating those ratios under basel iii rules for regulatory capital dfs and discover bank are classified as standardized approach entities defined as us banking organizations with consolidated total assets over billion but not exceeding billion and consolidated total onbalance sheet foreign exposures less than billion as of january thresholds within the basel iii rules were fully phased in with the exception of certain transition provisions that were frozen pursuant to regulation issued in november pursuant to a final rule issued in july the transition provisions that were previously frozen have been replaced with new permanent thresholds as discussed below additionally on march federal bank regulatory agencies announced an interim final rule that allows banks that have implemented cecl the option to delay for two years the estimated impact of cecl on regulatory capital followed by a threeyear transition period for purposes of calculating regulatory capital we have elected to defer recognition of the estimated impact of cecl on regulatory capital for two years in accordance with the interim final rule after that period of deferral the estimated impact of cecl on regulatory capital will be phased in over a threeyear period beginning in we estimate that electing this option raises our common equity tier cet1 capital ratios in for additional information regarding the riskbased capital and leverage ratios see note capital adequacy to our condensed consolidated financial statements on march the federal reserve announced the scb final rule which would impose limitations on our capital distributions if we do not maintain our capital ratios above stated regulatory minimum ratios based on the results of supervisory stress tests we participated in the ccar supervisory stress test this year and received our preliminary scb of which primarily reflects the difference between our actual cet1 ratio as of the fourth quarter of and our projected minimum cet1 ratio based on the federal reserves models in its ninequarter severely adverse stress scenario the scb is expected to become effective october and we will receive a final scb by august under this rule we will be required to assess if our planned capital actions are consistent with the effective capital distributions limitations that will apply on a proforma basis throughout the planning horizon see regulatory environment and developments banking capital standards and stress testing for additional information the basel iii rules provide for certain thresholdbased deductions from and adjustments to cet1 to the extent that any one such category or all such categories in the aggregate exceed certain percentages of cet1 in july federal banking regulators issued a final rule that among other things revised certain capital requirements for standardized approach banks by raising the of cet1 deduction threshold for certain items to and eliminating the combined deduction threshold applying to these items these changes became effective for all standardized approach banking institutions in april basel iii rules

from the supervisory stress test notwithstanding the preapproval we were still required to prepare in a capital plan to be approved by our board of directors and on april we submitted to the federal reserve a new capital plan for the period july to june pursuant to the ccar supervisory stress test on june we received the stress test results which are discussed herein we recently declared a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock of per share payable on september to holders of record on august which is consistent with last quarter in light of the current economic downturn the federal
