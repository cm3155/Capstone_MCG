item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations table end the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on s policy changes and forecasting uncertainties given the same information others may reach different reasonable estimates if management used different assumptions in estimating incurred net loan losses the impact to the allowance for loan losses could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for example a change in managements estimate of incurred net loan losses could have resulted in a change of approximately million in the allowance for loan losses at december with a corresponding change in the provision for loan losses see loan quality and note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements for further details about our allowance for loan losses goodwill we recognize goodwill when the purchase price of an acquired business exceeds the total of the fair values of the acquired net assets as required by gaap we test goodwill for impairment annually or more often if indicators of impairment exist in evaluating goodwill for impairment management must estimate the fair value of the reporting units to which the goodwill relates because market data concerning acquisitions of comparable businesses typically are not readily obtainable other valuation techniques such as earnings multiples and cash flow models are used in estimating the fair values of these reporting units in applying these techniques management considers historical results business forecasts market and industry conditions and other factors we may also consult independent valuation experts where needed in applying these valuation techniques the valuation methodologies we use involve assumptions about business performance revenue and expense growth capital expenditures discount rates and other assumptions that are judgmental in nature at december we reported goodwill of million associated with our pulse network the estimated fair value of the pulse reporting unit was more than six times its carrying value as of october and there are no present conditions that we believe would cause the fair value of this reporting unit to fall below its carrying value however competitive pressures leading to significant declines in revenue significant increases in the cost of equity deteriorating economic conditions or other events adversely impacting the assumptions used by management in the valuation could cause the fair value of the reporting unit or the associated goodwill to decline in the future which could result in an impairment loss at december based on the annual impairment testing performed there was no impairment identified see note goodwill and intangible assets to our consolidated financial statements for further details about goodwill and the related impairment testing income taxes we are subject to the income tax laws of the jurisdictions where we have business operations primarily the united states its states and municipalities we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining the provision for income taxes and must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit we regularly evaluate the likelihood of assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from current and subsequent years examinations and tax reserves are established as appropriate changes in the estimate of income taxes can occur due to tax rate changes interpretations of tax laws the status and resolution of examinations by the taxing authorities and newly enacted laws and regulations that impact the relative merits of tax positions taken when such changes occur such as the recent rate change enacted with the tax cuts and jobs act of the effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations can be significant see note income taxes to our

have similar risk characteristics we use a migration analysis to estimate the likelihood that a loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency we use other analyses to estimate losses incurred from nondelinquent accounts which adds to the identification of loss emergence we use these analyses together as a basis for determining our allowance for loan losses the provision for loan losses is the amount of expense realized after considering the level of net chargeoffs in the period and the required amount of allowance for loan losses at the balance sheet date for the year ended december the provision for loan losses increased by million or as compared to the year ended december primarily due to higher levels of net chargeoffs slightly offset by lower reserve builds the allowance for loan losses was billion at december which reflects a million reserve build over the amount of the allowance for loan losses at december the reserve build which primarily related to

strong liquidity profile in order to fund our business and repay or refinance our maturing obligations under both normal operating conditions and periods of economic or financial stress in managing our liquidity risk we seek to maintain a prudent liability maturity profile and ready access to an ample store of primary and contingent liquidity sources our primary funding sources include directtoconsumer and brokered deposits public term assetbacked securitizations and other shortterm and longterm borrowings our primary liquidity sources include a liquidity portfolio comprised of highly liquid unencumbered assets including cash and cash equivalents and investment securities and borrowing capacity through private term assetbacked securitizations in addition we have unused borrowing capacity with the federal reserve discount window which provides another source of contingent liquidity funding sources deposits we offer deposit products to customers through two channels i through direct marketing internet origination and affinity relationships directtoconsumer deposits and ii indirectly through contractual arrangements with securities brokerage firms brokered deposits directtoconsumer deposits include online savings accounts certificates of deposit money market accounts ira certificates of deposit and checking accounts while brokered deposits include certificates of deposit and sweep accounts at december we had billion of directtoconsumer deposits and billion of brokered and other deposits credit card securitization financing we securitize credit card receivables as a source of funding we access the assetbacked securitization market using the discover card master trust i dcmt and the discover card execution note trust dcent through which we issue dcent discoverseries notes in both public and private transactions from time to time we may add credit card receivables to these trusts to create sufficient funding capacity for future securitizations while managing sellers interest we retain significant exposure to the performance of trust assets through holdings of the sellers interest and subordinated security classes of dcent the securitization structures include certain features designed to protect investors the primary feature relates to the availability and adequacy of cash flows in the securitized pool of receivables to meet contractual requirements the insufficiency of which triggers early repayment of the securities we refer to this as economic early amortization which is based on excess spread levels excess spread is the amount by which income received by a trust during a collection period including interest collections fees and interchange exceeds the fees and expenses of the trust during such collection period including interest expense servicing fees and chargedoff receivables in the event of an economic early amortization which would occur if the excess spread fell below on a threemonth rolling average basis we would be required to repay the affected outstanding securitized borrowings using available collections received by the trust the period of ultimate repayment would be determined by the amount and timing of collections received an early amortization event would impair our liquidity and may require us to utilize our available nonsecuritization related contingent liquidity or rely on alternative funding sources which may or may not be available at the time as of december the discoverseries threemonth rolling average excess spread was we may elect to add receivables to the restricted pool of receivables subject to certain requirements through our whollyowned indirect subsidiary discover funding llc we are required to maintain a contractual minimum level of receivables in the trust in excess of the face value of outstanding investors interests this excess is referred to as the minimum sellers interest the required minimum sellers interest in the pool of trust receivables which is included in credit card loan receivables restricted for securitization investors is set at approximately in excess of the total investors interests which includes interests held by third parties as well as those interests held by us if the level of receivables in the trust were to fall below the required minimum we would be required to add receivables from the unrestricted pool of receivables which would increase the amount of credit card loan receivables restricted for securitization investors a decline in the amount of the excess sellers interest could occur if balance repayments and chargeoffs exceeded new lending on the securitized accounts or as a result of changes in total outstanding investors interests sellers interest is impacted by seasonality as higher balance repayments tend to occur in the first calendar year quarter if we could not add enough receivables to satisfy the minimum sellers interest requirement an early amortization or repayment of investors interests would be triggered no accounts were added to those restricted for securitization investors for the year ended december at december we had billion of outstanding public assetbacked securities and billion of outstanding subordinated assetbacked securities that had been issued to our whollyowned subsidiaries table start the following table summarizes expected contractual maturities of the investors interests in credit card securitizations excluding those that have been issued to our whollyowned subsidiaries dollars in millions at december total less than one year one year through three years four years through five years after five years scheduled maturities of longterm borrowings owed to credit card securitization investors table end the triplea rating of dcent class a notes issued to date has been based in part on an fdic rule which created a safe harbor that provides that the fdic as conservator or receiver will not using its power to disaffirm or repudiate contracts seek to reclaim or recover assets transferred in connection with a securitization or recharacterize them as assets of the insured depository institution provided such transfer satisfies the conditions for sale accounting treatment under previous gaap although the implementation of the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification topic transfers and servicing no longer qualified certain transfers of assets for sale accounting treatment the fdic approved a final rule that preserved the safeharbor treatment applicable to revolving trusts and master trusts including dcmt so long as those trusts would have satisfied the original fdic safe harbor if evaluated under gaap pertaining to transfers of financial assets in effect prior to december other legislative and regulatory developments may however impact our ability andor desire to issue assetbacked securities in the future other longterm borrowingsstudent loans at december million of remaining principal

senior notes require us to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to of their aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest in the event of a change of control involving us and a corresponding ratings downgrade to below investment grade shortterm borrowings as part of our regular funding strategy we may from time to time borrow shortterm funds in the federal funds market or the repurchase repo market through repurchase agreements federal funds are shortterm unsecured loans between banks or other financial entities with a federal reserve account funds borrowed in the repo market are shortterm collateralized loans usually secured with highlyrated investment securities such as us treasury bills or notes or federal agency mortgage bonds or debentures at december there were no outstanding balances in the federal funds market or repurchase agreements additional funding sources private assetbacked securitizations we have access to committed borrowing capacity through privately placed assetbacked securitizations at december we had total committed capacity of billion million of which was drawn while we may utilize funding from these private securitizations from time to time for normal business operations their committed nature also makes them a reliable contingency funding source therefore we reserve some undrawn capacity informed by our liquidity stress test results for potential contingency funding needs we also seek to ensure the stability and reliability of these securitizations by staggering their maturity dates renewing them approximately one year prior to their scheduled maturity dates and periodically drawing them for operational testing purposes and seasonal funding needs federal reserve discover bank has access to the federal reserve bank of philadelphias discount window as of december discover bank had billion of available borrowing capacity through the discount window based on the amount and type of assets pledged primarily consumer

under stressed and normal operating conditions considering primary uses of funding such as onbalance sheet loans and contingent uses of funding such as the need to post additional collateral for derivatives positions in order to anticipate funding needs under stress we conduct liquidity stress tests to assess the impact of idiosyncratic systemic and hybrid idiosyncratic and systemic scenarios with varying levels of liquidity risk reflecting a range of stress severity credit ratings our borrowing costs and capacity in certain funding markets including those for securitizations and unsecured senior and subordinated debt may be affected by the credit ratings of dfs discover bank and the securitization trusts downgrades in these credit ratings could result in higher interest expense on our unsecured debt and asset securitizations as well as higher collateral enhancement requirements for both our public and private asset securitizations in addition to increased funding costs deterioration in credit ratings could reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets we also maintain agreements with certain of our derivative counterparties that contain provisions that require dfs and discover bank to maintain an investment grade credit rating from specified major credit rating agencies at december discover banks credit rating met specified thresholds set by its counterparties however if its credit ratings were to fall below investment grade discover bank would be required to post additional collateral which as of

we seek to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to sustain business operations fund asset growth and satisfy debt obligations under stressed and normal operating conditions in addition to the funding sources discussed in the previous section we also maintain highly liquid unencumbered assets in our liquidity portfolio that we expect to be able to convert to cash quickly and with little loss of value using either the repo market or outright sales we maintain a liquidity risk and funding management policy which outlines the overall framework and general principles we follow in managing liquidity risk across our business the policy is approved by the board of directors with implementation responsibilities delegated to the asset and liability management committee the alco additionally we maintain a liquidity management framework document which outlines the general strategies objectives and principles we utilize to manage our liquidity position and the various liquidity risks inherent in our business model we seek to balance the tradeoffs between maintaining too much liquidity which may be costly with having too little liquidity which could cause financial distress liquidity risk is centrally managed by the alco which is chaired by our treasurer and has crossfunctional membership the alco monitors the liquidity risk profiles of dfs and discover bank and oversees any actions corporate treasury may take to ensure that we maintain ready access to our funding sources and sufficient liquidity to meet current and projected needs in addition the alco and our board of directors regularly review our compliance with our liquidity limits at dfs and discover bank which are established in accordance with the liquidity risk appetite set by our board of directors we employ a variety of metrics to monitor and manage liquidity we utilize early warning indicators ewis to detect the initial phases of liquidity stress events and a reporting and escalation process that is designed to be consistent with regulatory guidance the ewis include both idiosyncratic and systemic measures and are monitored on a daily basis and reported to the alco regularly a warning from one or more of these indicators triggers prompt review and decisionmaking by our senior management team and in certain instances may lead to the convening of a seniorlevel response team and activation of our contingency funding plan in addition we conduct liquidity stress tests regularly and ensure contingency funding is in place to address potential liquidity shortfalls we evaluate a range of stress scenarios that are designed in accordance with regulatory requirements including idiosyncratic systemic and a combination of such events that could impact funding sources and our ability to meet liquidity needs these scenarios measure the projected liquidity position at dfs and discover bank across a range of time horizons by comparing estimated contingency funding needs to available contingent liquidity our primary contingent liquidity sources include our liquidity portfolio and private securitizations with unused borrowing capacity in addition we have unused borrowing capacity with the federal reserve discount window which provides an additional source of contingent liquidity we seek to maintain sufficient liquidity to be able to satisfy all maturing obligations and fund business operations for at least months in a severe stress environment in such an environment we may also take actions to curtail the size of our balance sheet which would reduce the need for funding and liquidity at december our liquidity portfolio is comprised of highly liquid unencumbered assets including cash and cash equivalents and investment securities cash and cash equivalents were primarily in the form of deposits with the federal reserve investment securities primarily included debt obligations of the us treasury and residential mortgagebacked securities issued by us government housing agencies or governmentsponsored enterprises these investments are considered highly liquid and we expect to have the ability to raise cash by selling them utilizing repurchase agreements or pledging certain of these investments to access secured funding the size and composition of our liquidity portfolio may fluctuate based upon the size of our balance sheet as well as operational requirements market conditions and interest rate risk management policies for example we have altered the composition of our liquidity portfolio to mitigate the potential volatility of

investor expectations within these constraints we are focused on deploying capital in a manner that provides attractive returns to our stockholders the level composition and utilization of capital are influenced by changes in the economic environment strategic initiatives and legislative and regulatory developments under regulatory capital requirements adopted by the federal reserve and the fdic dfs along with discover bank must maintain minimum levels of capital failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in the initiation of certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could limit our business activities and have a direct material effect on our financial position and results we must meet specific capital requirements that involve quantitative measures of assets liabilities and certain offbalance sheet items as calculated under regulatory guidance and regulations current or future legislative or regulatory reforms such as the future implementation of cecl may require us to hold more capital or adversely impact our capital level we consider the potential impacts of these reforms in managing our capital position discover financial services and discover bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements that became effective january under final rules issued by the federal reserve and the federal deposit insurance corporation to implement the provisions under the basel committees december framework basel iii rules the basel iii rules require discover financial services and discover

pursuant to regulation issued in november pursuant to a final rule issued in july the transition provisions that were previously frozen will be replaced with new permanent thresholds as discussed below for additional information regarding the riskbased capital and leverage ratios see note capital adequacy to our consolidated financial statements the basel iii rules also introduced a capital conservation buffer ccb on top of the minimum riskweighted asset ratios the buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress the application of the buffer was subject to phasein periods that ended december then beginning january the ccb effectively results in minimum regulatory capital ratios including the ccb of i common equity tier cet1 to riskweighted assets of at least ii tier capital to riskweighted assets of at least and iii total capital to riskweighted assets of at least banking institutions with a capital ratio below the required threshold will face constraints on
