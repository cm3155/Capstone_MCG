of the merger could be less than anticipated and integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses an inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the merger and the

results of the combined company following the completion of the merger which may adversely affect the value of the common stock of the combined company following the completion of the merger we and capital one have operated and until the completion of the merger must continue to operate independently it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees the disruption of each companys ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect the companies ability to maintain relationships with merchants merchant acquirers clients customers depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger integration efforts between the companies may also divert management

additional recruitment costs in addition following the merger if key employees terminate their employment the combined companys business activities may be adversely affected and managements attention may be diverted from successfully hiring suitable replacements all of which may cause the combined companys business to suffer we and capital one also may not be able to locate or retain suitable replacements for any key employees who leave either company current economic and regulatory environment economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition as a provider of consumer financial services our business results of operations and financial condition are subject to the us and global economic environment a customers ability and willingness to repay us can be impacted by not only economic conditions but also a customers other payment obligations economic conditions also can reduce the usage of credit cards in general and the average purchase amount of transactions industrywide including our cards which reduces interest income and transaction fees we rely heavily on interest income from our credit card business to generate earnings our interest income from credit card loans was billion for the year ended december which was of net revenues defined as net interest income plus other income compared to billion for the year ended december which was of net revenues economic conditions combined with a competitive marketplace could slow loan growth resulting in reduced revenue growth from our core digital banking business financial regulatory developments have had an impact and will continue to significantly impact the environment for the financial services industry which could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition under the enhanced prudential standards that apply to bank holding companies dfs is considered a category iv institution and therefore subject to the least stringent category of these standards for domestic bank holding companies with at least billion in total assets however many of the core components of the regulations implementing enhanced prudential standards continue to apply to dfs since dfs has been subject to slightly more tailored requirements for capital stress testing liquidity risk management and resolution planning in addition proposed changes to the regulatory capital rules issued by the federal banking regulators under the basel committees december framework the basel iii rules if adopted as proposed could require us to maintain additional capital the impact of the evolving regulatory environment on our business and operations depends upon a number of factors including i the legislative priorities of the us congress ii priorities and actions of the federal reserve fdic and cfpb iii implications resulting from our competitors and other marketplace participants and iv changing consumer behavior for additional information regarding bank regulatory matters impacting us see business supervision and regulation regulatory and legislative developments findings and actions have had and could continue to have a negative impact on our business strategies or require us to limit exit or modify our business practices and product offerings restructure our products in unanticipated ways invest more management time and resources in compliance efforts limit the fees we charge for services impact the value of our assets or limit our ability to pursue certain innovations and business opportunities and obtain related required regulatory approvals for additional information regarding bank regulatory limitations on acquisitions and investments see business supervision and regulation acquisitions and investments furthermore see note litigation and regulatory matters to our consolidated financial statements for more information on recent matters affecting us it is possible that any new regulatory measures or legislation may disproportionately affect us due to our size structure or product offerings among other things compliance expectations and expenditures have steadily and significantly increased for us and the same is true for other financial services firms as regulators have escalated their focus on the adequacy of controls to support business operations we may have to invest further in risk management compliance and other functions in response to possible regulatory feedback we may face compliance and regulatory risks if we introduce new or changed products and services or enter into new business arrangements with thirdparty service providers alternative payment providers or other industry participants heightened regulatory expectations and increased volume of regulatory changes may generate additional expenses or require significant time and resources to maintain compliance for more information regarding the regulatory environment and developments potentially impacting us see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regulatory environment and developments strategic business risk we face competition in the credit card market from other consumer financial services providers and we may not be able to compete effectively which could result in fewer customers and lower account balances and could materially adversely affect our financial condition cash flows and results of operations the consumer financial services business is highly competitive we compete with other consumer financial services providers including nontraditional providers of financing and payment services such as financial technology firms based on several factors including brand reputation customer service product offerings incentives pricing digital payments and other terms competition in credit cards is also based on merchant acceptance and the value provided to the customer by rewards programs and other innovations many credit card issuers have instituted rewards programs that are similar to ours and in some cases could be viewed as more attractive to customers than our programs these competitive factors affect our ability to attract and retain customers increase usage of our products and maximize the revenue generated by our products in addition because most domesticallyissued credit cards other than those issued by american express are issued on the visa and mastercard networks most other card issuers benefit from the dominant position and marketing and pricing power of visa and mastercard the competitive marketplace could result in slower loan growth resulting in reduced revenue growth from our core digital banking business if we are unable to compete successfully or if competing successfully requires us to take aggressive actions in response to competitors actions our financial condition cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected we incur considerable costs in competing with other consumer financial services providers and many of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do which may place us at a competitive disadvantage and negatively affect our financial results we incur considerable costs in competing with other consumer financial services providers to attract and retain customers and increase usage of our products a substantial portion of this cost relates to marketing expenditures and rewards programs since our rewards rate which represents rewards cost divided by discover card sales volume has increased from less than to in we expect the competitive intensity in the rewards space to continue which could result in a continued increase in the cost of our rewards programs our consumer financial services products compete primarily based on pricing terms and service because of the highly competitive nature of the credit cardissuing business a primary method of competition among credit card issuers including us has been to offer rewards programs low introductory interest rates attractive standard purchase rates and balance transfer programs that offer a favorable annual percentage rate or other financial incentives for a specified length of time on account balances transferred from another credit card competition is intense in the credit card industry and customers may frequently switch credit cards or transfer their balances to another card we expect to continue to invest in initiatives to remain competitive in the consumer financial services industry including the launch of new cards and features brand awareness initiatives targeted marketing online and mobile enhancements ewallet participation customer service improvements credit risk management and operations enhancements and infrastructure efficiencies however there can be no assurance that any of the costs we incur or incentives we offer to attempt to acquire and maintain accounts and increase usage of our products will be effective in addition to the extent that we offer new products features or services to remain competitive we may be subject to increased operational or other risks furthermore many of our competitors are larger than we are have greater financial resources than we do have more breadth in banking products have lower funding costs than we have and expect to have and have assets such as branch locations and cobrand relationships that may be appealing to certain customers for example larger credit card issuers which have greater resources than we do may be better positioned to fund appealing rewards marketing and advertising programs we may be at a competitive disadvantage as a result of the greater financial resources diversification and scale of many of our competitors our costs directly affect our earnings results many factors can influence the amount of our costs as well as how quickly it may increase our ongoing investments in infrastructure including technology such as generative artificial intelligence ai which may be necessary to maintain a competitive business integrate newlyacquired businesses and establish scalable operations increase our costs in addition as our business develops changes or expands additional costs can arise as a result of a reevaluation of business strategies management of outsourced services asset purchases structural reorganization compliance with new laws or regulations or the acquisition of new businesses if we are unable to manage our costs successfully our financial results will be negatively affected the inability to compete against other operators of payment networks and alternative payment providers could result in reduced transaction volume limited merchant acceptance of our cards limited issuance of cards on our networks by third parties and materially reduced earnings from our payment services business we face substantial and increasingly intense competition in the payments industry both from traditional players and new emerging alternative payment providers for example we compete with other payment networks to attract network partners to issue credit and debit cards and other card products on the discover pulse and diners club networks collectively the discover global network competition with other operators of payment networks is generally based on issuer fees fees paid to networks including switch fees merchant acceptance network size and functionality technological capabilities and other economic terms competition is also based on customer perception of service quality brand image reputation and market share further we are facing ongoing competition from alternative payment providers who may create innovative network or other arrangements with our primary competitors large merchants or other industry participants which could adversely impact our costs transaction volume and ability to grow our business many of our competitors are well established larger than we are andor have greater financial resources or scale than we do these competitors have provided financial incentives to card issuers such as large cash signing bonuses for new programs funding for and sponsorship of marketing programs and other bonuses visa and mastercard each enjoy greater merchant acceptance and broader global brand recognition than we do although we have made progress in merchant acceptance we have not achieved global market parity with visa and mastercard in addition visa and mastercard have entered into longterm arrangements with many financial institutions that may have the effect of discouraging those institutions from issuing cards on the discover network or issuing debit cards on the pulse network some of these arrangements are exclusive or nearly exclusive which further limits our ability to conduct material amounts of business with these institutions if we are unable to remain competitive on issuer fees and other incentives we may be unable to offer adequate pricing to network partners while maintaining sufficient net revenues we also face competition as merchants put pressure on transaction fees increasing merchant fees or acquirer fees could adversely affect our effort to increase merchant acceptance of credit cards issued on the discover global network and may cause merchant acceptance to decrease this in turn could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain network partners who may seek out more costeffective alternatives from both traditional and nontraditional payment services providers which may limit our ability to maintain or grow revenues from our proprietary network in addition competitors settlements with merchants and related actions including pricing pressures andor surcharging could negatively impact our business practices competitor actions related to the structure of merchant and acquirer fees and merchant and acquirer transaction routing strategies have adversely affected and are expected to continue to adversely affect our pulse networks business practices network transaction volume revenue and prospects for future growth and entry into new product markets visa has entered into arrangements with some merchants and acquirers that have and are expected to continue to have the effect of discouraging those merchants and acquirers from routing debit transactions to pulse in addition the doddfrank acts network participation requirements and competitor actions negatively impact pulses ability to enter into exclusivity arrangements which affects pulses business practices and may materially adversely affect its network transaction volume and revenue pulse has a pending lawsuit against visa with respect to these competitive concerns pulses transaction processing revenue was million and million for the years ended december and respectively american express is also a strong competitor with international acceptance high transaction fees and an upscale brand image internationally american express competes in the same market segments as diners club we may face challenges in increasing international acceptance on our networks particularly if third parties that we rely on to issue diners club cards increase card acceptance and market our brands do not perform to our expectations in addition if we are unable to maintain sufficient network functionality to be competitive with other networks or if our competitors develop better data security solutions or more innovative products and services than we do our ability to retain and attract network partners and maintain or increase the revenues generated by our proprietary cardissuing business or our pulse business may be materially adversely affected our competitive position could also be affected if we are unable to deploy in a cost effective and competitive manner technology such as generative ai additionally competitors may develop data security solutions which as a consequence of the competitors market power we may be forced to use in that case our business may be adversely affected as they may be better positioned to absorb the costs over higher volumes or a larger customer base our business depends upon relationships with issuers merchant acquirers other payment enablers and licensees many of whom are financial institutions the economic and regulatory environment and increased consolidation in the financial services industry decrease our opportunities for new business and may result in the termination of existing business relationships if a business partner is acquired or goes out of business in addition as a result of this environment financial institutions may have decreased interest in engaging in new card issuance opportunities or expanding existing card issuance relationships which would inhibit our ability to grow our payment services business we continue to face substantial and intense competition in the payments industry which impacts our revenue margins transaction volume and business strategies if we are unsuccessful in maintaining a strong base of network licensees and achieving meaningful global card acceptance we may be unable to achieve longterm success in our international network business we continue to make progress toward achieving increased global card acceptance for the discover global network since we acquired the diners club network and related assets in achieving global card acceptance would allow our customers including thirdparty issuers leveraging the network to use their cards at merchant and atm locations around the world our international network business depends upon the cooperation support and continuous operation of the network licensees that issue diners club cards and that maintain a merchant acceptance network as is the case for other card payment networks our diners club network does not issue cards or determine the terms and conditions of cards issued by the network licensees if we are unable to continue our relationships with network licensees or if the network licensees are unable to continue their relationships with merchants our ability to maintain or increase revenues and to remain competitive would be adversely affected due to the potential deterioration in customer relationships and related demand that could result if one or more licensees were to experience a significant impairment of their business or were to cease doing business for economic regulatory or other reasons we would face the adverse effects of business interruption in a particular market including loss of volume acceptance and revenue and exposure to potential reputational risk if such conditions arise in the future we may deploy resources and incur expenses in order to sustain network acceptance additionally interruption of network licensee relationships could have an adverse effect on the acceptance of discover cards when they are used on the diners club network outside of north america the longterm success of our international network business depends upon achieving meaningful global card acceptance which has included and may continue to include higher overall costs or longer timeframes than anticipated economic and regulatory challenges facing the student lending business could have a negative effect on our student loan portfolio the success of our student loan strategy depends upon our ability to manage the credit risk pricing funding operations expenses and originations winddown of our student loan business and compliance with the december consent order with the cfpb the order our student loan strategy is also impacted by external factors such as the overall economic environment changes in interest rates and prepayment rates and a challenging regulatory environment for private student loans and student loans generally for more information on the regulatory environment see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regulatory environment and developments and note litigation and regulatory matters to our consolidated financial statements there are several challenges to managing our private student loan business including i economic weakness ii new changes in federal and state laws or regulations and iii other government and regulatory focus on higher education costs student lending student loan repayments and student loan servicing examples of these challenges include the recent legislative focus on federal student loan debt forgiveness in bankruptcy and current and anticipated legislative proposals in a number of states and the district of columbia imposing new requirements on private student loan lenders and servicers these challenges may require us to restructure our private student loan products and servicing activities in ways we may not currently anticipate in addition changes that adversely affect the private student loan market generally may negatively impact the profitability of our student loan portfolio the potential sale of the discover student loan portfolio and transfer of servicing of such loans to a thirdparty provider may result in disruptions to our business and operations and no assurances can be made that such sale andor servicing transfer will be completed or will be as successful as projected or expected in november we announced that our board of directors authorized our management to explore the sale of the discover student loan portfolio and the transfer of servicing of such loans to a thirdparty provider the time and effort associated with pursuing such sale andor transfer may result in disruption to our businesses and operations andor diversion of management attention from other business concerns which could impair our relationships with our current employees customers and strategic partners if we are unable to retain key employees including management who are critical to overseeing operating and managing our student loan portfolio and the potential sale and servicing transfer of such loans we could face disruptions in our operations issues administering and servicing our student loans challenges complying with the order loss of key information expertise or knowhow and unanticipated additional recruitment costs such sale andor transfer involves significant risks execution complexity and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business these risks complexities and uncertainties include among others i the time necessary to evaluate and effect such sale andor transfer ii the level of interest from buyers or thirdparty servicers iii the price and other terms upon which buyers are willing to acquire the loans and thirdparty servicers are willing to service the loans iv our ability to successfully negotiate terms and conditions with buyers and thirdparty servicers and to satisfy such terms and conditions v buyers ability to obtain financing to acquire the loans vi a thirdparty servicers ability to successfully onboard the loans vii potential challenges in separating the assets and operations of the discover student loan business from our other businesses viii requirements and impact of the order ix our ability to retain the talent and focus of our key employees dedicated to our student loan portfolio and x the ability of the applicable parties to obtain any required regulatory approvals and other necessary thirdparty consents such sale andor transfer may require our continued involvement such as through transition service agreements guarantees loan repurchase obligations loan servicing obligations and indemnities or other current or contingent financial obligations and liabilities additionally such sale andor transfer may expose us to increased information security risk as we provide data and information access to third parties there is no guarantee that i the anticipated benefits of such sale andor transfer will be realized or ii we will be able to effectuate such sale andor transfer at the prices times or volumes we desire or at all the inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits issues related to our ability to fully satisfy any postsale andor posttransfer obligations related to the discover student loan portfolio and any delays encountered in such sale andor transfer process could have an adverse effect upon our capital position revenues levels of expenses regulatory standing and operating results which may adversely affect the value of our common stock also our board of directors may determine that it is in our best interest ultimately not to complete such sale andor transfer acquisitions strategic investments or divestitures may not be successful and could disrupt our business harm our financial condition or reduce our earnings we may consider or undertake strategic acquisitions of or material investments in businesses products portfolios of loans or technologies in the future and we may also divest or explore the sale of businesses portfolios of loans or technologies from time to time we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition or investment candidates or even if we do identify suitable candidates they may be difficult to finance or expensive to fund additionally there is no guarantee that we can obtain any necessary regulatory approvals obtain any necessary financing or complete transactions on terms that are favorable to us or in a timely manner we generally must receive federal regulatory approvals before we can acquire a bank bank holding company deposits or certain assets or businesses for additional information regarding bank regulatory limitations on acquisitions and investments see business supervision and regulation acquisitions and investments to the extent we pay the purchase price of any strategic acquisition or investment in cash it may have an adverse effect on our financial condition similarly if the purchase price is paid with our stock it may be dilutive to our stockholders in addition we may assume liabilities associated with a business acquisition or investment including unrecorded liabilities that are not discovered at the time of the transaction the repayment or settlement of those liabilities may have an adverse effect on our financial condition additionally a divestiture may result in continued financial obligations such as through transition service agreements guarantees indemnities or other current or contingent financial obligations and liabilities following the transaction the satisfaction of these continued financial obligations may also have an adverse effect on our financial condition we may not be able to successfully integrate or disaggregate personnel operations businesses products or technologies of an acquisition investment or divestiture integration may be particularly challenging if we enter into a line of business in which we have limited experience andor if the business operates in or involves products or technologies in a difficult legal regulatory or competitive environment we may find that we do not have adequate operations or expertise to manage the new business products or technologies the integration or disaggregation of any acquisition investment or divestiture may divert managements time and resources from our core business which could impair our relationships with our current employees customers and strategic partners and disrupt our operations additionally any acquisition investment or divestiture may expose us to increased information security risk as we integrate new systems that we may not be as familiar with or bring them in line with the requirements of our information security and business continuity programs or provide data and information access to third parties acquisitions investments and divestitures also may not perform to our expectations for various reasons including the loss of key personnel customers or vendors or changes in the economic or regulatory environment if we fail to integrate acquisitions or investments divest businesses or realize the expected benefits we may lose the return on these acquisitions investments or divestitures or incur additional transaction costs as a result our business reputation and financial condition may be harmed credit market and liquidity risk the failure to successfully manage credit risk which may result in high delinquency and chargeoff rates could materially adversely affect our business profitability and financial condition as a lender we are exposed to the risk that our borrowers will be unable or unwilling to repay the principal of or interest on loans in accordance with their terms we seek to grow our loan receivables while maintaining quality credit performance our success depends on our ability to manage credit risk while attracting new customers with profitable usage patterns we select customers manage their accounts and establish terms and credit limits using externally developed and proprietary scoring models and other analytical techniques designed to set terms and credit limits to appropriately compensate us for the credit risk we accept while encouraging customers to use their available credit the models and approaches we use may not accurately predict future chargeoffs due to among other things inaccurate assumptions while we continually seek to improve our assumptions and models we may make modifications that unintentionally cause them to be less predictive or incorrectly interpret the data produced by these models in setting our credit policies at december and billion or and billion or of our loan receivables were nonperforming defined as loans over days delinquent and accruing interest plus loans not accruing interest our ability to manage credit risk and avoid high chargeoff rates may be adversely affected by household business economic and market conditions that may be difficult to predict when these conditions deteriorate we may experience reduced demand for credit and increased delinquencies or defaults including loans which we have securitized and in which we retain a residual interest the level of nonperforming loans chargeoffs and delinquencies could rise and require additional provision for credit losses there can be no assurance that our underwriting and portfolio management strategies will permit us to avoid high chargeoff levels or that our allowance for credit losses will be sufficient to cover actual losses a customers ability and willingness to repay us can be impacted by changes in their employment status increases in their payment obligations to other lenders and by restricted availability of credit to consumers generally our collection operations may not compete effectively to secure more of customers diminished cash flow than our competitors in addition we may fail to quickly identify customers who are likely to default on their payment obligations and reduce our exposure by closing credit lines and restricting authorizations which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations our ability to manage credit risk also may be adversely affected by legal or regulatory changes such as restrictions on collections bankruptcy laws minimum payment regulations and reage guidance competitors actions and consumer behavior as well as inadequate collections staffing resources techniques and models there can be no assurance that we will be able to grow the loan receivables portfolio in accordance with our strategies or manage credit and other risks associated with the loan products our failure to manage credit and other risks may materially adversely affect profitability and the ability to grow the loan receivables portfolio and further diversify the business adverse market conditions or an inability to effectively manage our liquidity risk could negatively impact our ability to meet our liquidity and funding needs which could materially adversely impact our business results of operations and overall financial condition we must effectively manage the liquidity risk to which we are exposed we require liquidity in order to meet cash requirements such as daytoday operating expenses extensions of credit on our consumer loans satisfaction of deposit liabilities upon withdrawal or maturity and required payments of principal and interest on our borrowings our primary sources of liquidity and funding are payments on our loan receivables deposits and proceeds from securitization transactions and securities offerings we may maintain too much liquidity which can be costly or we may be too illiquid which could limit financial flexibility and result in financial distress during a liquidity stress event our liquidity portfolio had a balance of approximately billion as of december compared to billion as of december our total contingent liquidity sources amounted to billion as of december compared to billion as of december as of december our total contingent liquidity sources consisted of billion in our liquidity portfolio billion of undrawn capacity in private securitizations billion in borrowing capacity with the fhlb of chicago and billion in incremental federal reserve discount window capacity in the event that our current sources of liquidity do not satisfy our needs we would be required to seek additional financing the availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit to the financial services industry new regulatory restrictions and requirements and our credit ratings disruptions uncertainty or volatility in the capital credit or deposit markets may limit our ability to repay or replace maturing liabilities in a timely manner as such we may be forced to delay the acquisition of additional funding or be forced to issue or raise funding at undesirable terms andor costs which could decrease profitability and significantly reduce financial flexibility further in disorderly financial markets or for other reasons it may be difficult or impossible to liquidate some of our investments to meet our liquidity needs there can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future likewise adverse developments with respect to financial institutions and other third parties with whom we maintain important financial relationships could negatively impact our funding and liquidity if we are unable to continue to fund our assets through deposits or access capital markets on favorable terms or if we experience an increase in our borrowing costs or otherwise fail to manage our liquidity effectively our liquidity results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected an inability to accept or maintain deposits in the future could materially adversely affect our liquidity position and our ability to fund our business a major source of our funds is customer deposits primarily in the form of savings accounts certificates of deposits money market accounts and checking accounts we obtain deposits from consumers either directly or through affinity relationships and through thirdparty securities brokerage firms that offer our deposits to their customers we had billion in deposits acquired directly or through affinity relationships and billion in deposits originated through securities brokerage firms as of december compared to billion and billion respectively as of december our ability to attract and maintain deposits as well as our cost of funds has been and will continue to be significantly affected by general economic conditions competition from other financial services firms that use deposit funding the rates and services we offer on our deposit products and our ability to maintain a highquality customer experience may affect deposit renewal rates costs or availability changes we make to the rates offered on our deposit products may affect our profitability through funding costs and our liquidity through volumes raised in addition our ability to maintain existing or obtain additional deposits may be impacted by various factors including factors beyond our control such as perceptions about our reputation brand or financial strength quality of deposit servicing or branchless banking generally which could reduce the number of consumers choosing to place deposits with us third parties continuing or entering into affinity relationships or marketing arrangements with us disruptions in technology services or the internet generally or thirdparty securities brokerage firms continuing to offer our deposit products a severe reputational event at the company resulting in fines or additional remediation impacts may result in material deposit outflows and limit our ability to attract new deposits furthermore customers may withdraw deposits to ensure that their deposits are fully insured or make investments that have a higher yield if our customers withdraw their deposits our funding costs may increase which may reduce our net interest income and net income our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates on deposits is also dependent on capital levels of our bank subsidiary in certain circumstances the fdia prohibits insured banks from accepting brokered deposits as defined in the fdia and applies other restrictions such as a cap on interest rates we may pay see business supervision and regulation and note capital adequacy to our consolidated financial statements for more information while our subsidiary discover bank met the fdics definition of wellcapitalized as of december and has no restrictions regarding acceptance of brokered deposits or setting of interest rates there can be no assurance that it will continue to meet this definition additionally our regulators can adjust the requirements to be wellcapitalized at any time and have authority to place limitations on our deposit businesses including the interest rate we pay on deposits if we are unable to securitize our credit card receivables it may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity cost of funds and overall financial condition we use the securitization of credit card receivables as a significant source of funding as well as for contingent liquidity the securitization of credit card receivables involves the transfer of credit card receivables to a trust the transfer of the beneficial interest in those credit card receivables to a second trust through a special purpose entity and the issuance by the second trust of notes to thirdparty investors collateralized by the beneficial interest in the transferred credit card receivables our average level of credit card securitized borrowings from third parties was billion and billion for the years ended december and respectively there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete additional credit card securitization transactions if the credit card securitization market experiences significant and prolonged disruption or volatility our ability to raise funding through the securitization market also depends in part on the credit ratings of the securities we issue from our securitization trusts if we are not able to satisfy rating agency requirements to confirm the ratings of assetbacked securities issued by our trusts at the time of a new issuance of securities it could limit our ability to access the securitization markets additional factors affecting the extent to which we may securitize our credit card receivables in the future include the overall credit quality of our credit card receivables the costs of securitizing our credit card receivables the demand for credit card assetbacked securities and the legal regulatory accounting or tax rules affecting securitization transactions and assetbacked securities generally a prolonged inability to securitize our credit card receivables or an increase in the costs of such issuances that would make such activities economically infeasible may require us to seek alternative funding sources which may be less efficient and more expensive than raising capital via securitization transactions and may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity cost of funds and overall financial condition the occurrence of events that result in the early amortization of our existing credit card securitization transactions or an inability to delay the accumulation of principal collections for our existing credit card securitization transactions would materially adversely affect our liquidity our liquidity and cost of funds would be materially adversely affected by the occurrence of events that could result in the early amortization of our existing credit card securitization transactions our credit card securitization transactions are structured as revolving transactions that do not distribute to securitization investors their share of monthly principal payments received on the underlying receivables during the revolving period and instead use those principal payments to fund the purchase of new credit card receivables the occurrence of an early amortization event may result in termination of the revolving periods of one or more of our securitization transactions which would require us to repay the affected outstanding securitized borrowings out of principal collections without regard to the original payment schedule early amortization events include for example insufficient cash flows in the securitized pool of credit card receivables to meet contractual requirements ie excess spread less than zero and certain breaches of representations warranties or covenants in the agreements relating to the securitization transactions for more information on excess spread see note credit card and private student loan securitization activities to our consolidated financial statements an early amortization event would negatively impact our liquidity and require us to rely on alternative funding sources which may or may not be available at the time or may be less efficient and more expensive an early amortization event also could impact our ability to access the undrawn secured credit facilities that we maintain for contingent liquidity purposes additionally the occurrence of an early amortization event with respect to any of our securitization transactions may adversely impact investor demand for notes issued in our future credit card securitization transactions our credit card securitization structure includes a requirement that we accumulate principal collections into a restricted account in the amount of scheduled maturities on a pro rata basis over the months prior to a securitys maturity date we have the option under our credit card securitization documents to shorten this accumulation period subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions historically we have exercised this option to shorten the accumulation period to a few months prior to maturity if we were to determine that the payment rate on the underlying credit card receivables would not support a short accumulation period we would need to begin accumulating principal cash flows earlier than we have historically a lengthening of the accumulation period could negatively impact our liquidity requiring management to implement mitigating measures during periods of significant maturity levels absent management actions the lengthening of the accumulation period could materially adversely affect our financial condition a downgrade in the credit ratings of our or our subsidiaries securities could materially adversely affect our liquidity results of operations and financial condition we along with discover bank are regularly evaluated by the ratings agencies their ratings for our longterm debt and other securities including assetbacked securities issued by our securitization trusts are based on a number of factors that may change from time to time including our financial strength as well as factors that may not be within our control factors that affect our unsecured credit ratings include but are not limited to the macroeconomic environment in which we operate and the credit ratings of the us government the credit quality and performance of our assets the amount and quality of our capital the level and stability of our earnings and the structure and amount of our liquidity in addition to these factors the ratings of our assetbacked securities are also based on the quality of the underlying receivables and the credit enhancement structure of the trusts downgrades in our ratings those of discover bank or our assetbacked securities could occur at any time and without notice by any of the rating agencies which could among other things materially adversely affect our cost of funds access to capital and funding and overall financial condition there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings or that our credit ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn we may not be successful in managing the investments in our liquidity investment portfolio and investment performance may deteriorate due to market fluctuations which would adversely affect our business and financial condition we must effectively manage the risks of the investments in our liquidity investment portfolio which is composed of cash and cash equivalents and highquality liquid investments the value of our investments may be adversely affected by market fluctuations including changes in interest rates prices prepayment rates credit risk premiums and overall market liquidity also investments backed by collateral could be adversely impacted by changes in the value of the underlying collateral in addition economic conditions may cause certain of the obligors counterparties and underlying collateral on our investments to incur losses of their own or default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons thereby increasing our credit risk exposure to these investments these risks could result in a decrease in the value of our investments which could negatively impact our financial condition these risks could also restrict our access to funding while the securities in our investment portfolio are currently limited to obligations of highquality sovereign and governmentsponsored issuers we may choose to expand the range of our investments over time which may result in greater fluctuations in market value while we expect these investments to be readily convertible into cash and do not believe they present a material increase to our risk profile or will have a material impact on our riskbased capital ratios they are subject to certain market fluctuations that may reduce the ability to fully convert them into cash changes in the level of interest rates could materially adversely affect our earnings changes in interest rates cause our net interest income to increase or decrease as some of our assets and liabilities carry interest rates that fluctuate with market benchmarks through july shortterm interest rates continued to rise as the federal reserve tightened monetary policy further although us economic growth remained strong in financial market participants and the federal reserve board expect that growth will decelerate in while inflationary pressures and labor market conditions normalize leading to potential reductions in the federal funds target rate range throughout the year the timing and pace of interest rate changes is uncertain however and will largely depend on trends in inflation employment and other macroeconomic factors higher interest rates could negatively impact our customers as total debt service payments would increase impede our ability to grow our consumer lending businesses and increase the cost of our funding which would put us at a disadvantage as compared to some of our competitors that have less expensive funding sources some of our consumer loan receivables bear interest at a fixed rate or do not earn interest and we are not able to increase the rate on those loans to offset any higher cost of funds which could materially reduce earnings at the same time some of our variablerate loan receivables are subject to a cap exposing us to interestrate risk in addition we utilize a combination of fixed and variablerate funding from various sources and we may use derivative instruments to hedge the liabilities however timing mismatches between loan receivable growth and funding procurement could expose us to interestrate risk interest rates may also adversely impact our delinquency and chargeoff rates many consumer lending products bear interest rates that fluctuate with certain base lending rates published in the market such as the prime rate and secured overnight financing rate as a result higher interest rates often lead to higher payment requirements by consumers under obligations to us and other lenders which may reduce their ability to remain current on their obligations to us and thereby lead to loan delinquencies and additions to our credit loss provision which could materially adversely affect our earnings we continually monitor interest rates and have a number of tools including the composition of our loans and investments liability terms and interest rate derivatives to manage our interest rate risk exposure changes in market assumptions regarding future interest rates could significantly impact our interest rate risk strategy our financial position and results of operations if our interest rate risk management strategies are not appropriately monitored or executed these activities may not effectively mitigate our interest rate sensitivity or have the desired impact on our results of operations or financial condition for information related to interest rate risk sensitivities see item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk operational and other risk our risk management framework and models for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating our risk of loss our risk management framework seeks to identify and mitigate risk and appropriately balance risk and return we have established processes and procedures intended to identify measure manage monitor and report the types of risk to which we are subject including credit risk market risk liquidity risk operational risk compliance and legal risk and strategic risk we seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a framework of policies procedures limits and reporting requirements management of our risks in some cases depends upon the use of analytical andor forecasting models we use a variety of models to manage and inform decisionmaking with respect to customers and for the measurement of risk including credit market and operational risks and for our finance and treasury functions models used by discover can vary in their complexity and are designed to identify measure and mitigate risks at various levels such as loanlevel portfolio segments entire portfolios and products these models use a set of computational rules to generate numerical estimates of uncertain values to be used for assessment of price financial forecasts and estimates of credit interest rate market and operational risk these models and the quality of their outputs are dependent on the quality and accuracy of the data loaded into the models to the extent that the quality and integrity of that data is compromised the models could result in inaccurate forecasts ineffective risk management practices or inaccurate risk reporting all models carry some level of uncertainty that introduces risks in the estimates if the models that we use to mitigate risks are inadequate or do not accurately predict future outcomes we may incur increased losses in addition there may be risks that exist or that develop in the future that we have not appropriately anticipated identified or mitigated if our risk management framework and models do not effectively identify or mitigate our risks we could suffer unexpected losses and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if the security of our systems or the systems of third parties we rely upon is compromised our business could be disrupted and we may be subject to significant financial exposure liability and damage to our reputation our digital banking and network operations rely heavily on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential or sensitive information about us our customers and third parties with whom we do business information security risks for financial institutions have increased and continue to increase in part because of the proliferation of new technologies the use of the internet and cloud mobile and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime activists hackers terrorist organizations nation state actors and other external parties those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees customers or other users of our systems including third parties to disclose confidential or sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers our technologies systems networks and software those of other financial institutions and other firms such as hardware vendors cloud providers and others have been and are likely to continue to be the target of increasingly frequent cyberattacks malicious code ransomware denial of service attacks phishing and other social engineering other remote access attacks and physical attacks that could result in unauthorized access misuse loss unavailability or destruction of data including confidential customer information account takeovers identity theft and fraud unavailability of service or other events these types of threats may derive from human error fraud or malice on the part of external or internal parties or may result from technological failure or otherwise further our vulnerability to these types of threats may be increased to the extent employees work remotely or in hybrid work arrangements despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems through our information security and business continuity programs we may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all known and unknown security threats attacks or breaches or events of these types especially because the techniques used change frequently and are becoming increasingly more sophisticated or are not recognized until launched or vulnerabilities in software or hardware are unknown or are unable to be entirely addressed even after becoming known and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources and geographic locations and may be undetected for a period of time we rely on many thirdparty service providers and network participants including merchants and as such a security breach or cyberattack affecting one of these third parties could impact us for example the financial services industry continues to see attacks against the environments where personal and identifiable information is handled for additional information see the risk factor failure to manage our relationships with thirdparty service providers could result in our revenue or results of operations being materially adversely affected our customers may use computers and mobile devices that are beyond our security control systems to access our products and services we are subject to increasing risk related to information and data security as we increase acceptance of the discover card internationally expand our suite of online digital banking products enhance our mobile payment technologies acquire new or outsource some of our business operations expand our internal usage of webbased products and applications and otherwise attempt to keep pace with rapid technological changes in the financial services industry our efforts to mitigate this risk increase our expenses while we continue to invest in our information security defenses including cybersecurity defenses if our security systems or those of third parties are penetrated or circumvented such that the confidentiality integrity or availability of information about us our customers transactions processed on our networks or on thirdparty networks on our behalf or third parties with which we do business is compromised we could be subject to significant liability that may not be covered by insurance including significant legal and financial exposure actions by our regulators damage to our reputation or a loss of confidence in the security of our systems products and services that could materially adversely affect our business cyberattacks that are successful or are perceived to be successful in compromising the data or disrupting the services of other peer financial institutions whether or not we are impacted could lead to a general loss of customer confidence which could negatively impact market perception of our products and services media reports of attempted cyberattacks service disruptions or vulnerabilities in our information systems or security procedures or those of any of the thirdparty service providers we engage could cause significant legal and financial exposure lead to regulatory and legislative intervention and cause an overall negative effect in our business for additional information on risks in this area see the risk factors below regarding fraudulent activity the introduction of new products and services the use of third parties for outsourcing technology generally and laws and regulations addressing consumer privacy and data use and security if we cannot remain organizationally effective we will be unable to address the opportunities and challenges presented by our strategy and the increasingly dynamic and competitive economic and regulatory environment to remain organizationally effective we must effectively empower integrate and deploy our management and operational resources and incorporate global and local business regulatory and consumer perspectives into our decisions and processes in order to execute on our objective to be the leading consumer bank and payments partner we must develop and implement innovative and efficient technology solutions and marketing initiatives while effectively managing legal regulatory compliance security operational and other risks as well as expenses examples include the implementation of a broader rollout of our checking product and a structure for a more competitive global network business if we fail to develop and implement these solutions we may be unable to expand quickly and the results of our expansion may be unsatisfactory in addition if we are unable to make decisions quickly assess our opportunities and risks execute our strategy and implement new governance managerial and organizational processes as needed in this increasingly dynamic and competitive economic and regulatory environment our financial condition results of operations relationships with our business partners banking regulators customers and shareholders and ultimately our prospects for achieving our longterm strategies may be negatively impacted we may be unable to increase or sustain discover credit card usage which could impair growth in or lead to diminishing average balances and total revenue a key element of our business strategy is to increase the usage of the discover credit card by our customers including making it their primary credit card and thereby increase our revenue from transaction and service fees and interest income however our customers use and payment patterns may change because of social legal and economic factors and customers may decide to use debit cards or other payment products instead of credit cards not increase credit card usage or pay their balances within the grace period to avoid finance charges we face challenges from competing card products in our attempts to increase credit card usage by our existing customers our ability to increase credit card usage also is dependent on customer satisfaction which may be adversely affected by factors outside of our control including competitors actions and legislativeregulatory changes existing legal and regulatory restrictions limit pricing changes that may impact an account throughout its lifecycle which may reduce our capability to offer lower price promotions to drive account usage and customer engagement as part of our strategy to increase usage we have been increasing the number of merchants who accept credit cards issued on the discover network if we are unable to continue increasing merchant acceptance or fail to improve awareness of existing merchant acceptance of our credit cards our ability to grow usage of discover credit cards may be hampered as a result of these factors we may be unable to increase or sustain credit card usage which could impair growth in or lead to diminishing average balances and total revenue a reduction in the number of large merchants that accept cards on the discover network or pulse network or in the rates they pay could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows discover card net transaction dollar volume was concentrated among our top merchants in with our largest merchant accounting for approximately of that net transaction volume transaction volume on the pulse network was also concentrated among the top merchants in with our largest merchant accounting for approximately of pulse transaction volume these merchants could seek to negotiate better pricing or other financial incentives by conditioning their continued participation in the discover network andor pulse network on a change in the terms of their economic participation loss of acceptance at our largest merchants would decrease transaction volume negatively impact our brand and could cause customer attrition in addition some of our merchants primarily our remaining small and midsize merchants are not contractually committed to us for any period of time and may cease to participate in the discover network at any time on short notice actual or perceived limitations on acceptance of credit cards issued on the discover network or debit cards issued on the pulse network could adversely affect the use of discover cards by existing customers and the attractiveness of discover cards to prospective customers also we may have difficulty attracting and retaining network partners if we are unable to add or retain acquirers or merchants who accept cards issued on the discover or pulse networks as a result of these factors a reduction in the number of our merchants or the rates they pay could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by merchants increasing focus on the fees charged by credit card and debit card networks merchant acceptance and fees are critical to the success of both our cardissuing and payment processing businesses merchants are concerned with the fees charged by credit card and debit card networks they seek to negotiate better pricing or other financial incentives as a condition of continued participation in the discover network and pulse network merchants and their trade groups have filed numerous lawsuits against visa mastercard american express and their cardissuing banks claiming that their practices toward merchants including issuer fees violate federal antitrust laws there can be no assurance that they will not in the future bring legal proceedings against other credit card and debit card issuers and networks including us merchants also may promote forms of payment with lower fees such as achbased payments or seek to impose surcharges at the point of sale for use of credit or debit cards merchant groups have also promoted federal and state legislation that would restrict issuer practices or enhance the ability of merchants individually or collectively to negotiate more favorable fees the heightened focus by merchants on the fees charged by credit card and debit card networks together with the doddfrank act and recent industry litigation which would allow merchants to encourage customers to use other payment methods or cards and may increase merchant surcharging could lead to reduced transactions on or merchant acceptance of discover network or pulse network cards or reduced fees any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations political economic or other instability in a country or geographic region or other unforeseen or catastrophic events could adversely affect our business activities and reduce our revenue geopolitical events natural disasters extreme weatherrelated events or other catastrophic events including terrorist attacks and pandemics may have a negative effect on our business and infrastructure including our information technology systems climate change may exacerbate certain of these threats including the frequency and severity of weatherrelated events and other natural disasters our diners club network concentrated primarily on serving the global travel industry could be adversely affected by a number of factors including international conditions travel restrictions pandemics or negative perceptions about the safety of travel that may result in an indefinite decline in consumer or business travel activity armed conflict public health emergencies natural disasters political instability or terrorism may have a significant and prolonged negative effect on travel activity and related revenue although a regionalized event or condition may primarily affect one of our network participants it may also affect our overall network and card activity and our resulting revenue overall network and card transaction activity may decline as a result of concerns about safety or disease or may be limited because of economic conditions that result in spending including on travel to decline the impact of such events and other catastrophes on the overall economy may also adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations fraudulent activity associated with our products or our networks could cause our brands to suffer reputational damage the use of our products to decrease and our fraud losses to be materially adversely affected we are subject to the risk of fraudulent activity associated with merchants customers and other third parties handling customer information the fraud environment continues to be challenging for the financial services industry in general credit and debit card fraud identity theft and electronictransaction related crimes are prevalent and perpetrators are growing ever more sophisticated more recently emerging generative ai capabilities such as synthetic voice and conversation generation introduced new fraud risks especially in the form of identity fraud while we have policies and procedures designed to address such risk there can be no assurance that losses will not occur our resources customer authentication methods and fraud prevention tools may be insufficient to accurately predict prevent or detect fraud consumer activists and regulators have sought to expand financial institutions responsibility to hold customers harmless for fraudulent transactions on their accounts we incurred fraud losses and other charges of million and million during the years ended december and respectively our risk of fraud continues to increase as third parties that handle confidential consumer information suffer security breaches acceptance of the discover card grows internationally and we expand our digital banking business and introduce new products and features our financial condition the level of our fraud chargeoffs and other results of operations could be materially adversely affected if fraudulent activity were to significantly increase furthermore highprofile fraudulent activity could negatively impact our brand and reputation in addition significant increases in fraudulent activity could lead to regulatory intervention such as mandatory card reissuance and reputational and financial damage to our brands which could negatively impact the use of our deposit accounts cards and networks and thereby have a material adverse effect on our business further fraudulent activity may result in lower license fee revenue from our diners club licensees the financial services and payment services industries are rapidly evolving and we may be unsuccessful in introducing new products or services on a large scale in response to these changes technological changes continue to significantly impact the financial services and payment services industries for example we may be unsuccessful in deploying new technologies to strengthen our credit underwriting capabilities enhance the effectiveness of our marketing efforts ensure acceptance with new payment technologies enhance customer service drive efficiencies in backoffice functions or reduce fraud the competitive mobile ewallet and tokenization spaces are expected to continue to bring risks and opportunities to both our digital banking and payment services businesses the effect of technological changes on our business is both rapid and unpredictable we depend in part on third parties for the development of and access to new technologies we expect that new services and technologies relating to the payments business will continue to appear in the market and these new services and technologies may be superior to or render obsolete the technologies that we currently use in our products and services rapidly evolving technologies and new entrants in mobile and emerging payments pose a risk to us both as a card issuer and as a payments business as a result our future success may be dependent on our ability to identify and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards and to provide payment solutions for our customers merchants and financial institution customers the process of developing new products and services or enhancing our existing products and services is complex costly and uncertain difficulties or delays in the development production testing and marketing of new products or services may be caused by a number of factors including among other things operational capital and regulatory constraints the occurrence of such difficulties may affect the success of our products or services developing unsuccessful products and services could result in financial losses as well as decreased capital availability in addition the new products and services offered may not be adopted by consumers merchants or financial institution customers also the success of a new product or service may depend upon our ability to deliver it on a large scale which may require a significant capital investment that we may not be in a position to make if we are unable to successfully introduce and support new incomegenerating products and services while also managing our expenses it may impact our ability to compete effectively and materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations failure to manage our relationships with thirdparty service providers could result in our revenue or results of operations being materially adversely affected we depend on thirdparty service providers for many aspects of the operation of our business for example we depend on third parties for software and systems development the timely transmission of information across our data transportation network and for other telecommunications processing remittance technologyrelated and other services in connection with our digital banking and payment services businesses if a service provider fails to provide the services that we require or expect or fails to meet contractual requirements such as service levels security requirements or compliance with applicable laws the failure could negatively impact our business by adversely affecting our ability to process customers transactions in a secure consistent timely and accurate manner otherwise hampering our ability to serve our customers or subjecting us to litigation and regulatory risk for poor vendor oversight such a failure could adversely affect the perception of the reliability of our networks and services and the quality of our brands and could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation revenues andor our results of operations with remote and hybrid work arrangements we have become increasingly dependent on thirdparty service providers including those with which we have no direct relationship such as our employees internet service providers if these thirdparties experience service disruptions our operations may be interrupted or negatively impacted if our key technology platforms become obsolete or if we experience disruptions including difficulties in our ability to process transactions our revenue or results of operations could be materially adversely affected our ability to deliver services to our customers and run our business in compliance with applicable laws and regulations may be affected by the functionality of our technology systems the implementation of technology changes as well as patches and upgrades to maintain current and integrated systems may result in compliance issues and may at least temporarily cause disruptions to our business including but not limited to systems interruptions transaction processing errors and system conversion delays all of which could have a negative impact on us in addition our transaction processing systems and other operational systems may encounter service interruptions at any time due to system or software failure natural disaster or other reasons such services could be disrupted at any of our primary or backup facilities or our other owned or leased facilities third parties to whom we outsource the maintenance and development of certain technological functionality may experience errors or disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited control in addition there is no assurance that we will be able to sustain our investment in new technology to avoid obsolescence of critical systems and applications a failure to maintain current technology systems and facilities or to control thirdparty risk could cause disruptions in the operation of our business which could materially adversely affect our transaction volumes revenues reputation andor our results of operations if we are unable to recruit retain and motivate key officers and employees to drive our business our business could be materially adversely affected our success depends in large part on our ability to recruit retain and motivate key officers and employees to manage and grow our business our senior management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace we believe we are in a critical period of competition in the financial services and payments industry the market for qualified individuals is highly competitive and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel or candidates to replace or succeed members of our senior management team or other key personnel or it may be expensive to do so we may be subject to restrictions under future legislation or regulation limiting executive compensation for example the federal banking agencies have previously issued proposed rulemaking on incentive compensation practices for certain employees at banking organizations including executives and may issue additional rules relating to such activities in the future these requirements could negatively impact our ability to compete with other companies in attracting hiring and retaining key personnel and offer incentives that motivate our key personnel to perform and may require us to extensively restructure certain of our existing incentive compensation practices additionally the market for individuals with skills in fields such as technology advanced analytics digital marketing and payments is increasingly competitive and we may not be able to attract and retain persons with the desired skill set or experience if we are unable to recruit retain and motivate key personnel to manage and grow our business well our business could be materially adversely affected merchant defaults may adversely affect our business financial condition cash flows and results of operations as an issuer and merchant acquirer in the us on the discover network and as a holder of certain merchant agreements internationally for the diners club network we may be contingently liable for certain disputed credit card sales transactions that arise between customers and merchants if a dispute is resolved in the customers favor we will cause a credit or refund of the amount to be issued to the customer and charge back the transaction to the merchant or merchant acquirer if we are unable to collect this amount from the merchant or merchant acquirer we will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the customer where the purchased product or service is not provided until some later date following the purchase such as an airline ticket the likelihood of potential liability increases losses related to merchant chargebacks were not material for the years ended december and damage to our reputation could negatively affect our business and brand in recent years financial services companies have experienced increased reputational risk as consumers protest and regulators scrutinize business and compliance practices of such companies maintaining a positive reputation is critical to attracting and retaining customers investors and employees damage to our reputation can therefore cause significant harm to our business and prospects harm to our reputation can arise from numerous sources including among others employee misconduct a breach of our or our service providers cybersecurity defenses litigation or regulatory outcomes failing to deliver minimum standards of service and quality compliance failures and the activities of customers business partners and counterparties social media also can cause harm to our reputation by its very nature social media can reach a wide audience in a very short amount of time which presents unique corporate communications challenges negative or otherwise undesirable publicity generated through unexpected social media coverage can damage our reputation and brand negative publicity regarding us whether or not true may result in customer attrition and other harm to our business prospects there has also been increased focus on topics related to environmental social and corporate governance policies and criticism of our policies in these areas could also harm our reputation andor potentially limit our access to some forms of capital or liquidity we may be unsuccessful in protecting or defending our brands or other intellectual property or third parties may allege that we are infringing their intellectual property rights we rely on a multifaceted strategy to protect our intellectual property that takes advantage of protection such as patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other restrictions on disclosure of confidential and proprietary information we develop our intellectual property internally and in some cases license it from third parties in addition the discover pulse and diners club brands have substantial economic and intangible value our success is dependent on our ability to promote and protect these brands and our other intellectual property our ability to attract and retain customers is highly dependent upon the external perception of our company and brands we strategically license our trademarks to business partners and network participants some of whom have contractual obligations to promote and develop our brands for example the discover card brand is now being issued by certain diners club licensees in their local markets if our business partners or other third parties do not adhere to contractual standards engage in improper business practices or otherwise misappropriate misuse or diminish the value of our brands or our other intellectual property we may suffer reputational and financial damage if we will not be able to adequately protect our brands our proprietary information and other intellectual property our business success may be adversely affected in addition third parties may allege that our developed or licensed marketing processes or systems may infringe upon their intellectual property rights given the potential risks and uncertainties of such claims our business could be adversely affected by having to pay significant monetary damages technology development expenses or licensing fees and we may have to alter our business practices or be prevented from competing effectively laws regulations and supervisory guidance and practices or the application thereof may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we must comply with an array of banking consumer lending and payment services laws and regulations in all jurisdictions in which we operate as described more fully in business supervision and regulation the risk factor entitled financial regulatory developments have and will continue to significantly impact the environment for the financial services industry which could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regulatory environment and developments in addition we are subject to inquiries and enforcement actions from states attorney general offices and regulation by federal regulators state banking regulators and the us department of justice as well as the sec and new york stock exchange in our capacity as a public company we also are subject to the requirements of entities that set and interpret accounting standards such as the financial accounting standards board the sec banking regulators and our independent registered public accounting firm which may add new requirements or change their interpretations on how standards should be applied guidance not yet issued could potentially have a material impact on business lines as well as how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations and could have an impact on regulatory capital failure to comply with laws regulations and standards could lead to adverse consequences such as financial structural reputational and operational penalties including our bank subsidiary being placed in receivership litigation exposure and disgorgement and fines as described further below for example failure to comply with antiterrorism antimoney laundering antibribery and anticorruption laws including the usa patriot act of the us foreign corrupt practices act and other laws regarding corporate conduct can expose us andor individual employees to severe criminal and civil penalties legislative regulatory and tax code changes could impact the profitability of our business activities alter consumer behavior in ways we did not anticipate require us to limit or change our business practices or our product offerings or expose us to additional costs including increased compliance costs significant changes in laws and regulations may have a more adverse effect on our results of operations than on the results of our competitors or may disproportionately benefit our competitors current and proposed laws and regulations addressing consumer privacy and data use and security could affect the competitiveness of our products and increase our costs legal or regulatory pronouncements relating to consumer privacy data use and security affect our business we are subject to a number of laws concerning consumer privacy and data use and security enacted by us and nonus governmental and regulatory authorities such as the european unions general data protection regulation the glba and the california consumer privacy act due to recent consumer data compromise events in the us which resulted in unauthorized access to millions of customers data these areas continue to be a focus of the us executive branch and congress state legislators and attorneys general and other regulators developments in this area such as new laws regulations regulatory guidance litigation or enforcement actions could result in new or different requirements on discover and other card issuers or networks that could increase costs or adversely affect the competitiveness of our credit card or debit card products see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regulatory environment and developments for more information in addition failure to comply with the privacy and data use and security laws and regulations to which we are subject including by reason of inadvertent disclosure of confidential information or the failure to provide timely notification of a disclosure could result in litigation fines sanctions penalties or other adverse consequences and loss of consumer confidence which could materially adversely affect our results of operations overall business and reputation litigation and regulatory actions could subject us to significant fines penalties andor requirements resulting in increased expenses oversight and reputation risk consumer banking and payment services institutions have historically been subject to significant legal actions both from private and government litigants in addition to regulatory actions private litigation may include class action lawsuits and commercial shareholder and patent litigation many of these actions have included claims for substantial compensatory statutory or punitive damages we have been currently are and may again be involved in various actions or proceedings brought by private litigants as well as governmental regulatory and enforcement agencies this includes the order with the cfpb pursuant to which discover is required to implement a redress and compliance plan in addition to the payment of at least million in consumer redress to consumers who may have been harmed and a million civil money penalty to the cfpb and the september consent order by the fdic with discover bank regarding its compliance management system for consumer protection laws pursuant to which discover bank has agreed to improve its consumer compliance management system and enhance related corporate governance and enterprise risk management practices and increase the level of board oversight over such matters in addition we may be subject to further actions including the imposition of additional consent orders regulatory agreements or civil money penalties by governmental regulatory and enforcement agencies regarding similar or other issues furthermore issues with or delays in satisfying the requirements of a regulatory action could affect our progress on others and failure to satisfy the requirements of a regulatory action on a timely basis could result in additional penalties enforcement actions and other negative consequences including reputational harm requiring changes to business activities and product offerings or subjecting us to material fines penalties customer restitution or other requirements resulting in increased expenses compliance with existing consent orders and any other consent orders or regulatory actions as well as the implementation of their requirements may increase our expenses require us to reallocate resources away from growing our existing businesses subject us to business restrictions negatively impact our capital and liquidity require us to undergo significant changes to our business operations products and services and risk management practices and expose us to private litigation see note litigation and regulatory matters to our consolidated financial statements for more information on current matters affecting us historically we have offered customers an arbitration clause in agreements to quickly and economically resolve disputes the arbitration clause has in some cases also limited our exposure to consumer class action litigation while still being able to resolve individual customer disputes however there is no guarantee that we will be able to continue to offer arbitration clauses in the future or that we will be successful in enforcing the arbitration clause in court legal challenges to the enforceability of these clauses
