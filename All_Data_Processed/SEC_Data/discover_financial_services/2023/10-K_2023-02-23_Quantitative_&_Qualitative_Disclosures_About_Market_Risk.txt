item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices rates indices correlations or other market factors will result in losses for an investment position or portfolio we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates interest rate risk we borrow money from various depositors and institutions to provide loans to our customers and invest in other assets and our business these loans to customers and other assets earn interest which we use to pay interest on the money borrowed our net interest income and therefore earnings will be reduced if the interest rate earned on assets increases at a slower pace than the interest rate paid on our borrowings changes in interest rates and our competitors responses to those changes may influence customer payment rates loan balances or deposit account activity as a result we may incur higher funding costs that could decrease our earnings our interest rate risk management policies are designed to measure and manage the potential volatility of earnings that may arise from changes in interest rates by having a portfolio that reflects our mix of variable and fixedrate assets and liabilities to the extent that the repricing characteristics of the assets and liabilities in a particular portfolio are not sufficiently matched we may utilize interest rate derivative contracts such as swap agreements to achieve our objectives interest rate swap agreements effectively convert the underlying asset or liability from fixed to floatingrate or from floating to fixedrate see note derivatives and hedging activities to our consolidated financial statements for information on our derivatives activity we use an interest rate sensitivity simulation to assess our interest rate risk exposure for purposes of presenting the possible earnings effect of a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates over the months from our reporting date we assume that all interestratesensitive assets and liabilities are subject to a hypothetical immediate basis point change in interest rates relative to market consensus expectations as of the beginning of the period the sensitivity simulation includes the hypothetical assumption that all relevant types of interest rates would change instantaneously simultaneously and to the same degree our interestratesensitive assets include our variablerate loan receivables and certain assets in our liquidity portfolio we have limitations on our ability to mitigate interest rate risk by adjusting rates on existing balances further competitive actions may limit our ability to increase the rates that we charge to customers for new loans at december the majority of our credit card and private student loans charge variable rates fixedrate assets that will mature or otherwise contractually reset to a marketbased indexed rate or other fixedrate prior to the end of the 12month measurement period are considered to be rate sensitive the latter category includes certain revolving credit card loans that may be offered at belowmarket rates for an introductory period such as balance transfers and special promotional programs after which the loans will contractually reprice in accordance with our normal marketbased pricing structure for assets with a fixed interest rate that contractually will or is assumed to reset to a marketbased indexed rate or other fixed rate during the next months earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date in addition for all interestratesensitive assets earnings sensitivity is calculated net of expected credit losses for purposes of this analysis expected credit losses are assumed to remain unchanged relative to our baseline expectations over the analysis horizon interestratesensitive liabilities are assumed to be those for which the stated interest rate is not contractually fixed for the next months thus liabilities that vary with changes in a marketbased index such as the federal funds rate or secured overnight financing rate sofr which will reset before the end of the next months or liabilities that have fixed rates at the fiscal period end but will mature and are assumed to be replaced with a marketbased indexed rate prior to the end of the next months are also considered to be rate sensitive for these fixedrate liabilities earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected maturity date net interest income sensitivity simulations require assumptions regarding market conditions consumer behavior and the growth and composition of our balance sheet the degree by which our deposit rates change when benchmark interest rates change our deposit beta is one of the most significant of these assumptions assumptions about deposit beta and other matters are inherently uncertain and as a result actual earnings may differ from the simulated earnings presented below our actual earnings depend on multiple factors including but not limited to the direction and timing of changes in interest rates the movement of shortterm interest rates relative to longterm rates balance sheet composition competitor actions affecting pricing decisions in our loans and deposits the mix of promotional balances in our card portfolio the level of interest chargeoffs and recoveries the influence of loan repayment rates on revolving balances and strategic actions undertaken by our management our current shortterm interest rate risk position is modestly assetsensitive we believe this position is prudent given benchmark interest rates have been prone to rise as the federal reserve has raised its federal funds rate target in response to high inflation the following table shows the impacts to net interest income over the following 12month period that we estimate would result from an immediate and parallel change in interest rates affecting all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities dollars in millions table start december basis point change nm nm table end an estimated impact on net interest income of a decrease in interest rates at december was not provided as many of our interestratesensitive assets and liabilities were tied to interest rates ie prime and federal funds that were near their historical minimum levels and therefore could not materially decrease
