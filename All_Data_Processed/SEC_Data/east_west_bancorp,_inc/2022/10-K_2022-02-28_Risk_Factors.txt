item risk factors we are exposed to a variety of risks some of which are inherent to the financial services industry and others of which are more specific to our businesses our enterprise risk management erm program incorporates risk management throughout the organization in identifying managing monitoring and reporting risks our erm program identifies the companys major risk categories as capital risk market risk liquidity risk credit risk operational risk compliance risk legal risk strategic risk and reputational risk erm is comprised of our senior management and chaired by our chief risk officer the discussion below addresses material factors of which we are currently aware that could have a material and adverse effect on our businesses results of operations and financial condition these risk factors and other forwardlooking statements that relate to future events expectations trends and operating periods involve certain factors that are subject to change and important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially these risks and uncertainties should not be considered a complete discussion of all the risks and uncertainties that we might face although the risks are organized by headings and each risk is discussed separately many are interrelated risks related to the covid19 pandemic the effects of the covid19 pandemic have impacted and may continue to impact the companys businesses financial condition liquidity capital and results of operations and the extent and duration of these impacts depend on future developments which remain uncertain and cannot be predicted the covid19 pandemic and governmental responses to the pandemic have had and will likely continue to have an impact on global economic conditions including disruption and volatility in the financial markets disruption of global supply chains temporary closures or failures of businesses increased unemployment and the imposition of social distancing and restrictions on movement in the us and other countries east west bank is considered an essential business in the eight states where we have branches or office locations as part of our continued response to the recent developments of the covid19 pandemic the company has implemented office reopening and return to office plans with various safety protocols implemented throughout our facilities we have continued to provide financial services to our customers and support to our communities throughout the pandemic the worldwide distribution of vaccines has made significant progress in containing the virus however the emergence of new variants as well as insufficient adoption and longterm effectiveness of vaccines may negatively affect our ability to resume full normal operations and provide services to our customers the prolongation of the covid19 pandemic and emergence of new variants could continue to cause disruption in global supply chains labor market shortages and increase in employment costs which in turn adversely affect the ability of the companys borrowers to satisfy their obligations if our customers experience credit deterioration including an inability to pay loans as they come due or a decrease in the value of collateral andor higher than usual draws on outstanding lines of credit our level of chargeoffs and provision for credit losses could increase further failures to contain the covid19 pandemic and the emergence of variants may decrease our borrowers confidence with respect to purchasing real estate or homes and adversely affect the demand for the companys loans and other products and services the valuation of our loans securities derivatives portfolios goodwill and intangibles the carrying value of our deferred tax assets our capital levels and liquidity and our results of operations market declines or volatility due to the covid19 pandemic could have material impacts on the value of securities derivatives and other financial instruments which the company owns the company executes transactions with various counterparties in the financial industry including brokerdealers commercial banks and investment banks any defaults by such financial services institutions or uncertainty in the financial services industry in general could lead to marketwide liquidity problems and may expose the company to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparties or clients and further increase the possibility of downgrades in the companys credit ratings additionally changes in the governments monetary policy addressing the covid19 pandemic could potentially have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition the extent to which the covid19 pandemic continues to impact our businesses results of operations and financial condition is uncertain and will depend on numerous evolving factors that are outside our control and cannot be accurately predicted including the scope severity and duration of the pandemic the governmental business and individual actions in response to the pandemic or the impact of those actions on global economic activities and economic conditions when the covid19 pandemic subsides the impact of the us federal government actions to mitigate the effects of the covid19 pandemic and our participation in those efforts may materially and adversely affect our businesses results of operations and financial condition the us federal government has taken significant actions to address the economic and financial effects of the covid19 pandemic the federal reserve sharply reduced interest rates and instituted quantitative easing measures as well as domestic and global capital market support programs however to help curtail rising inflation the federal reserve is expected to increase interest rates and reduce quantitative easing measures in addition congress various federal agencies and state governments have taken measures to address the economic and social consequences of the pandemic including the enactment of the cares act which among other things established various initiatives to protect individuals businesses and local economies in an effort to lessen the impact of the covid19 pandemic on consumers and businesses these initiatives included the ppp the main street lending program mslp relief with respect to tdrs mortgage forbearance and extended unemployment benefits during and the company supported its customers by offering small business administration sba loans under the ppp the bank was also a participating lender in the mslp which was established by the federal reserve to support lending to small and mediumsized businesses and nonprofit organizations that were in sound financial condition before the onset of the covid19 pandemic the companys participation in these programs could subject us to increased governmental and regulatory scrutiny negative publicity or increased exposure to litigation which could increase our operational legal and compliance costs and damage our reputation moreover if the federal stimulus measures are not effective in mitigating the effect of the covid19 pandemic credit issues for our loan customers may be severe and adversely affect our businesses results of operations and financial condition more substantially over a longer period in response to the covid19 pandemic us federal banking regulatory agencies have encouraged lenders to extend additional loans and the federal government has enacted legislation supporting various sectors including small businesses however the full impact on our business activities as a result of government and regulatory policies programs and guidelines as well as regulators reactions to such activities remains uncertain risks related to geopolitical uncertainties unfavorable general economic political or industry conditions either domestically or internationally may adversely affect our businesses results of operations and financial condition our businesses and results of operations are affected by the financial markets and general economic conditions globally particularly in the us and china including factors such as the level and volatility of shortterm and longterm interest rates inflation deflation home prices collateral asset prices unemployment and underemployment levels bankruptcies household income consumer behavior fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets and currencies liquidity of the global financial markets the availability and cost of capital and credit investor sentiment and confidence in the financial markets and sustainability of economic growth in the us and china the deterioration of any of these conditions could adversely affect our consumer and commercial businesses securities and derivatives portfolios the level of chargeoffs and provision for credit losses the carrying value of deferred tax assets capital levels liquidity and results of operations in addition because the companys operations and the collateral securing its real estate lending portfolio are primarily concentrated in northern and southern california the company may be particularly susceptible to adverse economic conditions in the state of california any unfavorable changes in economic and market conditions in california and other regions where we operate could lead to the following outcomes greater than expected losses in the companys credit exposure due to unforeseen economic conditions which may in turn adversely impact the companys results of operations and financial condition failure of the companys commercial and residential borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans or a decrease in the value of real estate collateral securing the payment of such loans which could result in credit losses delinquencies foreclosures and customer bankruptcies and in turn have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations and financial condition a decrease in deposit balances and the demand for loans and other products and services future disruptions in the capital markets or other events including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations which may result in an inability to borrow on favorable terms or at all from other financial institutions an adverse effect on the value of the afs debt securities portfolio as a result of debt defaults and a loss of confidence in the financial services industry our market sector and the equity markets by investors placing pressure on the companys stock price changes in the economic and political relations between the us and china including trade policies and the imposition of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs may adversely impact the companys businesses results of operations and financial condition economic trade and political tensions including tariffs and other punitive trade policies and disputes between the us and china pose a risk to the businesses of the company and its customers the imposition of tariffs retaliatory tariffs or other trade restrictions on products and materials that the companys customers import or export could cause the prices of their products to increase possibly reduce demand and hence may negatively impact the companys customers margins and their ability to service debt the company may also experience a decrease in the demand for loans and other financial products or experience a deterioration in the credit quality of the loans extended to the customer in industry sectors that are most sensitive to the tariffs we face risks associated with international operations a substantial number of our customers have economic and cultural ties to asia the banks international presence includes four fullservice branches and four representative offices in china our presence in china carries certain risks including risks arising from the uncertainty regarding our ability to generate revenues from foreign operations risks associated with leveraging and conducting business on an international basis including among others legal regulatory and tax requirements and restrictions crossborder trade restrictions or tariffs uncertainties regarding liability trade barriers difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations political and economic risks and financial risks including currency and payment risks further volatility in the shanghai and hong kong stock exchanges andor a potential fall in real estate prices in china among other things may negatively impact asset values and the profitability and liquidity of the companys customers operating in this region these risks could adversely affect the success of our international operations and could have a material adverse effect on our overall business results of operations and financial condition in addition we face risks that our employees and affiliates may fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing our international operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act anticorruption laws and other us and foreign laws and regulations failure to comply with such laws and regulations could among other things result in enforcement actions and fines against us as well as limitations on our conduct any of which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations and financial condition natural disasters and geopolitical events beyond the companys control as well as the impacts of climate change could adversely affect the company natural disasters such as wildfires earthquakes extreme weather conditions hurricanes floods widespread health emergencies or pandemics and other acts of nature and geopolitical events involving political unrest terrorism or military conflicts could adversely affect the companys business operations and those of the companys customers and cause substantial damage and loss to real and personal property for example california in which the companys operations and the collateral securing its real estate lending portfolio are concentrated contains active earthquake zones and has been and continues to be subject to numerous devastating wildfires natural disasters may be more frequent or severe due to the effects of climate change which may include altered distribution and intensity of rainfall prolonged droughts or flooding increased frequency of wildfires rising sea levels and a rising heat index additionally our business and operations have been affected by the ongoing covid19 pandemic and could be adversely affected by the effects of epidemics or pandemics or other adverse public health developments temporary closures of our branches and offices or a reduction of consumer spending could adversely impact our operating results and the performance of loans to impacted borrowers in the us or china these natural disasters and geopolitical events could impair borrowers ability to service their loans decrease the level and duration of deposits by customers erode the value of loan collateral and result in an increase in the amount of nonperforming assets net chargeoffs and provision for credit losses risks arising from climate change including physical risks and transition risks could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations climate change could present financial risks to us through changes in the physical climate that affect our operations directly or that impact our customers or collateral climate change also could present financial risks to us as a result of transition risks such as societal andor technological responses to climate change which could include changes in climate policy or in the regulation of financial institutions with respect to risks posed by climate change these climaterelated physical risks and transition risks could have a financial impact on us both directly on our business and operations and as a result of material adverse impacts to our customers including declines in asset values reduced availability of insurance significant interruptions to business operations and negative consequences to business models and the need to make changes in response to those consequences the risks of regulatory changes and compliance requirements related to climate change may impose operational burdens and increased compliance costs capital requirements or the risk of litigation which could adversely affect the companys businesses results of operations and financial condition risks related to financial matters a significant portion of the companys loan portfolio is secured by real estate and thus the company has a higher degree of risk from a downturn in real estate markets because many of the companys loans are secured by real estate a decline in the real estate markets could impact the companys business and financial condition real estate values and real estate markets are generally affected by changes in general economic conditions fluctuations in interest rates and the availability of loans to potential purchasers changes in tax laws and other governmental statutes regulations and policies and natural disasters such as wildfires and earthquakes which are particularly prevalent in california where a significant portion of the companys real estate collateral is located if real estate values decline the value of real estate collateral securing the companys loans could be significantly reduced the companys ability to recover on defaulted loans by foreclosing and selling the real estate collateral would be further diminished and the company would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans furthermore commercial real estate cre and multifamily residential loans typically involve large balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers since payments on these loans are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties as well as the business and financial condition of the borrowers repayment of such loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market adverse economic conditions or changes in applicable government regulations borrowers inability to repay such loans may have an adverse effect on the companys businesses results of operations and financial condition the companys businesses are subject to interest rate risk and variations in interest rates may have a material adverse effect on the companys financial performance our financial results depend substantially on net interest income which is the difference between the interest income we earn on interestearning assets and the interest expense we pay on interestbearing liabilities interestearning assets primarily include loans extended securities held in our investment portfolio and excess cash held to manage shortterm liquidity we fund our assets using deposits and borrowings while we offer interestbearing deposit products a portion of our deposit balances are from noninterestbearing products overall the interest rates we receive on our interestearning assets and pay on our interestbearing liabilities could be affected by a variety of factors including market interest rate changes in response to inflation competition regulatory requirements and a change in our product mix changes in key variable market interest rates such as the federal funds national prime or treasury rates generally impact our interest rate spread because of the differences in maturities and repricing characteristics of the companys interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities changes in interest rates do not produce equivalent changes in interest income earned on interestearning assets and interest expense paid on interestbearing liabilities rising interest rates may cause our funding costs to increase at a faster pace than the yield we earn from our assets ultimately causing our net interest margin to decrease higher interest rates may also result in lower mortgage production and increased chargeoffs in certain segments of the loan portfolio such as cre and home equity in contrast declining interest rates would increase the banks lending capacity decrease funding cost increase prepayments of loans and mortgage related securities as borrowers refinance to reduce borrowing costs accordingly changes in levels of interest rates could materially and adversely affect our net interest income net interest margin cost of deposits loan origination volume average loan portfolio balance asset quality liquidity and overall profitability reforms to and uncertainty regarding libor may adversely affect our business the united kingdoms financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced that after specified dates libor settings will cease to be provided by any administrator as of december the oneweek and twomonth tenors of usd libor ceased to be published the overnight one three six and 12month usd libor tenors will continue to be calculated using panel bank submissions for the purpose of legacy contracts and will permanently cease on june banking regulators have increased regulatory scrutiny and intensified supervisory focus of financial institutions libor transition plans preparations and readiness including the use of creditsensitive rates the us federal banking agencies issued guidance to strongly encourage banking organizations to cease using usd libor as a reference rate in new contracts by december in connection with this the company ceased extending new libor loans during the fourth quarter of and began offering new variable rate loans based on alternative reference rates the libor transition is anticipated to continue through june the company created a crossfunctional team to manage the communication of the companys transition plans with both internal and external stakeholders the crossfunctional team also helps ensures that the company appropriately updates its business processes analytical tools information systems and contract language to minimize disruption during and after the libor transition since the volume of our products that are indexed to libor is significant the transition if not sufficiently planned for and managed by our crossfunctional teams could impact the financial performance of previously recorded transactions requiring different hedging strategies result in our hedges being ineffective or impact the availability of cost of floating rate funding affect our liquidity and capital planning and management or other adverse financial consequences although the implementation of the secured overnight financing rate sofr index is intended to have minimal economic effect on the parties to a liborbased contract the transition from libor to a new benchmark rate could result in significant increased systems compliance operational and legal costs increased scrutiny from regulators reputational harm or other adverse consequences inconsistent approaches to a transition from libor to an alternative rate among different market participants and for different financial products may cause market disruption and operational problems which could adversely affect us this may include exposure to increased basis risk increased possibility of disagreements with counterparties and the resulting costs in connection with remediating these problems this transition may also result in our customers challenging the determination of their interest payments entering into fewer transactions or postponing their financing needs or disputing the interpretation of implementation of contract fallback provisions and other transition related changes which could reduce the companys revenue and adversely impact our business in addition the transition from libor to another benchmark rate or rates could have adverse impacts on floatingrate obligations such as loans deposits derivatives and other financial instruments that currently use libor as a benchmark rate and ultimately adversely affect the companys results of operations and financial condition for additional information on the discontinuation of libor refer to item mda other matters the monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our earnings the federal reserve board regulates the supply of money and credit in the us its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing and affect the return earned on those loans and investments both of which in turn affect our net interest margin they can also materially decrease the value of financial assets we hold federal reserve policies may also adversely affect borrowers potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans or could adversely create asset bubbles which result from prolonged periods of accommodative policy this in turn may result in volatile markets and rapidly declining collateral values changes in federal reserve policies are beyond our control consequently the impact of these changes on our businesses and results of operations is difficult to predict the company is subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the companys foreign currency translation exposure relates primarily to its china subsidiary that has its functional currency denominated in chinese renminbi rmb in addition as the company continues to expand its businesses in china and hong kong certain transactions are conducted in currencies other than the usd although the company has entered into derivative instruments to offset the impact of the foreign exchange fluctuations given the volatility of exchange rates there is no assurance that the company will be able to effectively manage foreign currency translation risk fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material unfavorable impact on the companys net income therefore adversely affecting the companys businesses results of operations and financial condition risks related to our capital resources and liquidity as a regulated entity we are subject to capital requirements and a failure to meet these standards could adversely affect our financial condition the company and the bank are subject to certain capital and liquidity rules including the basel iii capital rules which establish the minimum capital adequacy requirements and may require us to increase our regulatory capital or liquidity targets increase regulatory capital ratios or change how we calculate regulatory capital we may be required to increase our capital levels even in the absence of actual adverse economic conditions or forecasts and enhance capital planning based on hypothetical future adverse economic scenarios as of december we met the requirements of the basel iii capital rules including the capital conservation buffer compliance with these capital requirements may limit capitalintensive operations and increase operational costs and we may be limited or prohibited from distributing dividends or repurchasing our stock this could adversely affect our ability to expand or maintain present business levels which may adversely affect our businesses results of operations and financial condition additional information on the regulatory capital requirements applicable to the company and the bank is set forth in item business supervision and regulation regulatory capital requirements in this positions for which the final determination of tax is uncertain and our income tax expense could be increased if a federal state or local authority were to assess additional taxes that have not been provided for in our consolidated financial statements there can be no assurance that we will achieve our anticipated effective tax rate the us government could further introduce new tax legislation or amend current tax laws that would adversely affect the company in addition the presidents proposed budget negotiations with congress over the details of the budget and the terms of the approved budget could create uncertainty about the us economy ultimately having an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition the companys investments in certain taxadvantaged projects may not generate anticipated returns and may have an adverse impact on the companys results of operations the company invests in certain taxadvantaged investments that support qualified affordable housing projects community development and renewable energy resources the companys investments in these projects are designed to generate a return primarily through the realization of federal and state income tax credits and other tax benefits over specified time periods but such returns are not guaranteed the company remains subject to the risk that previously recorded tax credits which remain subject to recapture by taxing authorities based on compliance features required to be met at the project level may fail to meet certain government compliance requirements and may not be able to be realized the companys ability to realize tax credits and other tax benefits depends on many factors outside the companys control including changes in the applicable tax code and the ability of the projects to be completed failure to realize anticipated tax credits and other tax benefits may have a negative impact on the companys business results of operations and financial condition general risk factors antitakeover provisions could negatively impact the companys stockholders provisions of delaware and california law and of the companys certificate of incorporation as amended and bylaws as amended and restated could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of the company or could have the effect of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire control of the company for example the companys certificate of incorporation as amended requires the approval of the holders of at least twothirds of the outstanding shares of voting stock to approve certain business combinations the company is also subject to section of the delaware general corporation law which would make it more difficult for another party to acquire the company without the approval of the board of directors additionally the companys certificate of incorporation as amended authorizes the board of directors to issue preferred stock which could be issued as a defensive measure in response to a takeover proposal further prior approval of the federal reserve and the dfpi is required for any person to acquire control of the company and control for these purposes may be presumed to exist when a person owns or more of our outstanding common stock federal reserve approval is also required for a bank holding company to acquire more than of our outstanding common stock these and other provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the company even if an acquisition might be in the best interest of the stockholders managing reputational risk is important to attracting and maintaining customers investors and employees threats to the companys reputation can come from many sources including unethical practices employee misconduct failure to deliver minimum standards of service or quality compliance deficiencies and questionable or fraudulent activities of the companys customers the company has policies and procedures including the companys code of conduct in place to govern the personal conduct action and work relationship of our employees with customers fellow employees competitors governmental officials and suppliers under both official and unofficial situations in which employees may reasonably be perceived by others as acting as representatives of the company in addition employees who fail to comply with the code of conduct may be subject to disciplinary action termination of employment andor prosecution however these policies and procedures may not be fully effective negative publicity regarding the companys businesses employees or customers with or without merit may result in the loss of customers investors and employees costly litigation a decline in revenues and increased governmental scrutiny the price of the companys common stock may be volatile or may decline the price of the companys common stock may fluctuate in response to various factors some of which are outside the companys control these factors include the risk factors discussed herein as well as actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in the companys results of operations and financial condition changes in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts and rating agencies speculation in the press or investment community strategic actions by the company or its competitors such as acquisitions or restructurings actions by institutional stockholders addition or departure of key personnel fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of the companys competitors general market conditions and in particular market conditions in the financial services industry proposed or adopted regulatory changes or developments cyclical fluctuations trading volume of the companys common stock and anticipated or pending investigations proceedings or litigation that involve or affect the company industry factors general economic and political conditions and events such as cyber or terrorist attacks economic downturn or recessions interest rate changes credit default trends currency fluctuations changes to trade policies or public health issues could also cause our stock price to decline regardless of our operating results a significant decline in the companys stock price could result in substantial losses for stockholders impairment of goodwill could result in a charge against earnings and thus a reduction in stockholders equity the company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if necessary a significant decline in our expected future cash flows a material change in interest rates a significant adverse change in the business climate slower growth rates or a significant or sustained decline in the price of the companys common stock may necessitate taking charges in the future related to the impairment of goodwill if the company determines that a future writedown of goodwill is necessary the amount of such impairment charge could be significant and could adversely affect earnings as well as capital
