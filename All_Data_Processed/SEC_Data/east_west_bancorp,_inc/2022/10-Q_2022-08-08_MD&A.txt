risk management at the management level the companys assetliability committee alco establishes the liquidity guidelines that govern the daytoday active management of the companys liquidity position by requiring sufficient assetbased liquidity to cover potential funding requirements and avoid overdependence on volatile less reliable funding markets these guidelines are established and monitored for both the bank and for east west on a standalone basis to ensure that the company can serve as a source of strength for its subsidiaries the alco regularly monitors the companys liquidity status and related management processes providing regular reports to the board of directors the companys liquidity management practices have been effective under normal operating and stressed market conditions

company believes these afs debt securities provide quick sources of liquidity to obtain financing regardless of market conditions through sale or pledging the yeartodate decrease in liquid assets was primarily related to the transfer of billion of debt securities from afs to htm a billion decrease in cash and cash equivalents primarily to fund loans and a billion decrease in resale agreements primarily due to repayments management believes that the companys excess cash unencumbered afs debt securities borrowing capacity and access to sufficient sources of capital are adequate to meet its

liquidity to maintain at the company foreign subsidiary and foreign branch levels needed to meet contractual and contingent cash outflows under a range of scenarios scenario analyses include assumptions about significant changes in key funding sources market triggers potential uses of funding and economic conditions in certain countries in addition company specific events are incorporated into the stress testing liquidity stress tests are conducted to ascertain potential mismatches between liquidity sources and uses over a variety of time horizons both immediate and longer term and over a variety of stressed conditions given the range of potential stresses the company maintains contingency funding plans on a consolidated basis and for individual entities as of june the company was not aware of any material commitments for capital expenditures in the foreseeable future and believes it has adequate liquidity resources to conduct operations and meet other needs in the ordinary course of business given the uncertainty and the rapidly changing market and economic conditions the company will continue to actively evaluate the impact on its business and financial position for more information on how economic conditions may impact our liquidity see item risk factors of the companys form 10k market risk management market risk is the risk that the companys financial condition may change resulting from adverse movements in market rates or prices including interest rates foreign exchange rates interest rate contracts investment securities prices credit spreads and related risk resulting from mismatches in rate sensitive assets and liabilities in the event of market stress the risk could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition the boards risk oversight committee has primary oversight responsibility over market risk management at the management level the alco establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market risk management activities corporate treasury supports the alco in measuring monitoring and managing interest rate risk as well as all other market risks interest rate risk management interest rate risk results primarily from the companys traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans which are the primary areas of market risk for the company economic and financial conditions movements in interest rates and consumer preferences impact the level of noninterestbearing funding sources at the company as well as affect the difference between the interest the company earns on interestearning assets and pays on interestbearing liabilities in addition changes in interest rates can influence the rate of principal prepayments on loans and the speed of deposit withdrawals due to the pricing term mismatches and the embedded options inherent in certain products changes in market interest rates not only affect expected nearterm earnings but also the economic value of these interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities other market risks include foreign currency exchange risk and equity price risk these risks are not considered significant to the company and no separate quantitative information concerning these risks is presented herein with oversight by the companys board of directors the alco coordinates the overall management of the companys interest rate risk the alco meets regularly and is responsible for reviewing the companys open market positions and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk management of interest rate risk is carried out primarily through strategies involving the companys debt securities portfolio loan portfolio available funding channels and capital market activities in addition the companys policies permit the use of derivative instruments to assist in managing interest rate risk the interest rate risk exposure is measured and monitored through various risk management tools which include a simulation model that performs interest rate sensitivity analyses under various interest rate scenarios the model incorporates the companys cash instruments loans debt securities resale agreements deposits borrowings and repurchase agreements as well as financial instruments from the companys foreign operations the company uses both a static balance sheet and a forward growth balance sheet to perform these analyses the simulated interest rate scenarios include a nonparallel shift in the yield curve and a gradual nonparallel shift in the yield curve rate ramp over a static balance sheet in addition the company also performs simulations using alternative interest rate scenarios including various permutations of the yield curve flattening steepening or inverting results of these various simulations are used to formulate and gauge strategies to achieve a desired risk profile within the companys capital and liquidity guidelines the net interest income simulation model is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of the companys interestrate sensitive assets liabilities and related derivative contracts it also incorporates various assumptions which management believes to be reasonable but may have a significant impact on results these assumptions include but are not limited to the timing and magnitude of changes in interest rates the yield curve evolution and shape the correlation between various interest rate indices financial instruments future repricing characteristics and spread relative to benchmark rates and the effect of interest rate floors and caps the modeled results are highly sensitive to deposit decay and deposit beta assumptions which are derived from a regression analysis of the companys historical deposit data the company used full betas with each incremental rate increase in the rate ramp scenarios and did not assume lags in repricing deposit beta commonly refers to the correlation of the changes in interest rates paid on deposits to changes in benchmark interest rates the model is also sensitive to the loan and investment prepayment assumptions that are based on an independent model and the companys historical prepayment data which consider anticipated prepayments under different interest rate environments simulation results are highly dependent on input assumptions to the extent actual behavior is different from the assumptions in the models there could be material changes in interest rate sensitivity results the assumptions applied in the model are documented and supported for reasonableness and periodically backtested to assess their effectiveness the company makes appropriate calibrations to the model as needed and continually validates the model methodology and results changes to key model assumptions are reviewed by the alco scenario results do not reflect strategies that management could employ to limit the impact of changing interest rate expectations in march the federal reserve raised the target range for the fed funds rate to to to address concerns about inflation which reflected supply and demand imbalances due to the pandemic higher energy prices and broader price pressures in june the federal reserve continued its aggressive approach in responding to inflation raising the target range for the fed funds rate to to in july the federal reserve further raised the benchmark rate to to and the market estimates that interest rates are likely to continue rising potentially reaching or higher by the end of twelvemonth net interest income simulation net interest income simulation modeling measures interest rate risk through earnings volatility the simulation projects the cash flow changes in interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities expressed in terms of net interest income over a specified time horizon for defined interest rate scenarios net interest income simulations generate insight into the impact of market rates changes on earnings which help guide risk management decisions the company assesses interest rate risk by comparing the impacts of net interest income in different interest rate scenarios the following table presents the companys net interest income sensitivity related to an instantaneous and sustained nonparallel shift in market interest rates of and bps as of june and december based on a static balance sheet as of the date of the analysis change in interest rates in bps net interest income volatility june december nm nm nm nm not meaningful the percentage change represents net interest income over months in a stable interest rate environment versus net interest income in the various rate scenarios the composition of the companys loan portfolio creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to the imbalance between the faster repricing of the floatingrate loan portfolio versus deposit products growth andor contraction in the companys loans other earning assets deposits and borrowings may lead to changes in sensitivity to interest rate movements yeartodate decreases in cash and cash equivalents resale agreements and shortterm investments growth in fixedrate loans as well as changes in the funding mix have decreased the companys asset sensitivity in the table above net interest income volatility is expressed in relation to basecase net interest income which increased between june and december due to balance sheet growth and an expanded basecase net interest margin while an instantaneous and sustained nonparallel shift in market interest rates was used in the simulation model described in the preceding paragraphs the company also models scenarios based on gradual shifts in interest rates and the corresponding impacts these interest rate scenarios provide additional information to estimate the companys underlying interest rate risk the rate ramp table below shows the net interest income volatility under a gradual nonparallel shift of the yield curve in even monthly increments over the first months followed by rates held constant thereafter based on a static balance sheet as of the date of the analysis actual results will vary based on the timing and pace of interest rate changes as well as changes of the balance sheet change in interest rates in bps net interest income volatility june december rate ramp rate ramp rate ramp nm rate ramp nm nm nm not meaningful as of june the companys net interest income profile reflects an asset sensitive position net interest income is expected to increase when interest rates rise as the company has a large share of variable rate loans in its loan portfolio primarily linked to prime or libor indices the companys interest income is sensitive to changes in shortterm interest rates the companys deposit portfolio is primarily composed of nonmaturity deposits which are not directly tied to shortterm interest rate indices but are nevertheless sensitive to changes in shortterm interest rates the modeled results are highly sensitive to reinvestment yield and deposit beta assumptions actual results in terms of net interest income growth during a period of rising interest rates will also reflect earning asset growth and deposit mix changes based on customer preferences relative to the interest rate environment economic value of equity at risk economic value of equity eve is a cash flow calculation that takes the present value of all asset cash flows and subtracts the present value of all liability cash flows this calculation is used for assetliability management and measures changes in the economic value of the bank the fair market values of a banks assets and liabilities are directly linked to interest rates the economic value approach provides a comparatively broader scope than the net interest income volatility approach since it captures all anticipated cash flows the eve simulation reflects the sensitivity of the eve to interest rate changes across the full maturity spectrum of the companys assets and liabilities it identifies risks arising from repricing prepayment and maturity gaps between assets and liabilities on the balance sheet as well as offbalance sheet derivative exposure the simulation provides longterm economic perspective into the banks interest rate risk profile which allows the bank to manage anticipated negative effects of interest rate fluctuations the following table presents the companys eve sensitivity related to an instantaneous and sustained nonparallel shift in market interest rates of and bps as of june and december change in interest rates in bps eve volatility june december nm nm nm nm not meaningful the percentage change represents net portfolio value of the company in a stable interest rate environment versus net portfolio value in the various rate scenarios the companys eve sensitivity for the upward interest rate scenarios decreased as of june compared with the results as of december the changes in eve sensitivity were primarily due to faster deposit decay speed assumptions used in the model changes in level and shape of the yield curve and lower cash balances as of june the companys eve profile as of june reflects an asset sensitive eve position under the higher interest rate scenarios given the uncertainty of the magnitude timing and direction of future interest rate movements and the shape of the yield curve actual results may vary from those predicted by the companys model derivatives it is the companys policy not to speculate on the future direction of interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and energy commodity prices however the company periodically enters into derivative transactions in order to reduce its exposure to market risks primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency risk the company believes that these derivative transactions when properly structured and managed may provide a hedge against inherent risk in certain assets and liabilities or against risk in specific transactions hedging transactions may be implemented using a variety of derivative instruments such as swaps forwards options and collars prior to entering into any hedging activities the company analyzes the costs and benefits of the hedge in comparison to alternative strategies in addition the company enters into derivative transactions in order to assist customers with their risk management objectives such as managing exposure to fluctuations in interest rates foreign currencies and energy commodity prices to economically hedge against the derivative contracts entered with the companys customers the company enters into mirrored derivative contracts with thirdparty financial institutions the exposures from derivative transactions are collateralized by cash andor eligible securities based on limits as set forth in the respective agreements entered between the company and counterparty financial institutions the company is subject to credit risk associated with the counterparties to the derivative contracts this counterparty credit risk is a multidimensional form of risk affected by both the exposure and credit quality of the counterparty both of which are sensitive to marketinduced changes the companys credit risk management committee provides oversight of credit risks and the company has guidelines in place to manage counterparty concentration tenor limits and collateral the company manages the credit risk of its derivative positions by diversifying its positions among various counterparties by entering into legally enforceable master netting arrangements and by requiring collateral arrangements where possible the company may also transfer counterparty credit risk related to interest rate swaps to thirdparty financial institutions through the use of credit risk participation agreements certain derivative contracts are required to be centrally cleared through clearinghouses to further mitigate credit risk the company incorporates credit value adjustments and other market standard methodologies to appropriately reflect its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterpartys nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements of its derivatives the following table summarizes certain information about derivative financial instruments utilized by the company in its
