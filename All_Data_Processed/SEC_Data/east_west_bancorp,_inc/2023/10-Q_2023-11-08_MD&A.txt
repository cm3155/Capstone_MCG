the impact of this proposal on august the agencies jointly released a proposed rule that would require bank holding companies and nonconsolidated banks with total assets of billion or more to issue and maintain minimum amounts of longterm debt the company has total consolidated assets of less than billion and does not have significant trading activity and therefore would not be subject to the basel iii endgame requirements or the longterm debt requirements if they are finalized as proposed however by imposing additional costs on banking organizations with billion or more in total

counterparties as they come due or to obtain adequate funding at a reasonable cost to meet those obligations liquidity risk also considers the stability of deposits the objective of liquidity management is to manage the potential mismatch of asset and liability cash flows maintaining an adequate level of liquidity depends on the institutions ability to efficiently meet both expected and unexpected cash flow and collateral needs without adversely affecting daily operations or the financial condition of the institution to achieve this objective the company analyzes its liquidity risk maintains readily available liquid assets and utilizes diverse funding sources including its stable core deposit base the board of directors risk oversight committee has primary oversight responsibility over liquidity risk management at the management level the companys assetliability committee alco establishes the liquidity guidelines that govern the daytoday active management of the

management market risk refers to the risk of potential loss due to adverse movements in market risk factors including interest rates foreign exchange rates commodity prices and credit spreads the company is primarily exposed to interest rate risk through its core business activities of extending loans and acquiring deposits there have been no significant changes in our risk management practices as described in item mda market risk management in the companys form 10k interest rate risk management interest rate risk is the risk that market fluctuations in interest rates can have a negative impact on the companys earnings and capital stemming from mismatches in the companys asset and liability cash flows primarily arising from customerrelated activities such as lending and deposittaking the company is subject to interest rate risk because assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times if assets reprice faster than liabilities and interest rates are generally rising earnings will initially increase assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by different amounts short and longterm market interest rates may change by different amounts for example the shape of the yield curve may affect the yield of new loans and funding costs differently the remaining maturity of various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change for example if longterm mortgage interest rates increase sharply mortgagerelated products may pay down at a slower rate than anticipated which could impact portfolio income and valuation or interest rates may have a direct or indirect effect on loan demand collateral values mortgage origination volume and the fair value of other financial instruments the alco coordinates the overall management of the companys interest rate risk meets regularly to review the companys open market positions and establishes policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk interest rate risk management is carried out primarily through strategies involving the companys loan portfolio debt securities portfolio available funding channels and capital market activities in addition the companys policies permit the use of derivative instruments to assist in managing interest rate risk we measure and monitor interest rate risk exposure through various risk management tools which include a simulation model that performs interest rate sensitivity analyses under multiple interest rate scenarios against a baseline the simulation model incorporates the markets forward rate expectations and the companys earning assets and liabilities the company uses both a static balance sheet and a forward growth balance sheet to perform the interest rate sensitivity analyses the simulated interest rate scenarios include an instantaneous nonparallel shift in the yield curve and a gradual nonparallel shift in the yield curve rate ramp in addition the company also performs simulations using other alternative interest rate scenarios including various permutations of the yield curve flattening steepening or inverting the company uses the results of these simulations to formulate and gauge strategies to achieve a desired risk profile within its capital and liquidity guidelines the net interest income simulation model is based on the maturity and repricing characteristics of the companys interest rate sensitive assets liabilities and related derivative contracts this model also incorporates various assumptions which management believes to be reasonable but that may have a significant impact on the results these key assumptions include the timing and magnitude of changes in interest rates the yield curve evolution and shape the correlation between various interest rate indices financial instruments future repricing characteristics and spread relative to benchmark rates and the effect of interest rate floors and caps the modeled results are highly sensitive to deposit decay and deposit beta assumptions which we derive from a regression analysis of the companys historical deposit data simulation results are highly dependent on modeled behaviors and input assumptions to the extent that actual behaviors are different from the assumptions used in the models there could be material changes to the interest rate sensitivity results the key behavioral models impacting interest rate sensitivity simulations include deposit repricing deposit balance forecasts and mortgage prepayments these models and assumptions are documented supported and periodically backtested to assess the reasonableness and effectiveness the company also regularly monitors the sensitivity of the other important modeling assumptions such as loan and security prepayments and early withdrawal on fixedrate customer liabilities the company makes appropriate calibrations to the model as needed and continually validates the model methodology and results changes to key model assumptions are reviewed by the alco scenario results do not reflect strategies that the management could employ to limit the impact of changing interest rate expectations the simulation does not represent a forecast of the companys net interest income but is a tool utilized to assess the risk of the impact of changing market interest rates across a range of interest rate environments the company employs a variety of quantitative and qualitative approaches to capture historical deposit repricing and balance behaviors these historical observations are performed at a granular level based on key product characteristics including distinctions for brokered public and large commercial deposits which are then combined with forwardlooking market expectations and the competitive landscape to generate the deposit repricing and balance forecasting models the company uses these deposit repricing models to forecast deposit interest expense the repricing models provide sufficient granularity to reflect key behavioral differences across product and customer types the deposit beta is a key parameter of the deposit rate forecast the deposit beta defines the sensitivity of deposit rates to changes in the effective fed funds rate effr the company recalibrated its deposit repricing models and betas in december and qualitatively increased the long run through the cycle betas in march june and september of to better reflect increased competition and higher terminal fed funds rates than previously observed in the historical data overall the company observed a weighted average increase of the deposit beta for total deposits of approximately in march taking total deposit beta to as of march an additional in june taking total deposit beta to as of june and an additional in september taking total deposit beta to as of september these increases reflected the companys forwardlooking views of deposit rates given the expected effr at the time the company also modified deposit balance runoff models in december to better capture behavioral differences across product and customer types and carved out stable and nonstable balances to reflect the volatility and interest rate sensitivity of such deposit balances the assumptions used for the identification of stable balances were updated in june and september to reflect a larger portion of potential nonstable balances additionally to reflect changes in interest expense due to the shift from noninterestbearing to interestbearing accounts in the deposit mix the company utilized a qualitative assumption in march this assumption considered the amount of surplus noninterestbearing deposits assumed to be rate sensitive and migrated them to interestbearing deposits this assumption was included in the net interest income volatility simulations to reflect more realistic net interest income volatility in rising rate scenarios the qualitative assumption was enhanced in june with a more robust quantitative approach this updated approach incorporated internally observed historical data reflecting the evolution of noninterestbearing deposits as a percent of total deposits based on the historical behavior observed during the prior rising interest rate cycle the assumption forecasts that a portion of noninterestbearing deposits would migrate to interestbearing certificates of deposits as the 12month moving average of the overnight indexed swap rate increases in the net interest income simulations the company also makes assumptions on the yield related to the reinvestment of investment securities and the yields on new loan originations these assumptions are updated quarterly to reflect recent market conditions as well as forwardlooking expectations in march loans and deposits with cash flows indexed to china related benchmark interest rates were removed from the interest rate scenario shocks which reduced net interest income sensitivity by approximately as loan and security prepayment assumptions are key components of the companys model the company incorporates thirdparty vendor models to forecast prepayment behavior on mortgage loans and securities which have mortgage loans as underlying collateral these thirdparty vendor models have access to more comprehensive industrylevel data which can capture specific borrower and collateral characteristics over a variety of interest rate cycles the company will periodically assess and adjust the vendor models when appropriate to include its own available observations and expectations in march the company updated its version of the asset liability management simulation tool and vendor prepayment model this change updated the calibration of the vendor model to better fit recent data and better supported the transition from london interbank offered rate libor to secured overnight financing rate sofr indexed loans overall the update had minimal impact on forecasted prepayments during the third quarter the company updated the vendor prepayment model tuning factors to slow down prepayment speeds on singlefamily residential mortgages so that it better aligned with actual and expected prepayments during the third quarter the company replaced the us dollar usd libor swap curve and rates with the respective sofr swap and sofr reference rates this change had a minimal impact on the overall results of net interest income and economic value of equity eve simulations as the overall yields and discount rates were not impacted twelvemonth net interest income simulation net interest income simulation modeling measures interest rate risk through earnings volatility the simulation projects the cash flow changes in interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities expressed in terms of net interest income over a specified time horizon for defined interest rate scenarios net interest income simulations provide insight into the impact of market rate changes on earnings which help guide risk management decisions the company assesses interest rate risk by comparing the changes of net interest income in different interest rate scenarios the following table presents the companys net interest income sensitivity related to an instantaneous and sustained nonparallel shift in market interest rates by and bps as of september and december on a balance sheet assuming flat forward rates and flat loan and deposit growth on the date of analysis the nonparallel shift scenarios were calibrated internally based on historical analysis as of december the up and bps scenarios reflected parallel shifts due to the significant inversion of the yield curve while the down and bps scenarios reflected a bull steepening yield curve net interest income volatility change in interest rates in bps september december the percentage change represents net interest income change over a 12month period in a stable interest rate environment versus in the various interest rate scenarios the composition of the companys loan portfolio creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to a mismatch of repricing behavior between the floatingrate loan portfolio and deposit products in the table above net interest income volatility expressed in relation to basecase net interest income decreased as of september this decrease reflected updates to the deposit repricing assumptions and deposit product mix noninterestbearing deposit account balances are assumed to be sensitive to interest rate levels and migrate to interestbearing deposit accounts the company also models scenarios based on gradual shifts in interest rates and assesses the corresponding impacts these interest rate scenarios provide additional information to estimate the companys underlying interest rate risk the rate ramp table below shows the net interest income volatility under a gradual nonparallel shift of the yield curve in even monthly increments over the first months followed by rates held constant thereafter based on a flat balance sheet as of the date of the analysis net interest income volatility change in interest rates in bps september december rate ramp rate ramp rate ramp rate ramp as of september the companys net interest income profile reflects an asset sensitive position where assets reprice faster or more significantly than liabilities net interest income is expected to increase when interest rates rise as the company has a large population of variable rate loans primarily tied to prime and term sofr indices the companys interest income is sensitive to changes in shortterm interest rates as of september the company designated interest rate contracts with a notional amount of billion as cash flow hedges which reduced net interest income volatility by approximately of the base net interest income for every bps change in interest rate the companys deposit portfolio is primarily composed of nonmaturity deposits which are not directly tied to shortterm interest rate indices but are nevertheless sensitive to changes in shortterm interest rates the modeled results are highly sensitive to modeled behavior and assumptions actual net interest income results may deviate from the models net interest income due to earning asset growth variation and deposit mix changes based on customer preferences relative to the interest rate environment during a period of declining interest rates balance sheet growth could offset headwinds to net interest income from yield compression economic value of equity at risk eve is a cash flow calculation that takes the present value of all asset cash flows and subtracts the present value of all liability cash flows this calculation is used for assetliability management and measures changes in the economic value of the banks assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates the economic value approach provides a comparatively broader scope than the net interest income volatility approach since it represents the discounted present value of cash flows over the expected life of the instruments due to this longer horizon eve is useful to identify risks arising from repricing prepayment and maturity gaps between assets and liabilities on the balance sheet as well as from offbalance sheet derivative exposures over their lifetime this longterm economic perspective into the companys interest rate risk profile allows the company to identify anticipated negative effects of interest rate fluctuations however the difference in time horizons can cause the eve analysis to diverge from the shorterterm net interest income analysis presented above given the uncertainty of the magnitude timing and direction of future interest rate movements the shape of the yield curve and potential changes to the balance sheet actual results may vary from those predicted by the companys model the following table presents the companys eve sensitivity related to an instantaneous nonparallel shift in market interest rates by and bps as of september and december the nonparallel shift scenarios were calibrated internally based on historical analysis as of december the up and bps scenarios reflect parallel shifts due to the significant inversion of the yield curve while the down and bps scenarios reflect a bull steepening of the yield curve eve volatility change in interest rates in bps september december the percentage change represents net portfolio value change of the company in a stable interest rate environment versus in the various interest rate scenarios as of september the companys eve is expected to decrease when interest rates rise the change in eve sensitivity was due to shorter deposit durations as a result of deposit modeling assumptions slower prepayments on fixedrate mortgages and mortgagebacked securities and additional cash flow hedges to reduce net interest income volatility derivatives it is the companys policy not to speculate on the future direction of interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices however the company periodically enters into derivative transactions in order to manage its exposure to market risk primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency risk the company believes these derivative transactions when properly structured and managed provide a hedge against inherent risk in certain assets and liabilities or against risk in specific transactions hedging transactions may be implemented using a variety of derivative instruments such as swaps forwards options and collars the company uses interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in interest received on certain floatingrate commercial loans and interest paid on certain floatingrate borrowings foreign exchange derivatives are used in net investment hedging strategies to mitigate the risk of changes in the usd equivalent value of a designated monetary amount of the companys net investment in east west bank china limited prior to entering into any accounting hedge activities the company analyzes the costs and benefits of the hedge in comparison to alternative strategies the company also repositions its hedging derivatives portfolio based on the current assessment of economic and financial conditions including the interest rate and foreign currency environments balance sheet composition and trends and the relative mix of its cash and derivative positions in addition the company enters into derivative transactions in order to accommodate its customers with their business needs or to assist customers with their risk management objectives such as managing exposure to fluctuations in interest rates foreign currencies and commodity prices to economically hedge against the derivative contracts entered into with the companys customers the company enters into offsetting derivative contracts with thirdparty financial institutions some of which are cleared through central clearing organizations the exposures from derivative transactions are collateralized by cash andor eligible securities based on limits as set forth in the respective agreements between the company and counterparty financial institutions the fair value changes of the derivative contracts traded with thirdparty financial institutions are expected to be largely comparable to the fair value changes of the derivative transactions executed with customers throughout the terms of these contracts except for the credit valuation adjustment component in the contracts and the spread variances between the customer derivatives and the offsetting financial counterparty positions the company also utilizes foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to mitigate the economic effect of fluctuations in certain foreign currency onbalance sheet assets and liabilities primarily foreign currency denominated deposits offered to its customers the company is subject to credit risk associated with the counterparties to the derivative contracts this counterparty credit risk is a multidimensional form of risk affected by both the exposure and credit quality of the counterparty both of which are sensitive to marketinduced changes the companys credit risk management committee provides oversight of credit risk and the company has guidelines in place to manage counterparty concentration tenor limits and collateral the company manages the credit risk of its derivative positions by diversifying its positions among various counterparties by entering into legally enforceable master netting agreements and by requiring collateral arrangements where possible the company may also transfer counterparty credit risk related to interest rate swaps to institutional thirdparties through the use of credit risk participation agreements certain derivative contracts are required to be cleared through central clearinghouses to further mitigate counterparty credit risk where variation margin is applied daily as settlement to the fair value of the derivative contracts in addition the company incorporates credit value adjustments and other market standard methodologies to appropriately reflect the counterpartys and the companys own nonperformance risk in the fair value measurement of its derivatives as of september the company anticipates performance by its counterparties and has not incurred any related credit losses the following table summarizes certain
