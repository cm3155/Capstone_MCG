item risk factors in the course of conducting the companys businesses the company is exposed to a variety of risks some of which are inherent in the financial services industry and others which are more specific to the companys businesses the companys enterprise risk management erm program incorporates risk management throughout the organization in identifying managing monitoring and reporting risks our erm program identifies ewbcs major risk categories as market risk capital and liquidity risks credit risk operational risk regulatory compliance and legal risks accounting and tax risks strategic and reputational risks the erm is comprised of senior management of the company and is headed by the chief risk officer the discussion below addresses the most significant factors of which we are currently aware that could have a material and adverse effect on our businesses results of operations and financial condition these risks and uncertainties should not be considered a complete discussion of all the risks and uncertainties the company may face market risks unfavorable general economic political or industry conditions either domestically or internationally may adversely affect our business and operating results our businesses and results of operations are affected by the financial markets and general economic conditions in the us and greater china including factors such as the level and volatility of shortterm and longterm interest rates inflation deflation home prices unemployment and underemployment levels bankruptcies household income consumer spending fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets and currencies liquidity of the global financial markets availability and cost of capital and credit investor sentiment and confidence in the financial markets and sustainability of economic growth in the us and greater china the deterioration of any of these conditions could adversely affect our consumer and commercial businesses our securities and derivatives portfolios our level of chargeoffs and provision for credit losses the carrying value of our deferred tax assets our capital levels and liquidity and our results of operations in addition because the companys operations and the collateral securing its real estate lending portfolio are concentrated in northern and southern california the company may be particularly susceptible to the adverse economic conditions in the state of california any unfavorable changes in the economic and market conditions could lead to the following risks table start the process the company uses to estimate losses inherent in the companys credit exposure requires difficult subjective and complex judgments including consideration of how these economic conditions might impair the ability of the borrowers to repay their loans the level of uncertainty concerning economic conditions may adversely affect the accuracy of the companys estimates of losses inherent in the companys credit exposure which may in turn adversely impact the companys operating results and financial condition table endtable start the companys commercial and residential borrowers may not be able to make timely repayments of their loans or a decrease in the value of real estate collateral securing the payment of such loans could result in credit losses delinquencies foreclosures and customer bankruptcies any of which could have a material adverse effect on the companys operating results table endtable start a decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services table endtable start a decrease in deposit balances table endtable start future disruptions in the capital markets or other events including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations may result in an inability to borrow on favorable terms or at all from other financial institutions table endtable start the value of the afs investment securities portfolio that the company holds may be adversely affected by defaults by debtors and table endtable start a loss of confidence in the financial services industry our market sector and the equity markets by investors placing pressure on the companys stock price table end changes in the us and greater china trade policies including the imposition of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs may adversely impact the companys business financial condition and results of operations there has been ongoing discussion regarding potential changes to trade policies legislation treaties and tariffs between the us and greater china tariffs and retaliatory tariffs have been imposed and proposed changes in tariffs retaliatory tariffs or other trade restrictions on products and materials that the companys customers import or export could cause the prices of their products to increase and possibly reduce demand and hence may negatively impact the companys customer margins and their ability to service debt the company may also experience a decrease in the demand for loans and other financial products or experience a deterioration in the credit quality of the loans extended to the customers whose industry sectors that are most sensitive to the tariffs a portion of the companys loan portfolio is secured by real estate and thus the company has a higher degree of risk from a downturn in real estate markets because many of the companys loans are secured by real estate a decline in real estate markets could impact the companys business and financial condition real estate values and real estate markets are generally affected by changes in general economic conditions fluctuations in interest rates and the availability of loans to potential purchasers changes in tax laws and other governmental statutes regulations and policies and natural disasters such as wildfires and earthquakes which are particular to california where a significant portion of the companys real estate collateral is located if real estate values decline the value of real estate collateral securing the companys loans could be significantly reduced the companys ability to recover on defaulted loans by foreclosing and selling the real estate collateral would then be diminished and the company would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans furthermore cre and multifamily loans typically involve large balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers since payments on these loans are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties as well as the business and financial condition of the borrower repayment of such loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market adverse economic conditions or changes in applicable government regulations borrowers inability to repay such loans may have an adverse effect on the companys businesses results of operations and financial condition the companys businesses are subject to interest rate risk and variations in interest rates may have a material adverse effect on the companys financial performance our financial results depend substantially on net interest income which is the difference between the interest income we earn on interestearning assets and the interest expense we pay on interestbearing liabilities interestearning assets primarily include loans extended securities held in our investment portfolio and excess cash held to manage shortterm liquidity we fund our assets using deposits and borrowings while we offer interestbearing deposit products a portion of our deposit balances are from noninterestbearing products overall the interest rates we receive on our interestearning assets and pay on our interestbearing liabilities could be affected by a variety of factors including market interest rate changes competition regulatory requirements and a change in our product mix changes in key variable market interest rates such as the federal funds national prime libor or treasury rates generally impact our interest rate spread because of the differences in maturities and repricing characteristics of the companys interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities changes in interest rates do not produce equivalent changes in interest income earned on interestearning assets and interest paid on interestbearing liabilities increases in interest rates may result in a change in the mix of noninterest and interestbearing deposit accounts rising interest rates may cause our funding costs to increase at a faster pace than the yield we earn on our assets ultimately causing our net interest margin to decrease higher interest rates may also result in lower mortgage production income and increased chargeoffs in certain segments of the loan portfolio such as cre and home equity in contrast declining interest rates would increase the banks lending capacity decrease funding cost increase prepayments of loans and mortgage related securities as borrowers refinance to reduce borrowing costs accordingly changes in levels of interest rates could materially and adversely affect our net interest income net interest margin cost of deposits loan origination volume average loan portfolio balance asset quality liquidity and overall profitability reforms to and uncertainty regarding libor may adversely affect our business on july the united kingdoms financial conduct authority fca which regulates libor announced that it will no longer compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor by the end of this indicates that libor will be discontinued on december in june us federal reserve banks alternative reference rates committee arrc selected the sofr as the preferred alternative rate to libor sofr differs from libor in two respects sofr is a single overnight rate while libor includes rates of several tenors and sofr is deemed a credit riskfree rate while libor incorporates an evaluation of credit risk the arrc and other entities intend for the transition to be economically neutral the federal reserve bank of new york has proposed a methodology for generating sofrs of three different tenors and plans to publish an index on a daily basis beginning in the first half of the arrc has developed a methodology for adjusting sofr to reflect the risk considerations that underlie libor on july the sec issued a statement on libor transition indicating the significant impact that the discontinuation of libor could have on financial markets and market participants since the volume of our products that are indexed to libor is significant the transition if not sufficiently planned for and managed by our crossfunctional teams could adversely affect the companys financial condition and results of operations although implementation of the sofr benchmark is intended to have minimal economic effect on the parties to a liborbased contract the transition from libor to a new benchmark rate could result in significant operational systems increased compliance legal and operational costs this transition may also result in our customers challenging the determination of their interest payments or entering into fewer transactions or postponing their financing needs which could reduce the companys revenue and adversely impact our business in addition the uncertainty regarding the future of libor as well as the transition from libor to another benchmark rate or rates could have adverse impacts on floatingrate obligations loans deposits derivatives and other financial instruments that currently use libor as a benchmark rate and ultimately adversely affect the companys financial condition and results of operations the monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our earnings the federal reserve board regulates the supply of money and credit in the us its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments both of which affect our net interest margin they can also materially decrease the value of financial assets we hold federal reserve policies may also adversely affect borrowers potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans or could adversely create asset bubbles which result from prolonged periods of accommodative policy this in turn may result in volatile markets and rapidly declining collateral values changes in federal reserve policies are beyond our control and difficult to predict consequently the impact of these changes on our business and results of operations is difficult to predict we face risks associated with international operations a substantial number of our customers have economic and cultural ties to asia the banks international presence includes five fullservice branches in greater china located in hong kong shanghai shantou and shenzhen the bank has two branches in shanghai including one in the shanghai pilot free trade zone the bank also has four representative offices in greater china located in beijing chongqing guangzhou and xiamen our efforts to expand our business in greater china carries certain risks including risks arising from the uncertainty regarding our ability to generate revenues from foreign operations risks associated with leveraging and conducting business on an international basis including among others legal regulatory and tax requirements and restrictions crossborder trade restrictions or tariffs uncertainties regarding liability trade barriers difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations political and economic risks and financial risks including currency and payment risks additionally our business could be adversely affected by the effects of a widespread outbreak of disease pandemics including the recent outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus first identified in wuhan hubei province china any outbreak of disease pandemics and other adverse public health developments particularly in asia could have a material and adverse effect on our business operations these could include temporary closures of our branches and offices and reduced consumer spending in the impacted regions or in the us depending upon the severity globally which could adversely impact our operating results and the performance of loans to impacted borrowers in greater china or in the us in addition a significant outbreak of disease pandemics in the human population could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries resulting in an economic downturn that could adversely affect our customers financial results further volatility in the shanghai and hong kong stock exchanges andor a potential fall in real estate prices in china among other things may negatively impact asset values and the profitability and liquidity of the companys customers operating in this region these risks could adversely affect the success of our international operations and could have a material adverse effect on our overall business results of operations and financial condition in addition we face risks that our employees and affiliates may fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing our international operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act anticorruption laws and other foreign laws and regulations failure to comply with such laws and regulations could among other things result in enforcement actions and fines against us as well as limitations on our conduct any of which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations and financial condition the company is subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the companys foreign currency translation exposure relates primarily to its china subsidiary that has its functional currency denominated in chinese renminbi rmb in addition as the company continues to expand its businesses in china and hong kong certain transactions are conducted in currencies other than the us dollar usd although the company has entered into derivative instruments to offset the impact of the foreign exchange fluctuations given the volatility of exchange rates there is no assurance that the company will be able to effectively manage foreign currency translation risk fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material unfavorable impact on the companys net income therefore adversely affecting the companys business results of operations and financial condition capital and liquidity risks as a regulated entity we are subject to capital requirements and a failure to meet these standards could adversely affect our financial condition the company and the bank are subject to certain capital and liquidity rules including the basel iii capital rules which establish the minimum capital adequacy requirements and may require us to increase our regulatory capital or liquidity targets increase regulatory capital ratios or change how we calculate regulatory capital we may be required to increase our capital levels even in the absence of actual adverse economic conditions or forecasts and enhance capital planning based on hypothetical future adverse economic scenarios as of january we met the requirements of the basel iii capital rules including the capital conservation buffer compliance with these capital requirements may limit capitalintensive operations and increase operational costs and we may be limited or prohibited from distributing dividends or repurchasing stocks this could adversely affect our ability to expand or maintain present business levels which may adversely affect our businesses results of operations and financial condition additional information on the regulatory capital requirements applicable to the company and the bank is set forth in item business supervision and regulation capital requirements in this form 10k the companys dependence on dividends from the bank could affect the companys liquidity and ability to pay dividends east west is dependent on the bank for dividends distributions and other payments our principal source of cash flows including cash flows to pay dividends to our stockholders and principal and interest on our outstanding debt is dividend income from the bank the ability of the bank to pay dividends to east west is limited by federal and california law subject to the bank meeting or exceeding regulatory capital requirements regulatory approval is required if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year would exceed the sum of the banks net income for that year and its retained earnings for the preceding two years federal law also prohibits the bank from paying dividends that would be greater than its undivided profits in addition federal reserve guidance sets forth the supervisory expectation that bank holding companies will inform and consult with the federal reserve in advance of issuing a dividend that exceeds earnings for the quarter and should not pay dividends in a rolling four quarter period in an amount that exceeds net income for the period the company is subject to liquidity risk which could negatively affect the companys funding levels market conditions or other events could negatively affect the level of or cost of funding which in turn could affect the companys ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations or fund asset growth and new business initiatives at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences although the company has implemented strategies to maintain sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets liabilities and offbalance sheet commitments under various economic conditions a substantial unexpected or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on the companys businesses results of operations and financial condition if the cost effectiveness or the availability of supply in the credit markets is reduced for a prolonged period of time the companys funding needs may require the company to access funding and manage liquidity by other means these alternatives may include generating client deposits securitizing or selling loans and further managing loan growth and investment opportunities these alternative means of funding may not be available under stressed market conditions or realized in a timely fashion any downgrades in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity cost of funding cash flows results of operations and financial condition credit rating agencies regularly evaluate us and their ratings are based on a number of factors including our financial strength capital adequacy liquidity asset quality and ability to generate earnings some of these factors are not entirely within our control such as conditions affecting the financial services industry severe downgrades in credit ratings could impact our business and reduce the companys profitability in different ways including a reduction in the companys access to capital markets triggering additional collateral or funding obligations which could negatively affect our liquidity in addition our counterparties as well as our clients rely on our financial strength and stability and evaluate the risks of doing business with us if we experience a decline in our credit rating this could result in a decrease in the number of counterparties and clients who may be willing to transact with us our borrowing costs may also be affected by various external factors including market volatility and concerns or perceptions about the financial services industry there can be no assurance that we can maintain our credit ratings nor that they will be lowered in the future credit risks the companys allowance for credit losses level may not be adequate to cover actual losses in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap we maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for loan defaults and nonperformance and an allowance for unfunded credit commitments which when combined are referred to as the allowance for credit losses our allowance for loan losses is based on our evaluation of risks associated with our loans heldforinvestment portfolio including historical loss experience expected loss calculations delinquencies performing status the size and composition of the loan portfolio economic conditions and concentrations within the portfolio the allowance estimation process requires subjective and complex judgments including analysis of economic conditions and how these economic conditions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans current economic conditions in the us and in the international markets could deteriorate which could result in among other things greater than expected deterioration in credit quality of our loan portfolio or in the value of collateral securing these loans our allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to absorb actual credit losses and future provisions for credit losses could materially and adversely affect our operating results the amount of future losses is influenced by changes in economic operating and other conditions including changes in interest rates that may be beyond our control and these losses may exceed current estimates additionally in order to maximize the collection of loan balances we sometimes modify loan terms when there is a reasonable chance that an appropriate modification would allow the borrower to continue servicing the debt if such modifications ultimately are less effective at mitigating loan losses than we expect we may incur losses in excess of the specific amount of allowance for loan losses associated with a modified loan and this would result in additional provision for loan losses in addition we establish a reserve for losses associated with our unfunded credit commitments the level of the allowance for unfunded credit commitments is determined by following a methodology similar to that used to establish our allowance for loan losses in our loans heldforinvestment portfolio there can be no assurance that our allowance for unfunded credit commitments will be adequate to provide for the actual losses associated with our unfunded credit commitments an increase in the allowance for unfunded credit commitments in any period may result in a charge to earnings we may be subject to increased credit risk and higher credit losses to the extent that our loans are concentrated by loan type industry segment borrower type or location of the borrower or collateral our credit risk and credit losses can increase if our loans are concentrated in borrowers affected by the same or similar economic conditions in the markets in which we operate or elsewhere which could result in materially higher credit losses for example the bank has a concentration of real estate loans in california potential deterioration in the california real estate market could result in additional loan chargeoffs and provision for loan losses which could have a material adverse effect on the companys business results of operations and financial condition if any particular industry or market sector were to experience economic difficulties loan collectability from customers operating in those industries or sectors may differ from what we expected which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition operational risks a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of third parties could disrupt our businesses and adversely impact our results of operations financial condition cash flows and liquidity as well as cause reputational harm the potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout our organization and from our interactions with third parties our operational and security systems infrastructure including our computer systems network infrastructure data management and internal processes as well as those of third parties are integral to our performance in addition we rely on our employees and third parties in our ongoing operations who may as a result of human error or malfeasance or failure or breach of thirdparty systems or infrastructure expose us to risk we have taken measures to implement backup systems and safeguards to support our operations but our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to us or to the third parties with whom we interact in addition our ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to thirdparty systems is more limited than with respect to our own systems our financial accounting data processing backup or other operating or security systems and infrastructure may fail to operate properly or may become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control which could adversely affect our ability to process transactions or provide certain services there could be electrical telecommunications or other major physical infrastructure outages natural disasters such as wildfires disease pandemics earthquakes tornadoes hurricanes and floods and events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters including terrorist acts we continuously update these systems to support our operations and growth and this entails significant costs and creates risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones operational risk exposures could adversely impact our results of operations financial condition cash flows and liquidity and may result in loss of confidence significant litigation exposure and harm to our reputation a cyberattack information or security breach or a technology failure of our systems or of a third partys systems could adversely affect our ability to conduct businesses manage our exposure to risk or expand our businesses this could also result in the misuse of confidential or proprietary information increase our costs to maintain and update our operational and security systems and infrastructure and adversely impact our results of operations financial condition cash flows and liquidity as well as result in reputational harm the company offers various internetbased services to its clients including online banking services the secure transmission of confidential information over the internet is essential in maintaining our clients confidence in the companys online services in addition our business is highly dependent on the security and efficacy of our infrastructure computer and data management systems as well as those of third parties with whom we interact cyber security risks including ransomware and malware attacks for financial institutions have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies the use of the internet and telecommunication technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists nationstates and other external parties our businesses rely on the secure processing transmission storage and retrieval of confidential proprietary and other information in our computer and data management systems and networks and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties we rely on digital technologies computer database and email systems software and networks notwithstanding our defensive systems and processes that are designed to prevent security breaches and periodically test the companys security the company utilizes combination of preventative and detective controls such as firewalls intrusion detection systems data loss prevention antimalware endpoint detection and response solutions to safeguard against cyberattacks there is no assurance that all of our security measures will be effective especially as the threat from cyberattacks is continuous and severe attacks are becoming more sophisticated and increasing in volume and attackers respond rapidly to changes in defensive measures failure to mitigate breaches of security or to comply with frequent imposition of increasingly demanding new and changing industry standards and regulatory requirements could result in violation of applicable privacy laws reputational damage regulatory fines litigation exposure increase security compliance costs affect the companys ability to offer and grow the online services and could have an adverse effect on the companys businesses results of operations and financial condition we have not experienced any known attacks on our information technology systems that have resulted in any material system failure incident or security breach to date failure to keep pace with technological change could adversely affect the companys businesses the company may face risks associated with the ability to utilize information technology systems to support our operations effectively the financial services industry is continuously undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technologydriven products and services the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs the companys future success depends in part upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands as well as to create additional efficiencies in the companys operations many of the companys competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements the company may not be able to effectively implement new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on the companys businesses and in turn the companys results of operations and financial condition in addition if we do not implement systems effectively or if our outsourcing business partners do not perform their functions properly there could be an adverse effect on us there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively maintain or improve our systems and processes or utilize outsourced talent to meet our business needs efficiently any such failure could adversely affect our businesses results of operations financial condition and reputation natural disasters and geopolitical events beyond the companys control could adversely affect the company natural disasters such as wildfires earthquakes extreme weather conditions hurricanes floods disease pandemics and other acts of nature and geopolitical events involving political unrest terrorism or military conflict could adversely affect the companys business operations and those of the companys customers and cause substantial damage and loss to real and personal property for example california in which the companys operations and the collateral securing its real estate lending portfolio are concentrated contains active earthquake zones and have been subject to numerous devastating wildfires these natural disasters and geopolitical events could impair the borrowers ability to service their loans decrease the level and duration of deposits by customers erode the value of loan collateral and result in an increase in the amount of nonperforming assets net chargeoffs and provision for loan losses which could adversely affect the companys businesses results of operations and financial condition the actions and soundness of other financial institutions could affect the company financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships the company executes transactions with various counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks and investment banks defaults by financial services institutions and uncertainty in the financial services industry in general could lead to marketwide liquidity problems and may expose the company to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparties or clients further the companys credit risk may increase when the underlying collateral held cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to the company any such losses could materially and adversely affect the companys businesses results of operations and financial condition the companys controls and procedures could fail or be circumvented management regularly reviews and updates the companys internal controls reporting controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures any system of controls however well designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable but not absolute assurances of the effectiveness of these systems and controls and that the objectives of these controls have been met any failure or circumvention of the companys controls and procedures and any failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could adversely affect the companys businesses results of operations and financial condition the company is dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel may materially and adversely affect the companys prospects competition for qualified personnel in the banking industry is intense and there is a limited number of qualified persons with knowledge of and experience in the regional banking industry especially in the west coast market the process of recruiting personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to carry out the companys strategies is often lengthy the companys success depends to a significant degree upon its ability to attract and retain qualified management loan origination finance administrative marketing and technical personnel as well as upon the continued contributions of its management and personnel in particular the companys success has been and continues to be highly dependent upon the abilities of certain key executives we face strong competition in the financial services industry and we could lose business or suffer margin declines as a result the company operates in a highly competitive environment the company conducts the majority of its operations in california our competitors include commercial banks savings and loan associations finance companies brokerage firms insurance companies credit unions mortgage banks and other regional national and global financial institutions some of the major competitors include multinational financial service companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous locations and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns areas of competition include interest rates on loans and deposits customer services and a range of price and quality of products and services including new technologydriven products and services failure to attract and retain banking customers may adversely impact the companys loan and deposit growth the company has engaged in and may continue to engage in further expansion through acquisitions which could negatively affect the companys businesses and earnings there are risks associated with expanding through acquisitions these risks include among others incorrectly assessing the asset quality of a bank acquired in a particular transaction encountering greater than anticipated costs in integrating acquired businesses facing resistance from customers or employees and being unable to profitably deploy assets acquired in the transaction additional country or regionspecific risks are associated with transactions outside the us including in greater china to the extent the company issues capital stock in connection with additional transactions these transactions and related stock issuances may have a dilutive effect on earnings per share eps and share ownership regulatory compliance and legal risks changes in current and future legislation and regulation may require the company to change its business practices increase costs limit the companys ability to make investments and generate revenue or otherwise adversely affect business operations andor competitiveness ewbc is subject to extensive regulation under federal and state laws as well as supervisions and examinations by the dbo fdic federal reserve fhlb sec cfpb us and state attorneys general and other government bodies our overseas operations in greater china are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of those jurisdictions as well as supervision and examinations by financial regulators for those jurisdictions moreover regulation of the financial services industry continues to undergo major changes changes to statutes regulations or regulatory policies including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes regulations or policies could affect the manner in which ewbc conducts business in addition such changes could also subject us to additional costs and may limit the types of financial services and products we offer and the investments we make good standing with our regulators is of fundamental importance to the continuation and growth of our businesses given that banks operate in an extensively regulated environment under state and federal law in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties federal state and nonus regulators have significant discretion and power to initiate enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe and unsound practices further regulators and bank supervisors continue to exercise qualitative supervision and regulation of our industry and specific business operations and related matters violations of laws and regulations or deemed deficiencies in risk management or other qualitative practices also may be incorporated into the companys bank supervisory ratings a downgrade in these ratings or other regulatory actions and settlements could limit the companys ability to pursue acquisitions or conduct other expansionary activities and require new or additional regulatory approvals before engaging in certain other business activities failure to comply with laws regulations or policies could result in civil or criminal sanctions by state federal and nonus agencies the loss of fdic insurance the revocation of our banking charter civil or criminal monetary penalties andor reputational damage which could have a material adverse impact on the companys businesses results of operations and financial condition we continue to make adjustments to our business and operations capital policies procedures and controls to comply with these laws and regulations final rulemaking and interpretations from the regulatory authorities see item business supervision and regulation for more information about the regulations to which we are subject we face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the bank secrecy act and other antimoney laundering statutes and regulations the bsa the usa patriot act of and other laws and regulations require financial institutions among other duties to institute and maintain an effective aml program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports when appropriate we are also required to ensure our third party vendors adhere to the same laws and regulations fincen is authorized to implement administer and enforce compliance with the bsa and associated regulation it has the authority to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has been engaging in coordinated enforcement efforts with the state and federal banking regulators as well as the department of justice cfpb drug enforcement administration and the internal revenue service irs we are also required to comply with us economic and trade sanctions administered by ofac regarding among other things the prohibition of transacting business with and the need to freeze assets of certain persons and organizations identified as a threat to the national security foreign policy or economy of the us a violation of any anticorruption or aml laws and regulations could subject us to significant civil and criminal penalties as well as regulatory enforcement actions which may include restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan including any acquisition plans any violation also could damage our reputation any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and future prospects we are subject to significant financial and reputational risk arising from lawsuits and other legal proceedings we face significant risk from lawsuits and claims brought by consumers borrowers and counterparties these actions include claims for monetary damages penalties and fines as well as demands for injunctive relief if these lawsuits or claims whether founded or unfounded are not resolved in a favorable manner to us they could lead to significant financial obligations for the company as well as restrictions or changes to how we conduct our businesses although we establish accruals for legal matters when and as required by gaap and certain expenses and liabilities in connection with such matters may or may not be covered by insurance the amount of loss ultimately incurred in relation to those matters may be substantially higher than the amounts accrued andor insured substantial legal liability could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and reputation in addition we may suffer significant reputational harm as a result of lawsuits and claims adversely impacting our ability to attract and retain customers and investors moreover it may be difficult to predict the outcome of certain legal proceedings which may present additional uncertainty to our business prospects accounting and tax risks changes in accounting standards or changes in how the accounting standards are interpreted or applied could materially impact the companys financial statements the preparation of the companys financial statements is based on accounting standards established by the fasb and the sec from time to time these accounting standards may change and such changes may have a material impact on the companys financial statements in addition the fasb sec banking regulators and the companys independent registered public accounting firm may amend or reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how various standards should be applied these changes may be difficult to predict and could impact how we prepare and report the companys financial statements in some cases the company could be required to adopt a new or revised standard retroactively potentially resulting in restatements to the prior periods financial statements asu financial instruments credit losses topic issued by the fasb in june referred to as cecl requires the earlier recognition of credit losses on loans and other financial instruments based on an expected loss model replacing the incurred loss model that is currently in use the company adopted asu on january for more information related to the impacts of asu see note summary of significant accounting policies recent accounting pronouncements standards adopted in to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k the companys consolidated financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates which if incorrect could cause unexpected losses in the future pursuant to gaap we are required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements including in determining credit loss reserves reserves related to litigation and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities among other items accounting policies related to these estimates and assumptions are critical because they require management to make subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain if these estimates and assumptions are incorrect we may be required to restate priorperiod financial statements for a description of these policies refer to note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k changes to fiscal policies and tax legislation may adversely affect our business from time to time the us government may introduce new fiscal policies and tax laws or make substantial changes to existing tax legislation these changes could have a material impact on the companys businesses results of operations and financial condition the companys positions or its actions taken prior to such changes may be compromised by such changes in addition the companys actions taken in response to or in reliance upon such changes in the tax laws may impact our tax position in a manner that may result in adverse financial conditions on december the tax cuts and jobs act of the tax act was enacted and made significant changes to the us internal revenue code the tax act reformed a broad range of tax legislation affecting businesses among other things reducing the statutory corporate income tax rate from to limiting on net interest expense deduction and accelerating expensing of investment in certain qualified property it is possible that the us government could further introduce new tax legislation or amend current tax laws that would adversely affect the company in addition the presidents proposed budget negotiations with congress over the details of the budget and the terms of the approved budget could create uncertainty about the us economy ultimately having an adverse effect on our business the companys investments in certain taxadvantaged projects may not generate returns as anticipated and may have an adverse impact on the companys results of operations the company invests in certain taxadvantaged investments that support qualified affordable housing projects community development and renewable energy resources the companys investments in these projects are designed to generate a return primarily through the realization of federal and state income tax credits and other tax benefits over specified time periods due diligence review is performed both prior to the initial investment and on an ongoing basis however there may
