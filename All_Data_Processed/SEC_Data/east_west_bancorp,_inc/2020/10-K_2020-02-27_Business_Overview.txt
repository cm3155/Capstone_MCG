in this range doddfrank required that bank holding companies in this size range establish a risk committee that satisfied certain requirements and conduct an annual stresstest the stresstest requirement was extended to state member banks and other insured depository institutions as well egrrcpa lifted the size threshold for a formal risk committee from billion to billion but the federal reserve will still examine the risk management practices of companies with assets in the billion to billion range for consistency with safety and soundness and prudent practices with respect to stresstesting by the bank egrrcpa raised the asset size threshold for required testing from billion to billion regarding the company the federal reserve in rulemaking based on broad egrrcpa authority lifted the asset size threshold from billion to billion for required stresstesting bank holding companies accordingly neither the company nor the bank is now required to conduct stresstests table

recognized in tier and capital including the phase out of trust preferred securities from tier capital for bank holding companies the basel iii capital rules also prescribed a new standardized approach for risk weighting assets and expanded the risk weighting categories to a larger and more risksensitive number of categories that affect the denominator in banking institutions regulatory capital ratios under the basel iii capital rules to be considered adequately capitalized the company and the bank are required to maintain minimum capital ratios of cet1 to riskweighted assets tier capital to riskweighted assets total capital tier plus tier to riskweighted assets and a tier leverage ratio the basel iii capital rules also introduced a capital conservation buffer of that fully phased in on january that is composed entirely of cet1 on top of these minimum riskweighted asset ratios the capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress banking institutions with a ratio of cet1 to riskweighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends equity repurchases and discretionary
