item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the disclosures set forth in this item are qualified by item risk factors and the section captioned forwardlooking statements and factors that could affect future results included in item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report and other cautionary statements set forth elsewhere in this report market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and other relevant market rates and prices such as equity prices the risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values cash flows and future earnings due to the nature of our operations we are primarily exposed to interest rate risk and to a lesser extent liquidity risk interest rate risk on our balance sheets consists of reprice option and basis risks reprice risk results from differences in the maturity or repricing of asset and liability portfolios option risk arises from embedded options present in many financial instruments such as loan prepayment options deposit early withdrawal options and interest rate options these options allow customers opportunities to benefit when market interest rates change which typically results in higher costs or lower revenue for us basis risk refers to the potential for changes in the underlying relationship between market rates and indices which subsequently result in a narrowing of the profit spread on an earning asset or liability basis risk is also present in administered rate liabilities such as savings accounts negotiable order of withdrawal accounts and money market accounts where historical pricing relationships to market rates may change due to the level or directional change in market interest rates we seek to avoid fluctuations in our net interest margin and to maximize net interest income within acceptable levels of risk through periods of changing interest rates accordingly our interest rate sensitivity and liquidity are monitored on an ongoing basis by our asset and liability committee alco which oversees market risk management and establishes risk measures limits and policy guidelines for managing the amount of interest rate risk and its effect on net interest income and capital a variety of measures are used to provide for a comprehensive view of the magnitude of interest rate risk the distribution of risk the level of risk over time and the exposure to changes in certain interest rate relationships we utilize an earnings simulation model as the primary quantitative tool in measuring the amount of interest rate risk associated with changing market rates the model quantifies the effects of various interest rate scenarios on projected net interest income and net income over the next months the model measures the impact on net interest income relative to a flatrate case scenario of hypothetical fluctuations in interest rates over the next months these simulations incorporate assumptions regarding balance sheet growth and mix pricing and the repricing and maturity characteristics of the existing and projected balance sheet the impact of interest rate derivatives such as interest rate swaps caps and floors is also included in the model other interest raterelated risks such as prepayment basis and option risk are also considered alco continuously monitors and manages the balance between interest ratesensitive assets and liabilities the objective is to manage the impact of fluctuating market rates on net interest income within acceptable levels in order to meet this objective management may lengthen or shorten the duration of assets or liabilities or enter into derivative contracts to mitigate potential market risk for modeling purposes as of december the model simulations projected that and basis point ratable increases in interest rates would result in positive variances in net interest income of and respectively relative to the flatrate case over the next months while and basis point ratable decreases in interest rates would result in a negative variances in net interest income of and respectively relative to the flatrate case over the next months for modeling purposes as of december the model simulations projected that and basis point ratable increases in interest rates would result in positive variances in net interest income of and respectively relative to the flatrate case over the next months while and basis point ratable decreases in interest rates would result in a negative variances in net interest income of and respectively relative to the flatrate case over the next months we do not currently pay interest on a significant portion of our commercial demand deposits any interest rate that would ultimately be paid on these commercial demand deposits would likely depend upon a variety of factors some of which are beyond our control our december and december model simulations did not assume any payment of interest on commercial demand deposits those not already receiving an earnings credit management believes based on our experience during the last interest rate cycle that it is less likely we will pay interest on these deposits as rates increase the model simulations as of december indicate that our projected balance sheet is more asset sensitive in comparison to our balance sheet as of december the increased asset sensitivity was partly due to a decrease in the expected deposit pricing beta for rate increases on certain types of deposit accounts the deposit pricing beta is a measure of how much deposit rates will reprice up or down given a defined change in market rates management believes that the deposit pricing betas used as of december are more reflective of current expectations the increased asset sensitivity was also partly due to an increase in the relative proportion of interestbearing deposits primarily amounts held in an interestbearing account at the federal reserve and federal funds sold to projected average interestearning assets combined with a decrease in the relative proportion of fixedrate securities to projected average interestearning assets interestbearing deposits and federal funds sold are more immediately impacted by changes in interest rates in comparison to our other categories of earning assets as of december the effects of a basis point increase and a basis point decrease in interest rates on our derivative holdings would not result in a significant variance in our net interest income the effects of hypothetical fluctuations in interest rates on our securities classified as trading under asc topic investments debt and equity securities are not significant and as such separate quantitative disclosure is not presented
