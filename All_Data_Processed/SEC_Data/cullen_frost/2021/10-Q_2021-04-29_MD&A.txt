the us government ta ble of contents application of critical accounting policies and accounting estimates we follow accounting and reporting policies that conform in all material respects to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and to general practices within the financial services industry the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes while we base estimates on historical experience current information and other factors deemed to be relevant actual results could differ from those estimates we consider accounting estimates to be critical to reported financial results if i the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and ii different estimates that management reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period could have a material impact on our financial statements accounting policies related to the allowance for credit losses on financial instruments including loans and offbalancesheet credit exposures are considered to be critical as these policies involve considerable subjective judgment and estimation by management in the case of loans the allowance for credit losses is a contraasset valuation account calculated in accordance with accounting standards codification asc topic asc financial instruments credit losses that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected in the case of offbalancesheet credit exposures the allowance for credit losses is a liability account calculated in accordance with asc reported as a component of accrued interest payable and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets the amount of each allowance account represents managements best estimate of current expected credit losses on these financial instruments considering available information from internal and external sources relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the instrument relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts while historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses adjustments to historical loss information may be made for differences in current portfoliospecific risk characteristics environmental conditions or other relevant factors while management utilizes its best judgment and information available the ultimate adequacy of our allowance accounts is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control including the performance of our portfolios the economy changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward classification of assets refer to the form 10k for additional information regarding critical accounting policies overview a discussion of our results of operations is presented below certain reclassifications have been made to make prior periods comparable taxableequivalent adjustments are the result of increasing income from taxfree loans and investments by an amount equal to the taxes that would be paid if the income were fully taxable based on a federal tax rate thus making taxexempt yields comparable to taxable asset yields ta ble of contents results of operations net income available to common shareholders totaled million or per diluted common share for the three months ended march compared to million or per diluted common share for the three months ended march selected data for the comparable periods was as follows three months ended march taxableequivalent net interest income taxableequivalent adjustment net interest

dividends redemption of preferred stock net income available to common shareholders earnings per common share basic earnings per common share diluted dividends per common share return on average assets return on average common equity average shareholders equity to average assets net income available to common shareholders increased million or for the three months ended march compared to the same period in the increase during the three months ended march was primarily the result of a million decrease in credit loss expense and a million decrease in noninterest expense partly offset by a million decrease in noninterest income a million increase in income tax expense and a million decrease in net interest income credit loss expense during was impacted by both our adoption of a new credit loss accounting standard and the adverse events impacting our loan portfolio including those arising from the covid19 pandemic and the significant volatility in oil prices noninterest income during was impacted by a million net gain on securities transactions net income available to common shareholders during was also impacted by the reclassification of million of issuance costs associated with our preferred stock to retained earnings upon redemption of the preferred stock details of the changes in the various components of net income are further discussed below net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense on liabilities such as deposits and borrowings which are used to fund those assets net interest income is our largest source of revenue representing of total revenue during the first three months of net interest margin is the ratio of taxableequivalent net interest income to average earning assets for the period the level of interest rates and the volume and mix of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities impact net interest income and net interest margin the federal reserve influences the general market rates of interest including the deposit and loan rates offered by many financial institutions our loan portfolio is significantly affected by changes in the prime interest rate the prime rate began at and decreased basis points in march to where it remained through march our loan portfolio is also impacted by changes in the london interbank offered rate libor at march the onemonth and threemonth us dollar libor interest rates were and respectively while at march the onemonth and threemonth us dollar libor interest rates were and respectively the target range for the federal funds rate which is the cost of immediately available overnight funds began at to and decreased basis points in march to zero to where it remained through march as noted in our form 10k the decrease in the ta ble of contents target range for the federal funds rate in march was largely an emergency measure by the federal reserve aimed at blunting the economic impact of covid19 we are primarily funded by core deposits with noninterestbearing demand deposits historically being a significant source of funds this lowercost funding base is expected to have a positive impact on our net interest income and net interest margin in a rising interest rate environment see item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk elsewhere in this report for information about our sensitivity to interest rates further analysis of the components of our net interest margin is presented below the following table presents the changes in taxableequivalent net interest income and identifies the changes due to differences in the average volume of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities and the changes due to changes in the average interest rate on those assets and liabilities the changes in net interest income due to changes in both average volume and average interest rate have been allocated to the average volume change or the average interest rate change in proportion to the absolute amounts of the change in each the comparison between the quarters includes an additional change factor that shows the effect of the difference in the number of days in each period for assets and liabilities that accrue interest based upon the actual number of days in the period as further discussed below three months ended

period in taxableequivalent net interest income for the three months ended march included days compared to days for the same period in as a result of the leap year the additional day added approximately million to taxableequivalent net interest income during the three months ended march excluding the impact of the additional day results in an effective decrease in taxableequivalent net interest income of approximately million during the three months ended march the taxableequivalent net interest margin decreased basis points from during the three months ended march to during the three months ended march the decrease in taxableequivalent net interest income and taxableequivalent net interest margin during the three months ended march was primarily related to decreases in the average yields on loans interestbearing deposits primarily amounts held in an interestbearing account at the federal reserve and taxable securities combined with decreases in the average volumes of taxexempt and taxable securities and an increase in the average volume of interestbearing deposit liabilities the impact of these items was partly offset by increases in the average volumes of loans and interestbearing deposits primarily amounts held in an interestbearing account at the federal reserve combined with decreases in the average cost of interestbearing deposit liabilities and other borrowed funds ta ble of contents the average volume of interestearning assets for the three months ended march increased billion compared to the same period in the increase in the average volume of interestearning assets included a billion increase in average interestbearing deposits primarily amounts held in an interestbearing account at the federal reserve a billion increase in average loans of which billion related to ppp loans as further discussed below partly offset by a million decrease in average taxable securities a million decrease in average taxexempt securities and a million decrease in average federal funds sold the average taxableequivalent yield on interestearning assets decreased basis points from during the three months ended march to during the three months ended march the average taxableequivalent yield on interestearning assets during was impacted by the aforementioned changes in market interest rates and changes in the volume and relative mix of interestearning assets the average taxableequivalent yield on loans decreased basis points from during the three months ended march to during the three months ended march the average taxableequivalent yield on loans was negatively impacted by lower average market interest rates during the three months ended march compared to the same period in the average volume of loans for the three months ended march increased billion or compared to the same period in loans made up approximately of average interestearning assets during the three months ended march compared to during the same period in in april we began originating loans to qualified small businesses under the ppp administered by the sba under the provisions of the cares act in we funded billion of ppp loans as of march approximately billion of these originated ppp loans have been forgiven by the sba during the first quarter of we funded an additional billion of ppp loans during the three months ended march we recognized million in ppp loan related deferred processing fees net of amortization of related deferred origination costs as a yield adjustment and this amount is included in interest income on loans as a result of the inclusion of these net fees in interest income the average yield on ppp loans was during the three months ended march compared to the stated interest rate of on these loans for ppp loans funded through march we expect to recognize additional ppp loan related deferred processing fees net of deferred origination costs totaling approximately million as a yield adjustment over the remaining expected lives of these loans of this amount we expect to recognize approximately in and the remainder in the average taxableequivalent yield on securities was during the three months ended march decreasing basis points from during the same period in the average yield on taxable securities decreased basis points from during the three months ended march to during the three months ended march the average taxableequivalent yield on taxexempt securities increased basis point from during the three months ended march to during the three months ended march tax exempt securities made up approximately of total average securities during the three months ended march compared to during the same period in the average volume of total securities during the three months ended march decreased million or compared to the same period in securities made up approximately of average interestearning assets during the three months ended march compared to during the same period in the decrease was primarily related to an increase in the relative proportion of interestearning assets invested in interestbearing deposits primarily amounts held in an interestbearing account at the federal reserve average interestbearing deposits primarily amounts held in an interestbearing account at the federal reserve for the three months ended march increased billion or compared to the same period in interestbearing deposits made up approximately of average interestearning assets during the three months ended march compared to during the same period in the increase in the average volume of interestbearing deposits primarily amounts held in an interestbearing account at the federal reserve was primarily due to an increase in the average volume of customer deposits and to a lesser extent repurchase agreements the average yield on interestbearing deposits primarily amounts held in an interestbearing account at the federal reserve was during the three months ended march compared to during the same period in the average yield on interestbearing deposits during was negatively impacted by a decrease in interest rates paid on excess reserves held at the federal reserve average federal funds sold and average resell agreements for the three months ended march decreased million or and or respectively compared to the same period in federal funds sold and resell agreements were not a significant component of interestearning assets during the comparable periods the average yields on federal funds sold and resell agreements were and respectively during the three months ended march compared to and respectively during the same period in the average yields on federal funds sold and resell agreements during were negatively impacted by lower average market interest rates ta ble of contents the average rate paid on interestbearing liabilities was during the three months ended march decreasing basis points from during the same period in average deposits increased billion or during the three months ended march compared to the same period in and included a billion increase in average interestbearing deposits and a billion increase in average noninterest bearing deposits the ratio of average interestbearing deposits to total average deposits was during the three months ended march compared to during the same period in the average cost of deposits is primarily impacted by changes in market interest rates as well as changes in the volume and relative mix of interestbearing deposits the average cost of interestbearing deposits and total deposits was and respectively during the three months ended march compared to and respectively during the same period in the average cost of deposits during was impacted by decreases in the interest rates we pay on most of our interestbearing deposit products as a result of the aforementioned decreases in market interest rates our net interest spread which represents the difference between the average rate earned on earning assets and the average rate paid on interestbearing liabilities was during the three months ended march compared to during same period in the net interest spread as well as the net interest margin will be impacted by future changes in shortterm and longterm interest rate levels as well as the impact from the competitive environment a discussion of the effects of changing interest rates on net interest income is set forth in item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk included elsewhere in this report our hedging policies permit the use of various derivative financial instruments including interest rate swaps swaptions caps and floors to manage exposure to changes in interest rates details of our derivatives and hedging activities are set forth in note derivative financial instruments in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report information regarding the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on our derivative financial instruments is set forth in item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk included elsewhere in this report our net interest income and net interest margin have been and we currently expect them to continue to be impacted by the aforementioned decreases in market interest rates and the expectation that interest rates will remain at these low levels for some period of time in light of the ongoing economic disruption arising from the covid19 pandemic notwithstanding the foregoing our participation in the ppp as discussed above is expected to continue to positively impact net interest income and net interest margin in the near term credit loss expense credit loss expense is determined by management as the amount to be added to the allowance for credit loss accounts for various types of financial instruments including loans securities and offbalancesheet credit exposures after net chargeoffs have been deducted to bring the allowances to a level which in managements best estimate is necessary to absorb expected credit losses over the lives of the respective financial instruments the components of credit loss expense were as follows three months ended march credit loss expense benefit related to loans offbalancesheet credit exposures securities held to maturity total see the section captioned allowance for credit losses elsewhere in this discussion for further analysis of credit loss expense related to loans and offbalancesheet credit exposures ta ble of contents noninterest income total noninterest income for the three months ended march decreased million or compared to the same period in excluding the million in net gains on securities transactions during the three months ended march total noninterest income decreased million or during the three months ended march changes in the various components of noninterest income are discussed in more detail below trust and investment management fees trust and investment management fees for the three months ended march increased thousand or compared to the same period in investment management fees are the most significant component of trust and investment management fees making up approximately and of total trust and investment management fees for the first three months of and respectively the increase in trust and investment management fees during the three months ended march was primarily due to increases in investment management fees up million or and custody fees up thousand partly offset by decreases in estate fees down million real estate fees down thousand and oil and gas fees down thousand investment management fees and other custodial account fees are generally based on the market value of assets within an account and are thus impacted by volatility in the equity and bond markets the increase in investment management fees was primarily related to higher average equity valuations as well as an increase in the number of accounts the fluctuations in custody fees estate fees and real estate fees were primarily related to variation in transaction volumes the decrease in oil and gas fees was primarily due to a decrease in average production of the underlying wells at march trust assets including both managed assets and custody assets were primarily composed of equity securities of assets fixed income securities of assets alternative investments of assets and cash equivalents of assets the estimated fair value of these assets was billion including managed assets of billion and custody assets of billion at march compared to billion including managed assets of billion and custody assets of billion at december and billion including managed assets of billion and custody assets of billion at march service charges on deposit accounts service charges on deposit accounts for the three months ended march decreased million or compared to the same period in the decrease was primarily related to decreases in overdraftinsufficient funds charges on consumer and commercial accounts down million and thousand respectively overdraftinsufficient funds charges totaled million million consumer and million commercial during the three months ended march compared to million million consumer and million commercial during the same period in the decrease in overdraftinsufficient funds charges during the three months ended march was primarily related to a decrease in the volume of overdrafts relative to the same period in in april we implemented a new overdraft grace feature for certain consumer demand deposit accounts whereby no fees will be assessed on overdrafts of or less subject to certain qualifying conditions such as a minimum direct deposit overdraftinsufficient funds charges on consumer accounts during the first quarter of would have been approximately million less had the overdraft grace feature been in effect the impact on future quarters will depend on future overdraft volumes commercial service charges increased thousand during the three months ended march compared to the same period in the increase in commercial service charges was impacted by a lower earnings credit rate partly offset by decreases in the volume of billable services the earnings credit rate is the value given to deposits maintained by treasury management customers earnings credits applied to customer deposit balances offset service fees that would otherwise be charged because average market interest rates in have been lower compared to deposit balances have become less valuable and are yielding a lower earnings credit insurance commissions and fees insurance commissions and fees for the three months ended march increased thousand or compared to the same period in the increase was the result of an increase in contingent income up million partly offset by a decrease in commission income down thousand contingent income totaled million during the three months ended march compared to million during the same period in contingent income primarily consists of amounts received from various property and casualty insurance carriers related to the loss performance of insurance policies previously placed these performance related contingent payments are seasonal in nature and are mostly received during the first quarter of each year this performance related contingent income totaled million and million during the three months ended march and respectively the increase in performance related contingent income during was related to growth within the portfolio combined with improvement in the loss performance of insurance policies previously placed during the first quarter of a severe weather event in texas resulted in a significant increase in property and casualty claims and losses this deterioration in loss performance is expected to impact the determination of performance related contingent payments we receive in however such impact is not determinable at this time contingent income also includes amounts received from various benefit plan insurance companies related to the volume ta ble of contents of business generated andor the subsequent retention of such business this benefit plan related contingent income totaled thousand during the three months ended march compared to thousand during the same period in the decrease in commission income was primarily related to decreases in benefit plan commissions and commercial lines property and casualty commissions partly offset by an increase in life insurance commissions the decreases in benefit plan commissions and commercial lines property and casualty commissions were related to decreased business volumes while the increase in life insurance commissions was related to increased business

interchange and card transaction fees network costs net interchange and card transaction fees federal reserve rules applicable to financial institutions that have assets of billion or more provide that the maximum permissible interchange fee for an electronic debit transaction is the sum of  per transaction and basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction an upward adjustment of no more than cent to an issuers debit card interchange fee is allowed if the card issuer develops and implements policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve certain fraudprevention standards the federal reserve also has rules governing routing and exclusivity that require issuers to offer two unaffiliated networks for routing transactions on each debit or prepaid product other charges

management fees are the most significant component of trust and investment management fees making up approximately of total trust and investment management fees for the first three months of the increase in trust and investment management fees during the three months ended march was primarily due to increases in investment management fees and custody fees partly offset by decreases in estate fees real estate fees and oil and gas fees investment management fees and other custodial account fees are generally based on the market value of assets within an account and are thus impacted by volatility in the equity and bond markets the increase in investment management fees was primarily related to higher average equity valuations as well as an increase in the number of accounts the fluctuations in custody fees estate fees and real estate fees were primarily related to variation in transaction volumes the decrease in oil and gas fees was primarily due to a decrease in average

default and loss given default among other things the measurement of expected credit losses is impacted by loanborrower attributes and certain macroeconomic variables models are adjusted to reflect current impact of certain macroeconomic variables as well as their expected changes over a reasonable and supportable forecast period ta ble of contents in estimating expected credit losses as of march we utilized the moodys analytics march consensus scenario the march consensus scenario to forecast the macroeconomic variables used in our models the march consensus scenario was based on the review of a variety of surveys of baseline forecasts of the us economy the march consensus scenario projections included among other things i us gross domestic product gdp annualized quarterly growth

loans increased million while commercial real estate loans graded as watch and special mention decreased million while classified commercial real estate loans increased million as noted above our credit loss models utilized the economic forecasts in the moodys consensus scenario for march for our estimated expected credit losses as of march and the moodys baseline scenario for december for our estimate of expected credit losses as of december we qualitatively adjusted the model results based on these scenarios for various risk factors that are not considered within our modeling processes but are nonetheless relevant in assessing the expected credit losses within our loan pools these qfactor adjustments are discussed below qfactor adjustments are based upon management judgment and current assessment as to the impact of risks related to changes in lending policies and procedures economic and business conditions loan portfolio attributes and credit concentrations and external factors among other things that are not already captured within the modeling inputs assumptions and other processes management assesses the potential impact of such items within a range of severely negative impact to positive impact and adjusts the modeled expected credit loss by an aggregate adjustment percentage based upon the assessment as a result of this assessment as of march modeled expected credit losses were adjusted upwards by a weightedaverage qfactor adjustment of approximately unchanged from approximately at december the weightedaverage qfactor adjustment at march was based on a positive expected impact related to changes in lending policies procedures and underwriting standards a limited negative expected impact associated with changes in loan portfolio attributes and concentrations changes in risk grades changes in the volumes and severity of loan delinquencies and adverse classifications and potential deterioration of collateral values and a severely negative impact from other risk factors ta ble of contents associated with our commercial real estate construction and land loan portfolios particularly the risks related to expected extensions in the first quarter of unprecedented economic conditions due to the covid19 pandemic and oil and gas price volatility resulted in significant spikes in the unemployment rate and the level of unemployment claims as well as severe declines in the level of the us and texas gdps among other things in some cases our expected credit loss models consider these economic variables on a three to fourquarter lag basis as of march the significant spikes in several of these variables are no longer impacting our model results however as the economy has entered recovery the models are now being impacted by exceptionally positive changes in certain variables which has resulted in lower estimates of expected credit losses notwithstanding the foregoing management believes there are still significant headwinds impacting the recovery of the us and texas economies and certain categories of our loan portfolio as a result we have provided additional qualitative adjustments for certain categories of loans as further described below as of march we provided an additional qualitative adjustment for our energy production loan portfolio this adjustment was estimated based on borrowing base determinations for our energy production loans using current engineering valuations and a projected oil price deck of for and increasing to for we also perform an analysis of our customers secondary sources of capital through this process at march we estimated an aggregate borrowing base deficiency on energy production loans totaling approximately million management believes that the aggregate borrowing base deficiency amount should serve as the appropriate level of expected credit losses for energy production loans accordingly this resulted in an additional qualitative adjustment of approximately million for energy production loans at march using a similar methodology as described in our from 10k we provided an additional qualitative adjustment for energy production loans of approximately million at december we performed a separate assessment of other nonproduction energy loans which are primarily made up of borrowers associated with oilfield services such as transportation and logistics equipment manufacturing and other services among other things this assessment included a review of customer liquidity and cash flows as well as various debt ratios through this review we were able to identify a small pool of borrowers that management considered to have an elevated level of risk as a result of this elevated level of risk management provided an additional qualitative adjustment for other nonproduction energy loans of approximately million at march no additional qualitative adjustment for nonproduction energy loans was made as of december our commercial real estate oversight council in its oversight and assessment of the credit quality of our commercial real estate loan portfolios believes these portfolios continue to have an elevated level of risk notwithstanding recent economic stimulus efforts by federal and state governments as of march we provided additional qualitative adjustments totaling million for various categories of our commercial real estate loan portfolio this amount includes million for nonowneroccupied commercial real estate loans million for owneroccupied commercial real estate loans and million for commercial real estate construction loans these additional qualitative adjustments are largely related to the ongoing effects of the covid19 pandemic as further discussed below and to a lesser extent to compensate for the effect of the exceptionally positive changes in certain economic variables used by our credit loss models which has resulted in significantly lower estimates of expected credit losses beyond a level that management deems appropriate given the significant headwinds management believes are still impacting the recovery of the us and texas economies and certain categories of our loan portfolio the covid19 pandemic has resulted in a significant decrease in commercial activity throughout the state of texas as well as nationally efforts to limit the spread of covid19 led to the closure of nonessential businesses travel restrictions supply chain disruptions and prohibitions on public gatherings among other things throughout many parts of the united states and in particular the markets in which we operate nonetheless by late the markets in which we operate had substantially reopened aside from the energy industry which is discussed above we lend to customers operating in certain other industries detailed in the table below that have been and are expected to continue to be more significantly impacted by the effects of the covid19 pandemic we are continuing to monitor customers in these industries closely in assessing these portfolios for an additional qualitative adjustment we performed a comprehensive review of the financial condition and overall outlook of the borrowers within these portfolios based on this analysis we determined that there continues to be an elevated level of risk associated with these industries as a result we provided an additional qualitative adjustment related to the effects of the covid19 pandemic totaling million as of march of which million was allocated to commercial real estate loans and included in the totals detailed above as of
