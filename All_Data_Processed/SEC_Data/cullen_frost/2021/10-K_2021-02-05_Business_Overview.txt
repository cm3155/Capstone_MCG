or controlling banks and other activities that the federal reserve board has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto in addition bank holding companies that qualify and elect to be financial holding companies may engage in any activity or acquire and retain the shares of a company engaged in any activity that is either i financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity as determined by the federal reserve board in consultation with the secretary of the treasury or ii complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally as solely determined by the federal reserve board without prior approval of the federal reserve board activities that are financial in nature include securities underwriting and dealing insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments to maintain financial holding company status a financial holding company and all of its depository institution subsidiaries must be well capitalized and well managed a depository institution subsidiary is considered to be well capitalized if it satisfies the requirements for this status discussed in the section captioned capital adequacy and prompt corrective action elsewhere in this item a depository institution subsidiary is considered well managed if it received a composite rating and management rating of at least satisfactory in its most recent examination a financial holding companys status will also depend upon it maintaining its status as well capitalized and well managed under applicable federal reserve board regulations if a financial holding company ceases to meet these capital and management requirements the federal reserve boards regulations provide that the financial holding company must enter into an agreement with the federal reserve board to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements until the financial holding company returns to compliance the federal reserve board may impose limitations or conditions on the conduct of its activities and the company may not commence any of the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or acquire a company engaged in such financial activities without prior approval of the federal reserve board if the company does not return to compliance within days the federal reserve board may require divestiture of the holding companys depository institutions bank holding companies and banks must also be both well capitalized and well managed in order to acquire banks located outside their home state in order for a financial holding company to commence any new activity permitted by the bhc act or to acquire a

most recent examination under the community reinvestment act see the section captioned community reinvestment act elsewhere in this item the federal reserve board has the power to order any bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when the federal reserve board has reasonable grounds to believe that continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness safety or stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company the bhc act the bank merger act the texas banking code and other federal and state statutes regulate acquisitions of commercial banks and their parent holding companies the bhc act requires the prior approval of the federal reserve board for the direct or indirect acquisition by a bank holding company of more than of the voting shares of a commercial bank or its parent holding company under the bank merger act the prior approval of the federal reserve board or other appropriate bank regulatory authority is required for a member bank to merge with another bank or purchase substantially all of the assets or assume any deposits of another bank in reviewing applications seeking approval of merger and acquisition transactions the bank regulatory authorities will consider among other things the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions the applicants managerial and financial resources the capital position of the combined organization the risks to the stability of the us banking or financial system eg systemic risk the applicants performance record under the community reinvestment act see the section captioned community reinvestment act elsewhere in this item and its compliance with law including fair housing and other consumer protection laws and the effectiveness of the subject organizations in combating money laundering activities dividends and stock repurchases the principal source of cullenfrosts liquidity is dividends from frost bank the prior approval of the federal reserve board is required if the total of all dividends declared by a statechartered member bank in any calendar year would exceed the sum of the banks net profits for that year and its retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years less any required transfers to surplus or to fund the retirement of preferred stock federal law also prohibits a statechartered member bank from paying dividends that would be greater than the banks undivided profits frost bank is also subject to limitations under texas state law regarding the level of dividends that may be paid under the foregoing dividend restrictions and while maintaining its well capitalized status frost bank could pay aggregate dividends of approximately million to cullenfrost without obtaining affirmative governmental approvals at december this amount is not necessarily indicative of amounts that may be paid or available to be paid in future periods in addition cullenfrost and frost bank are subject to other regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends including requirements to maintain adequate capital above regulatory minimums the appropriate federal regulatory authority is authorized to determine under certain circumstances relating to the financial condition of a bank holding company or a bank that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof additionally it is federal reserve policy that bank holding companies generally should pay dividends on common stock only out of net income available to common shareholders over the past year and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organizations current and expected future capital needs asset quality and overall financial condition federal reserve policy also provides that a bank holding company should inform the federal reserve reasonably in advance of declaring or paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period for which the dividend is being paid or that could result in a material adverse change to the bank holding companys capital structure in july the federal bank regulators adopted final rules the capital simplifications rules that among other things eliminated the standalone prior approval requirement in the basel iii capital rules for any repurchase of common stock in certain circumstances cullenfrosts repurchases of its common stock may be subject to a prior approval or notice requirement under other regulations policies or supervisory expectations of the federal reserve board any redemption or repurchase of preferred stock or subordinated debt remains subject to the prior approval of the federal reserve board transactions with affiliates transactions between frost bank and its subsidiaries on the one hand and cullenfrost or any other subsidiary on the other hand are regulated under federal banking law the federal reserve act imposes quantitative and qualitative requirements and collateral requirements on covered transactions by frost bank with or for the benefit of its affiliates and generally requires those transactions to be on terms at least as favorable to frost bank as if the transaction were conducted with an unaffiliated third party covered transactions are defined by statute to include a loan or extension of credit as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate a purchase of assets unless otherwise exempted by the federal reserve board from the affiliate certain derivative transactions that create a credit exposure to an affiliate the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan and the issuance of a guarantee acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate in general any such transaction by frost bank or its subsidiaries must be limited to certain thresholds on an individual and aggregate basis and for credit transactions with any affiliate must be secured by designated amounts of specified collateral federal law also limits a banks authority to extend credit to its directors executive officers and stockholders as well as to entities controlled by such persons among other things extensions of credit to insiders are required to be made on terms that are substantially the same as and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons also the terms of such extensions of credit may not involve more than the normal risk of nonrepayment or present other unfavorable features and may not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons individually and in the aggregate source of strength doctrine federal reserve board policy and federal law require bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks under this requirement cullenfrost is expected to commit resources to support frost bank including at times when cullenfrost may not be in a financial position to provide such resources any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks in the event of a bank holding companys bankruptcy any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment capital requirements cullenfrost and frost bank are each required to comply with applicable capital adequacy standards adopted by the federal reserve board the basel iii capital rules since fully phased in on january the basel iii capital rules require cullenfrost and frost bank to maintain the following a minimum ratio of common equity tier cet1 to riskweighted assets of at least plus a capital conservation buffer that is composed entirely of cet1 capital resulting in a minimum ratio of cet1 to riskweighted assets of a minimum ratio of tier capital to riskweighted assets of at least plus the capital conservation buffer resulting in a minimum tier capital ratio of a minimum ratio of total capital tier capital plus tier capital to riskweighted assets of at least plus the capital conservation buffer resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of and a minimum leverage ratio of calculated as the ratio of tier capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements known as the leverage ratio banking institutions that fail to meet the effective minimum ratios once the capital conservation buffer is taken into account as detailed above will be subject to constraints on capital distributions including dividends and share repurchases and certain discretionary executive compensation the severity of the constraints depends on the amount of the shortfall and the institutions eligible retained income that is the greater of i net income for the preceding four quarters net of distributions and associated tax effects not reflected in net income and ii average net income over the preceding four quarters the basel iii capital rules and the capital simplification rules also provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to cet1 these include for example the requirement that certain deferred tax assets and significant investments in nonconsolidated financial entities be deducted from cet1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds of cet1 prior to the adoption of the capital simplification rules in july amounts were deducted from cet1 to the extent that any one such category exceeded of cet1 or all such items in the aggregate exceeded of cet1 the capital simplification rules took effect for cullenfrost and frost bank as of january these limitations did not impact our regulatory capital during any of the reported periods in addition under the general riskbased capital rules the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income items included in capital were excluded for the purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios under the basel iii capital rules the effects of certain accumulated other comprehensive income items are not excluded however nonadvanced approaches banking organizations including cullenfrost and frost bank were able to make a onetime permanent election to continue to exclude these items both cullenfrost and frost bank made this election in order to avoid significant variations in the level of capital depending upon the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the fair value of their availableforsale securities portfolio under the basel iii capital rules trust preferred securities no longer included in our tier capital may nonetheless be included as a component of tier capital on a permanent basis without phaseout in february the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule the cecl rule that revised certain capital regulations to account for changes to credit loss accounting under us gaap the cecl rule included a transition option that allows banking organizations to phase in over a threeyear period the dayone adverse effects of adopting a new accounting standard related to the measurement of current expected credit losses cecl on their regulatory capital ratios threeyear transition option in march the federal bank regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule that maintains the threeyear transition option of the cecl rule and also provides banking organizations that were required under us gaap as of january to implement cecl before the end of the option to delay for two years an estimate of the effect of cecl on regulatory capital relative to the incurred loss methodologys effect on regulatory capital followed by a threeyear transition period fiveyear transition option we elected to adopt the fiveyear transition option accordingly a cecl transitional amount totaling million has been added back to cet1 as of december the cecl transitional amount includes million related to the cumulative effect of adopting cecl and million related to the estimated incremental effect of cecl since adoption the basel iii capital rules prescribe a standardized approach for risk weightings that expanded the riskweighting categories from the general riskbased capital rules to a much larger and more risksensitive number of categories depending on the nature of the assets generally ranging from for us government and agency securities to for certain equity exposures and higher percentages for certain other types of interests and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories in november the federal banking agencies adopted a rule revising the scope of commercial real estate mortgages subject to a risk weight in december the basel committee published standards that it described as the finalization of the basel iii postcrisis regulatory reforms the standards are commonly referred to as basel iv among other things these standards revise the basel committees standardized approach for credit risk including by recalibrating risk weights and introducing new capital requirements for certain unconditionally cancellable commitments such as unused credit card lines of credit and provides a new standardized approach for operational risk capital under the basel framework these standards will generally be effective on january with an aggregate output floor phasing in through january under the current us capital rules operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to advanced approaches institutions and not to cullenfrost or frost bank the impact of basel iv on us will depend on the manner in which it is implemented by the federal bank regulators liquidity requirements the basel iii liquidity framework and regulations of the federal reserve require that certain banks and bank holding companies measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests one test referred to as the liquidity coverage ratio lcr is designed to ensure that the banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered highquality liquid assets equal to the entitys expected net cash outflow for a 30day time horizon or if greater of its expected total cash outflow under an acute liquidity stress scenario the other test referred to as the net stable funding ratio nsfr is designed to promote more medium and longterm funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a oneyear time horizon rules applicable to certain large banking organizations have been implemented for lcr and for nsfr however based on our asset size these rules do not currently apply to cullenfrost and frost bank prompt corrective action the federal deposit insurance act as amended fdia requires among other things the federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements the fdia includes the following five capital tiers well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized a bank will be i well capitalized if the institution has a total riskbased capital ratio of or greater a cet1 capital ratio of or greater a tier riskbased capital ratio of or greater and a leverage ratio of or greater and is not subject to any order or written directive by any such regulatory authority to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure ii adequately capitalized if the institution has a total riskbased capital ratio of or greater a cet1 capital ratio of or greater a tier riskbased capital ratio of or greater and a leverage ratio of or greater and is not well capitalized iii undercapitalized if the institution has a total riskbased capital ratio that is less than a cet1 capital ratio less than a tier riskbased capital ratio of less than or a leverage ratio of less than iv significantly undercapitalized if the institution has a total riskbased capital ratio of less than a cet1 capital ratio less than a tier riskbased capital ratio of less than or a leverage ratio of less than and v critically undercapitalized if the institutions tangible equity is equal to or less than of average quarterly tangible assets an institution may be downgraded to or deemed to be in a capital category that is lower than indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters a banks capital category is determined solely for the purpose of applying prompt corrective action regulations and the capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of the banks overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes in addition the fdia prohibits an insured depository institution from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in the banks normal market area or nationally depending upon where the deposits are solicited unless it is well capitalized or is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the fdic a depository institution that is adequately capitalized and accepts brokered deposits under a waiver from the fdic may not pay an interest rate on any deposit in excess of basis points over certain prevailing market rates in december the fdic finalized a rule that is intended to bring the brokered deposits regulations in line with modern deposit taking methods and that may reduce the amount of deposits that would be classified as brokered the fdia generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distributions including payment of a dividend or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized undercapitalized institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan the agencies may not accept such a plan without determining among other things that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institutions capital in addition for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable the depository institutions parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan the bank holding company must also provide appropriate assurances of performance the aggregate liability of the parent holding company is limited to the lesser of i an amount equal to of the depository institutions total assets at the time it became undercapitalized and ii the amount which is necessary or would have been necessary to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan if a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator the appropriate federal banking agency may under certain circumstances reclassify a well capitalized insured depository institution as adequately capitalized the fdia provides that an institution may be reclassified if the appropriate federal banking agency determines after notice and opportunity for hearing that the institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition or deems the institution to be engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice the appropriate agency is also permitted to require an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution to comply with the supervisory provisions as if the institution were in the next lower category but not treat a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized based on supervisory information other than the capital levels of the institution cullenfrost believes that as of december its bank subsidiary frost bank was well capitalized based on the aforementioned ratios for further information regarding the capital ratios and leverage ratio of cullenfrost and frost bank see the discussion under the section captioned capital and liquidity included in item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note capital and regulatory matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data elsewhere in this report safety and soundness standards the fdia requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to prescribe standards by regulations or guidelines relating to internal controls information systems and internal audit systems loan documentation credit underwriting interest rate risk exposure asset growth asset quality earnings stock valuation and compensation fees and benefits and such other operational and managerial standards as the agencies deem appropriate guidelines adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems internal audit systems loan documentation credit underwriting interest rate exposure asset growth and compensation fees and benefits in general the guidelines require among other things appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risk and exposures specified in the guidelines the guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer employee director or principal stockholder in addition the agencies adopted regulations that authorize but do not require an agency to order an institution that has been given notice by an agency that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan if after being so notified an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject under the prompt corrective action provisions of the fdia see prompt corrective action above if an institution fails to comply with such an order the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties deposit insurance deposits at frost bank are insured up to applicable limits by the deposit insurance fund dif of the fdic and frost bank is subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the dif deposit insurance assessments are based on average total assets minus average tangible equity for larger institutions such as frost bank the fdic uses a performance score and a lossseverity score that are used to calculate an initial assessment rate in calculating these scores the fdic uses a banks capital level and supervisory ratings and certain financial measures to assess an institutions ability to withstand assetrelated stress and fundingrelated stress the fdic has the ability to make discretionary adjustments to the total score based upon significant risk factors that are not adequately captured in the calculations under the fdia the fdic may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law regulation rule order or condition imposed by the fdic in addition the fdic is authorized to conduct examinations of and require reporting by fdicinsured institutions enhanced prudential standards the federal reserve board is required to monitor emerging risks to financial stability and enact enhanced supervision and prudential standards applicable to large bank holding companies and certain nonbank covered companies designated as systemically important by the financial stability oversight council the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act mandates that certain regulatory requirements applicable to these systemically important financial institutions be more stringent than those applicable to other financial institutions in the federal reserve board adopted new rules impacting certain capital and liquidity requirements and other enhanced prudential standards the final rules assign all domestic bank holding companies with billion or more in total consolidated assets to one of four categories of tailored regulatory requirements cullenfrost and frost bank are generally not impacted by these rules the enhanced prudential standards rules as amended in require publicly traded bank holding companies with billion or more in total consolidated assets to establish risk committees prior to the amendment the requirement to establish a risk committee was applicable to publicly traded bank holding companies with billion or more in consolidated assets cullenfrost has established and currently maintains a risk committee the volcker rule the socalled volcker rule under the doddfrank act restricts banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring hedge funds and private equity funds the volcker rule does not significantly impact the operations of cullenfrost and its subsidiaries as we do not have any engagement in the businesses prohibited by the volcker rule depositor preference the fdia provides that in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution the claims of depositors of the institution including the claims of the fdic as subrogee of insured depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as a receiver will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution if an insured depository institution fails insured and uninsured depositors along with the fdic will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured nondeposit creditors including depositors whose deposits are payable only outside of the united states and the parent bank holding company with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution interchange fees under the durbin amendment to the doddfrank act the federal reserve adopted rules establishing standards for assessing whether the interchange fees that may be charged with respect to certain electronic debit transactions are reasonable and proportional to the costs incurred by issuers for processing such transactions interchange fees or swipe fees are charges that merchants pay to us and other cardissuing banks for processing electronic payment transactions federal reserve board rules applicable to financial institutions that have assets of billion or more provide that the maximum permissible interchange fee for an electronic debit transaction is the sum of  per transaction and basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction an upward adjustment of no more than cent to an issuers

corporation fdic and the office of the comptroller of the currency occ jointly proposed rules that would significantly change existing cra regulations the proposed rules are intended to increase bank activity in low and moderateincome communities where there is significant need for credit more responsible lending greater access to banking services and improvements to critical infrastructure the proposals change four key areas i clarifying what activities qualify for cra credit ii updating where activities count for cra credit iii providing a more transparent and objective method for

public comment on an approach to modernize the regulations that implement the cra by strengthening clarifying and tailoring them to reflect the current banking landscape and better meet the core purpose of the cra the anpr seeks feedback on ways to evaluate how banks meet the needs of low and moderateincome communities and address inequities in credit access as such we will continue to evaluate the impact of any changes to the regulations implementing the cra and their impact to our financial condition results of operations andor liquidity which cannot be predicted at this time financial privacy the federal banking regulators adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties these limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and in some circumstances allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party these regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors antimoney laundering and the usa patriot act a major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions in recent years has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing the usa patriot act of or the usa patriot act substantially broadened the scope of united states antimoney laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the united states financial institutions are also prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must use enhanced due diligence procedures in their dealings with certain types of highrisk customers and implement a written customer identification program financial institutions must take certain steps to assist government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering and report certain types of suspicious transactions regulatory authorities routinely examine financial institutions for compliance with these obligations and failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations could have serious financial legal and reputational consequences for the institution including causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required regulatory authorities have imposed cease and desist orders and civil money penalties against institutions found to be violating these obligations the antimoney laundering act of amla which amends the bank secrecy act of bsa was enacted in january the amla is intended to be a

transactions even if approval is not required regulatory authorities have imposed cease and desist orders and civil money penalties against institutions found to be violating these obligations incentive compensation the federal reserve board reviews as part of its regular riskfocused examination process the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations such as cullenfrost that are not large complex banking organizations these reviews are tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organizations activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements deficiencies will be incorporated into the organizations supervisory ratings which can affect the organizations ability to make acquisitions and take other actions enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related riskmanagement control or governance processes pose a risk to the organizations safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies in june the federal reserve board occ and fdic issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risktaking the guidance which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization either individually or as part of a group is based upon the key principles that a banking organizations incentive compensation arrangements should i provide incentives that do not encourage risktaking beyond the organizations ability to effectively identify and manage risks ii be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management and iii be supported by strong corporate governance including active and effective oversight by the organizations board of directors in the us financial regulators including the federal reserve board and the sec proposed revised rules on incentivebased payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least billion in total assets including cullenfrost and frost bank but these propose rules have not been finalized cybersecurity in march federal regulators issued two related statements regarding cybersecurity one statement indicates that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing internetbased services of the financial institution the other statement indicates that a financial institutions management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery resumption and maintenance of the institutions operations after a cyberattack involving destructive malware a financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyberattack if we fail to observe the regulatory guidance we could be subject to various regulatory sanctions including financial penalties in october the federal banking regulators jointly issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on enhanced cyber risk management standards that are intended to increase the operational resilience of large and interconnected entities under their supervision if established the enhanced cyber risk management standards would be designed to help reduce the potential impact of a cyberattack or other cyberrelated failure on the financial system the advance notice of proposed rulemaking addresses five categories of cyber standards i cyber risk governance ii cyber risk management iii internal dependency management iv external dependency management and v incident response cyber resilience and situational awareness in may the federal reserve announced that it would revisit the advance notice of proposed rulemaking in the future in december the federal banking agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would require banking organizations to notify their primary regulator within hours of becoming aware of a computersecurity incident or a notification incident the notice of proposed rulemaking also would require specific and immediate notifications by bank service providers that become aware of similar incidents in february the sec published interpretive guidance to assist public companies in preparing disclosures about cybersecurity risks and incidents these sec guidelines and any other regulatory guidance are in addition to notification and disclosure requirements under state and federal banking law and regulations state regulators have also been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations recently several states have adopted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and providing detailed requirements with respect to these programs including data encryption requirements many states including texas have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification and data privacy requirements we expect this trend of statelevel activity in those areas to continue and are continually monitoring developments in the states in which our customers are located in the ordinary course of business we rely on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our operations and to store sensitive data we employ an indepth layered defensive approach that leverages people processes and technology to manage and maintain cybersecurity controls we employ a variety of preventative and detective tools to monitor block and provide alerts regarding suspicious activity as well as to report on any suspected advanced persistent threats notwithstanding the strength of our defensive measures the threat from cyber attacks is severe attacks are sophisticated and increasing in volume and attackers respond rapidly to changes in defensive measures while to date other than as described below we have not detected a material compromise material data loss or any material financial losses related to cybersecurity attacks our systems and those of our customers and thirdparty service providers are under constant threat and attack and it is possible that we could experience significant events in the future risks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats as well as due to the expanding use of internet banking mobile banking and other technologybased products and services by us and our customers see item risk factors for a further discussion of risks related to cybersecurity during we experienced a data security incident that resulted in unauthorized access to a thirdparty lockbox software program used by certain of our commercial lockbox customers to store digital images we stopped the identified unauthorized access and consulted with a leading cybersecurity firm we reported the incident to and cooperated with lawenforcement authorities we contacted each of the affected commercial customers and we supported them in taking appropriate actions the identified incident did not impact other frost systems outofpocket costs incurred related to this incident totaled million and no further costs are expected with respect to this incident future legislation and regulation congress may enact legislation from time to time that affects the regulation of the financial services industry and state legislatures may enact legislation from time to time affecting the regulation of financial institutions chartered by or operating in those states federal and state regulatory agencies also periodically propose and adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied the substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulation or the application thereof cannot be predicted although any change could impact the regulatory structure under which we or our competitors operate and may significantly increase costs impede the efficiency of internal business processes require an increase in regulatory capital require modifications to our business strategy and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner it could also affect our competitors differently than us including in a manner that would make them more competitive a change in statutes regulations or regulatory policies applicable to cullenfrost or any of its subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations human capital
