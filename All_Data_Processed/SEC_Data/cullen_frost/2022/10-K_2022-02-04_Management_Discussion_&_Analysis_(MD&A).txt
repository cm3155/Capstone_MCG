forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date on which such statements are made we do not undertake any obligation to update any forwardlooking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events covid19 effects actions and recent developments overview during and to a lesser extent in our business has been and continues to be impacted by the ongoing outbreak of covid19 in march covid19 was declared a pandemic by the world health organization and a national emergency by the president of the united states efforts to limit the spread of covid19 have included quarantinesshelterinplace orders the closure or limiting capacity of businesses travel restrictions supply chain limitations and prohibitions on public gatherings among other things throughout many parts of the united states and in particular the markets in which we operate as the current pandemic is ongoing and dynamic in nature there are many uncertainties related to covid19 including among other things its severity the duration of the outbreak the impact to our customers employees and vendors the impact to the financial services and banking industry and the impact to the economy as a whole as well as the effect of actions taken or that may yet be taken or inaction by governmental authorities to contain the outbreak or to mitigate its impact both economic and healthrelated covid19 has negatively affected and is expected to continue to negatively affect our business financial position and operating results in light of the uncertainties and continuing developments discussed herein the ultimate adverse impact of covid19 cannot be reliably estimated at this time but it has been and is expected to continue to be material the longerterm potential impact on our business could depend to a large extent on future developments and actions taken by authorities and other entities to contain covid19 and its economic impact furthermore the sustainability of the economic recovery observed in remains unclear and significant volatility could continue for a prolonged period as the potential exists for additional variants of covid19 including the recent omicron variant to impede the global economic recovery and exacerbate geographic differences in the spread of and response to covid19 impact on our operations in the state of texas and many other jurisdictions declared health emergencies the resulting closures andor limited operations of nonessential businesses and related economic disruption impacted our operations as well as the operations of our customers financial services were identified as a critical infrastructure sector by the department of homeland security accordingly our business remained open and we implemented our business continuity and health emergency response plans to address the issues arising as a result of covid19 and to facilitate the continued delivery of essential services while maintaining a high level of safety for our customers as well as our employees nonetheless as the covid19 pandemic continues to be ongoing there continues to be uncertainties related to its magnitude duration and persistent effects this is particularly the case with the emergence contagiousness and threat of new and different strains of the virus as well as the availability acceptance and effectiveness of vaccines as such the covid19 pandemic could still among other things greatly affect our routine and essential operations due to staff absenteeism particularly among key personnel result in limited access to or closures of our branch facilities and other physical offices exacerbate operational technical or securityrelated risks arising from a remote workforce and result in adverse government or regulatory agency orders additionally we are experiencing an increasingly competitive labor market due to an ongoing labor shortage which has impacted and could continue to impact our ability to staff open positions andor retain existing employees and has resulted in and could continue to result in an increase in our staffing costs the business and operations of our thirdparty service providers many of whom perform critical services for our business could also be significantly impacted by many of these same issues which in turn could impact us as a result we continue to be unable to fully assess or predict the extent of the effects of covid19 on our operations as the ultimate impact will depend on factors that are currently unknown andor beyond our control impact on our financial position and results of operations our financial position and results of operations are particularly susceptible to the ability of our loan customers to meet loan obligations the availability of our workforce the availability of our vendors and the decline in the value of assets held by us while its effects continue to be ongoing during and to a lesser extent in the covid19 pandemic resulted in a significant decrease in commercial activity throughout the state of texas as well as nationally this decrease in commercial activity caused and in light of new and different strains of the virus may yet further cause our customers including affected businesses and individuals vendors and counterparties to be unable to meet existing payment or other obligations to us the national public health crisis arising from the covid19 pandemic and public expectations about it combined with other factors including but not limited to inflation labor shortages supply chain disruption and further oil price volatility could despite improvements in again destabilize the financial markets and geographies in which we operate the resulting economic pressure on consumers and uncertainty regarding the sustainability of any economic improvements could further impact the creditworthiness of potential and current borrowers borrower loan defaults that adversely affect our earnings correlate with deteriorating economic conditions which in turn are likely to impact our borrowers creditworthiness and our ability to make loans see further information related to the risk exposure of our loan portfolio under the sections captioned loans and allowance for credit losses elsewhere in this discussion in addition the economic pressures and uncertainties arising from the covid19 pandemic have resulted in and may continue to result in specific changes in consumer and business spending and borrowing and saving habits affecting the demand for loans and other products and services we offer consumers affected by covid19 may continue to demonstrate changed behavior even after the crisis is over for example consumers may decrease discretionary spending on a permanent or longterm basis and certain industries may take longer to recover particularly those that rely on travel or large gatherings as consumers may be hesitant to return to full social interaction we lend to customers operating in such industries including energy hotelslodging restaurants entertainment and commercial real estate among others that have been significantly impacted by covid19 and we are continuing to monitor these customers closely additionally the temporary closures of bank branches in and the safety precautions implemented at reopened branches could result in consumers becoming more comfortable with technology and devaluing facetoface interaction our business is relationship driven and such changes could necessitate changes to our business practices to accommodate changing consumer behaviors legislative and regulatory actions actions taken by the federal government and the federal reserve and other bank regulatory agencies to mitigate the economic effects of covid19 have impacted our financial position and results of operations these actions are further discussed below during in an effort to provide monetary stimulus to counteract the economic disruption caused by covid19 the federal reserve expanded reverse repo operations adding liquidity to the banking system restarted quantitative easing lowered the interest rate at the discount window by to reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero percent encouraged banks to use their capital and liquidity buffers to lend introduced and expanded several new temporary programs to help preserve market liquidity in the us government enacted certain fiscal stimulus measures in several phases to counteract the economic disruption caused by the covid19 the phase legislation the coronavirus preparedness and response supplemental appropriations act was enacted on march and among other things authorized funding for research and development of vaccines and allocated money to state and local governments to aid containment and response measures the phase legislation the families first coronavirus response act was enacted on march and provided

other things the ppphe act provided an additional billion of funding for the ppp the paycheck protection program flexibility act of the pppf act was enacted in june to modify certain provisions of the ppp including among other things establishing a minimum maturity of five years for all loans made after the enactment of the pppf act and permitted an extension of the maturity of existing loans to five years if the borrower and lender agree in december the bipartisanbicameral omnibus covid relief deal included as a component of appropriations legislation was enacted to provide economic stimulus to individuals and businesses in further response to the economic distress caused by the covid19 pandemic among other things the legislation i authorized payments of for individuals making up to per

enacted extending the bankruptcy relief provisions enacted in the cares act of bill until march these provisions provide financially distressed small businesses and individuals greater access to bankruptcy relief we are continuing to monitor the potential development of additional legislation and further actions taken by the us government the above mentioned significant fiscal stimulus and monetary policy actions of the us government and federal reserve have been contributing factors to an inflationary surge during most of as a result in december the federal reserve released projections related to the target range for the federal funds rate that imply while there can be no such assurance that any increases in the federal funds rate will occur three basis point increases in the federal funds rate in followed by three in and two in as further discussed in the section captioned net interest income elsewhere in this discussion banks and bank holding companies have been particularly impacted by the covid19 pandemic as a result of disruption and volatility in the global capital markets we are closely monitoring the potential for new laws and regulations impacting lending and funding practices as well as capital and liquidity standards such changes could require us to maintain significantly more capital with common equity as a more predominant component or manage the composition of our assets and liabilities to comply with formulaic liquidity requirements application of critical accounting policies and accounting estimates we follow accounting and reporting policies that conform in all material respects to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and to general practices within the financial services industry the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes while we base estimates on historical experience current information and other factors deemed to be relevant actual results could differ from those estimates we consider accounting estimates to be critical to reported financial results if i the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and ii different estimates that management reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period could have a material impact on our financial statements accounting policies related to the allowance for credit losses on financial instruments including loans and offbalancesheet credit exposures are considered to be critical as these policies involve considerable subjective judgment and estimation by management as discussed in note summary of significant accounting policies our policies related to allowances for credit losses changed on january in connection with the adoption of a new accounting standard update as codified in accounting standards codification asc topic asc financial instruments credit losses in the case of loans the allowance for credit losses is a contraasset valuation account calculated in accordance with asc that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected in the case of offbalancesheet credit exposures the allowance for credit losses is a liability account calculated in accordance with asc reported as a component of accrued interest payable and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets the amount of each allowance account represents managements best estimate of current expected credit losses on these financial instruments considering available information from internal and external sources relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the instrument relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts while historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses adjustments to historical loss information may be made for differences in current portfoliospecific risk characteristics environmental conditions or other relevant factors while management utilizes its best judgment and information available the ultimate adequacy of our allowance accounts is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control including the performance of our portfolios the economy changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward classification of assets see the section captioned allowance for credit losses elsewhere in this discussion as well as note summary of significant accounting policies and note loans in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data elsewhere in this report for further details of the risk factors considered by management in estimating the necessary level of the allowance for credit losses overview the following discussion and analysis presents the more significant factors that affected our financial condition as of december and and results of operations for each of the years then ended refer to managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in our annual report on form 10k filed with the sec on february the form 10k for a discussion and analysis of the more significant factors that affected periods prior to certain reclassifications have been made to make prior periods comparable this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements notes thereto and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report from time to time we have acquired various small businesses through our insurance subsidiary none of these acquisitions had a significant impact on our financial statements we account for acquisitions using the acquisition method and as such the results of operations of acquired companies are included from the date of acquisition taxableequivalent adjustments are the result of increasing income from taxfree loans and investments by an amount equal to the taxes that would be paid if the income were fully taxable thus making taxexempt yields comparable to taxable asset yields taxable equivalent adjustments were based upon a income tax rate dollar amounts in tables are stated in thousands except for per share amounts results of operations net income available to common shareholders totaled million or diluted per common share in compared to million or diluted per common share in and million or diluted per common share in selected income statement data returns on average assets and average equity

income available to common shareholders increased million for compared to the increase was primarily the result of a million decrease in credit loss expense and an million increase in net interest income partly offset by a million decrease in noninterest income a million increase in noninterest expense and a million increase in income tax expense credit loss expense during was impacted by both our adoption of a new credit loss accounting standard and the adverse events impacting our loan portfolio including those arising from the covid19 pandemic and the significant volatility in oil prices noninterest income during was impacted by a million net gain on securities transactions during the first quarter net income available to common shareholders during was also impacted by the reclassification of million of issuance costs associated with our series a preferred stock to retained earnings upon redemption of the series a preferred stock details of the changes in the various components of net income are further discussed below net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense on liabilities such as deposits and borrowings which are used to fund those assets net interest income is our largest source of revenue representing of total revenue during net interest margin is the ratio of taxableequivalent net interest income to average earning assets for the period the level of interest rates and the volume and mix of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities impact net interest income and net interest margin the federal reserve influences the general market rates of interest including the deposit and loan rates offered by many financial institutions our loan portfolio is significantly affected by changes in the prime interest rate the prime rate began at and decreased basis points during the third quarter of basis points in each of august and september and basis points in october to end the year at during the prime rate decreased basis points in march to where it remained through december our loan portfolio is also significantly impacted by changes in the london interbank offered rate libor at december the onemonth and threemonth us dollar libor rates were and respectively while at december the onemonth and threemonth us dollar libor rates were and respectively and at december the onemonth and threemonth us dollar libor rates were and respectively we discontinued originating liborbased loans effective december and will negotiate loans using our preferred replacement index the american interbank offered rate ameribor a benchmark developed by the american financial exchange the secured overnight financing rate sofr or bsby a benchmark developed by bloomberg index services for our currently outstanding liborbased loans the timing and manner in which each customers contract transitions to ameribor sofr or bsby will vary on a casebycase basis we expect to complete all transitions by the first quarter of the target range for the federal funds rate which is the cost of immediately available overnight funds began at to and decreased basis points during the third quarter of basis points in each of august and september and basis points in october to end the year at to during the target range for the federal funds rate decreased basis points in march to zero to where it remained through december the decrease in the target range for the federal funds rate in march was largely an emergency measure by the federal reserve aimed at blunting the economic impact of covid19 in december the federal reserve released projections whereby the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate would rise to by the end of to by the end of and to by the end of while there can be no such assurance that any increases in the federal funds rate will occur these projections imply three basis point increases in the federal funds rate in followed by three in and two in we are primarily funded by core deposits with noninterestbearing demand deposits historically being a significant source of funds this lowercost funding base is expected to have a positive impact on our net interest income and net interest margin in a rising interest rate environment see item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk elsewhere in this report for information about our sensitivity to interest rates further analysis of the components of our net interest margin is presented below the following table presents an analysis of net interest income and net interest spread for the periods indicated including average outstanding balances for each major category of interestearning assets

taxableequivalent net interest income during excluding the impact of the additional day results in an effective increase in taxableequivalent net interest income of approximately million during the taxableequivalent net interest margin decreased basis points from during to during the increase in taxableequivalent net interest income during was primarily related to decreases in the average costs of interestbearing deposit liabilities and other borrowed funds combined with increases in the average volumes of interestbearing deposits primarily amounts held by us in an interestbearing account at the federal reserve and taxable securities and an increase in the average taxableequivalent yield on loans the positive impact of these items was partly offset by decreases in the average volumes of loans and taxexempt securities and increases in the average volumes of interestbearing deposit liabilities and repurchase agreements combined with decreases in the average yields on taxable and taxexempt securities and interestbearing deposits primarily amounts held by us in an interestbearing account at the federal reserve the decrease in taxableequivalent net interest margin during was

forgiven by the sba during compared to loans made up approximately of average interestearning assets during compared to during in april we began originating loans to qualified small businesses under the ppp administered by the sba under the provisions of the cares act in we funded billion of ppp loans of which approximately billion were funded during the second quarter of as of december approximately billion of these originated ppp loans have been forgiven by the sba or repaid by the customer during we funded an additional billion of ppp loans most of which was during the first

related deferred processing fees net of amortization of related deferred origination costs as a yield adjustment and this amount is included in interest income on loans as a result of the inclusion of these net fees in interest income the average yields on ppp loans were and during and respectively compared to the stated interest rate of on these loans the increase in the average yield on ppp loans was impacted by a decrease in the average expected lives of the ppp loans funded in compared to furthermore the average fee percentage for originations was higher due to a smaller average loan size relative to in return for processing and booking a ppp loan the sba paid lenders a processing fee tiered by the size of the loan for loans of not more than thousand for loans of more than thousand and less than million and for loans of at least million for ppp loans funded through december we expect to recognize additional ppp loan related deferred processing fees net of deferred origination costs totaling approximately million as a yield adjustment over the remaining expected lives of these loans we expect to recognize all of this amount in the average taxableequivalent yield on securities was

decreases in the interest rates we pay on most of our interestbearing deposit products as a result of the aforementioned decreases in market interest rates in april we borrowed an aggregate billion from the federal home loan bank fhlb to provide additional liquidity in light of economic uncertainty and our significant ppp lending volume these advances were subsequently paidoff in may as we determined additional liquidity resources were not necessary our taxableequivalent net interest spread which represents the difference between the average rate earned on earning assets and the average rate paid on interestbearing liabilities was in compared to in the net interest spread as well as the net interest margin will be impacted by future changes in shortterm and longterm interest rate levels as well as the impact from the competitive environment a discussion of the effects of changing interest rates on net interest income is set forth in item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk elsewhere in this report our hedging policies permit the use of various derivative financial instruments including interest rate swaps swaptions caps and floors to manage exposure to changes in interest rates details of our derivatives and hedging activities are set forth in note derivative financial instruments in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report information regarding the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on our derivative financial instruments is set forth in item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk elsewhere in this report credit loss expense credit loss expense is determined by management as the amount to be added to the allowance for credit loss accounts for various types of financial instruments including loans securities and offbalancesheet credit exposure after net chargeoffs have been deducted to bring the allowance to a level which in managements best estimate is necessary to absorb expected credit losses over the lives of the respective financial instruments the components of credit loss expense were as follows table start credit loss expense related to loans offbalancesheet credit exposures securities held to maturity total table end credit loss expense in was calculated under the prior incurred loss accounting methodology furthermore credit loss expense related to offbalancesheet credit exposures was reported as a component of other noninterest expense prior to such amounts have been reclassified to credit loss expense to make prior periods comparable to the current presentation see the section captioned allowance for credit losses elsewhere in this discussion for further analysis of credit loss expense related to loans and offbalancesheet credit exposures noninterest income total noninterest income for decreased million or compared to excluding thousand and million in net gains on securities transactions during and respectively total noninterest income increased million or during changes in the various components of noninterest income are discussed in more detail below trust and investment management fees trust and investment management fee income for increased million or compared to investment management fees are the most significant component of trust and investment management fees making up approximately and of total trust and investment management fees in and respectively the increase in trust and investment management fees during was primarily due to increases in investment management fees up million or oil and gas fees up million estate fees up million and custody fees up thousand investment management fees and other custodial account fees are generally based on the market value of assets within an account and are thus impacted by volatility in the equity and bond markets the increases in investment management fees and custody fees during were primarily related to higher average equity valuations as well as increases in the number of accounts oil and gas fees during were impacted by increases in oil and gas prices the increase in estate fees was primarily related to an increase in the aggregate value of estates settled at december trust assets including both managed assets and custody assets were primarily composed of equity securities of trust assets fixed income securities of trust assets alternative investments of assets and cash equivalents of trust assets the estimated fair value of trust assets was billion including managed assets of billion and custody assets of billion at december compared to billion including managed assets of billion and custody assets of billion at december service charges on deposit accounts service charges on deposit accounts for increased million or compared to the increase was primarily related to an increase in commercial service charges up million partly offset by a decrease in overdraft charges on consumer accounts down million commercial service charges during were impacted by an increase in the volume of billable services relative to overdraftinsufficient funds charges totaled million million consumer and million commercial during compared to million million consumer and million commercial during the decreases in consumer overdraftinsufficient funds charges during was primarily related to a decrease in the volume of fee assessed overdrafts relative to furthermore in april we implemented a new overdraft grace feature for certain consumer demand deposit accounts whereby no fees will be assessed on overdrafts of or less subject to certain qualifying conditions such as a minimum direct deposit this new feature reduced overdraft charges on consumer accounts by approximately million during the impact on future quarters will depend on future overdraft volumes insurance commissions and fees insurance commissions and fees for increased million or compared to the increase was related to increases in contingent income up thousand and commission income up thousand contingent income totaled million in and million in contingent income primarily consists of amounts received from various property and casualty insurance carriers related to the loss performance of insurance policies previously placed these performance related contingent payments are seasonal in nature and are mostly received during the first quarter of each year this performance related contingent income totaled million in and million in the increase in performance related contingent income during was related to growth within the portfolio combined with improvement in the loss performance of insurance policies previously placed during the first quarter of a severe weather event in texas resulted in a

during the second quarter of we began originating loans to qualified small businesses under the ppp administered by the sba under the provisions of the cares act excluding ppp loans total loans would have otherwise increased million or from december the majority of our loan portfolio is comprised of commercial and industrial loans energy loans and real estate loans commercial and industrial loans made up and and excluding ppp loans of total loans at december and while energy loans made up and and excluding ppp loans of total loans at both december and and real estate loans made up and and excluding ppp loans of total loans at december and energy loans include commercial and industrial loans leases and real estate loans to borrowers in the energy industry real estate loans include both commercial and consumer balances it is possible that the ongoing effects of covid19 could continue to impact demand for our loan products loan originationrisk management we have certain lending policies and procedures in place that are designed to maximize loan income within an acceptable level of risk management reviews and approves these policies and procedures on a regular basis a reporting system supplements the review process by providing management with frequent reports related to loan production loan quality concentrations of credit loan delinquencies and nonperforming and potential problem loans diversification in the loan portfolio is a means of managing risk associated with fluctuations in economic conditions we have begun to explore the credit and reputational risks associated with climate change and their potential impact on the foregoing and are also closely monitoring regulatory developments on climate risk this includes among other things researching and developing a formalized approach to considering climate change related risks in our underwriting processes this approach will be impacted in part by the accessibility and reliability of both customer climate risk data and climate risk data in general one of the objectives of these efforts is to enable us to better understand the climate change related risks associated with our customers business activities and to be able to monitor their response to those risks and their ultimate impact on our customers commercial and industrial loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding the borrowers ability to operate profitably and prudently expand its business underwriting standards are designed to promote relationship banking rather than transactional banking once it is determined that the borrowers management possesses sound ethics and solid business acumen our management examines current and projected cash flows to determine the ability of the borrower to repay their obligations as agreed commercial and industrial loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower the cash flows of borrowers however may not be as expected and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value most commercial and industrial loans are secured by the assets being financed or other business assets such as accounts receivable or inventory and may incorporate a personal guarantee however some shortterm loans may be made on an unsecured basis in the case of loans secured by accounts receivable the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers our energy loan portfolio includes loans for production energy services and other energy loans which includes private clients transportation and equipment providers manufacturers refiners and traders the origination process for energy loans is similar to that of commercial and industrial loans because however of the average loan size the significance of the portfolio and the specialized nature of the energy industry our energy lending requires a highly prescriptive underwriting policy production loans are secured by proven developed and producing reserves loan proceeds for these types of loans are typically used for the development and drilling of additional wells the acquisition of additional production andor the acquisition of additional properties to be developed and drilled our customers in this sector are generally large independent private ownerproducers or large corporate producers these borrowers typically have large capital requirements for drilling and acquisitions and as such loans in this portfolio are generally greater than million production loans are collateralized by the oil and gas interests of the borrower collateral values are determined by the riskadjusted and limited discounted future net revenue of the reserves our valuations take into consideration geographic and reservoir differentials as well as cost structures associated with each borrower collateral value is calculated at least semiannually using thirdparty engineerprepared reserve studies these reserve studies are conducted using a discount factor and base case assumptions for the current and future value of oil and gas to qualify as collateral typically reserves must be proven developed and producing for certain borrowers collateral may include up to proven nonproducing reserves loan commitments are limited to of estimated reserve value cash flows must be sufficient to amortize the loan commitment within of the halflife of the underlying reserves loan commitments generally must also be covered by the riskadjusted and limited discounted future net revenue of the reserves when stressed at of our base case price assumptions in addition the ratio of the borrowers debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda should generally not exceed we generally require production borrowers to maintain an active hedging program to manage risk and to have at least of their production hedged for two years oil and gas service transportation and equipment providers are economically aligned due to their reliance on drilling and active oil and gas development income for these borrowers is highly dependent on the level of drilling activity and rig utilization both of which are driven by the current and future outlook for the price of oil and gas we mitigate the credit risk in this sector through conservative concentration limits and guidelines on the profile of eligible borrowers guidelines require that the companies have extensive experience through several industry cycles and that they be supported by financially competent and committed guarantors who provide a significant secondary source of repayment borrowers in this sector are typically privatelyowned middlemarket companies with annual sales of less than million the services provided by companies in this sector are highly diversified and include downhole testing and maintenance providing and threading drilling pipe hydraulic fracturing services or equipment seismic testing and equipment and other direct or indirect providers to the oil and gas production sector our private client portfolio primarily consists of loans to wealthy individuals and their related oil and gas exploration and production entities where the oil and gas producing reserves are not considered to be the primary source of repayment these borrowers and guarantors typically have significant sources of wealth including significant liquid assets andor cash flow from other investments which can fully repay the loans the credit structures of these loans are generally similar to those of energy production loans described above with respect to the valuation of the reserves taken as collateral and the repayment structures although no balances were outstanding at december and in prior years we have had a small portfolio of loans to refiners where our credit involvement with these customers was through purchases of shared national credit syndications these borrowers refine crude oil into gasoline diesel jet fuel asphalt and other petrochemicals and are not dependent on drilling or development all of the borrowers in this portfolio are very large public companies that are important employers in several of our major markets these borrowers for the most part have been longterm customers and we have a strong relationship with these companies and their executive management there is no new customer origination process for this segment and any outstanding balances are expected to only reflect the needs of these existing relationships we also have a small portfolio of loans to energy trading companies that serve as intermediaries that buy and sell oil gas other petrochemicals and ethanol these companies are not dependent on drilling or development as a general policy we do not lend to energy traders however we have made an exception to this policy for certain customers based upon their underlying business models which minimize risk as commodities are bought only to fill existing orders backtoback trading as such the commodity price risk and sale risk are eliminated ppp loans which we began originating in april are loans to qualified small businesses under the ppp administered by the sba under the provisions of the cares act loans covered by the ppp may be eligible for loan forgiveness for certain costs incurred related to payroll group health care benefit costs and qualifying mortgage rent and utility payments the remaining loan balance after forgiveness of any amounts is still fully guaranteed by the sba terms of the ppp loans include the following i maximum amount limited to the lesser of million or an amount calculated using a payrollbased formula ii maximum loan term of five years iii interest rate of iv no collateral or personal guarantees are required v no payments are required until the date on which the forgiveness amount relating to the loan is remitted to the lender and vi loan forgiveness up to the full principal amount of the loan and any accrued interest subject to certain requirements including that no more than of the loan forgiveness amount may be attributable to nonpayroll costs in return for processing and booking a ppp loan the sba paid lenders a processing fee tiered by the size of the loan for loans of not more than thousand for loans of more than thousand and less than million and for loans of at least million commercial real estate loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial and industrial loans in addition to those of real estate loans these loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate commercial real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts and the repayment of these loans is generally largely dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loan or the business conducted on the property securing the loan commercial real estate loans may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy the properties securing our commercial real estate portfolio are diverse in terms of type and geographic location this diversity helps reduce our exposure to adverse economic events that affect any single market or industry management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on collateral geography and risk grade criteria as a general rule we avoid financing singlepurpose projects unless other underwriting factors are present to help mitigate risk we also utilize thirdparty experts to provide insight and guidance about economic conditions and trends affecting market areas we serve in addition management tracks the level of owneroccupied commercial real estate loans versus nonowner occupied loans at december approximately of the outstanding principal balance of our commercial real estate loans were secured by owneroccupied properties with respect to loans to developers and builders that are secured by nonowner occupied properties that we may originate from time to time we generally require the borrower to have had an existing relationship with us and have a proven record of success construction loans are underwritten utilizing feasibility studies independent appraisal reviews sensitivity analysis of absorption and lease rates and financial analysis of the developers and property owners construction loans are generally based upon estimates of costs and value associated with the completed project these estimates may be inaccurate construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment substantially dependent on the success of the ultimate project sources of repayment for these types of loans may be precommitted permanent loans from approved longterm lenders sales of developed property or an interim loan commitment from us until permanent financing is obtained these loans are closely monitored by onsite inspections and are considered to have higher risks than other real estate loans due to their ultimate repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes governmental regulation of real property general economic conditions and the availability of longterm financing we originate consumer loans utilizing a credit scoring analysis to supplement the underwriting process to monitor and manage consumer loan risk policies and procedures are developed and modified as needed jointly by line and staff personnel this activity coupled with relatively small loan amounts that are spread across many individual borrowers minimizes risk additionally trend and outlook reports are reviewed by management on a regular basis underwriting standards for home equity loans are heavily influenced by statutory requirements which include but are not limited to loantovalue limitations collection remedies the number of such loans a borrower can have at one time and documentation requirements we maintain an independent loan review department that reviews and validates the credit risk program on a periodic basis results of these reviews are presented to management and the appropriate committees of our board of directors the loan review process complements and reinforces the risk identification and assessment decisions made by lenders and credit personnel as well as our policies and procedures commercial and industrial commercial and industrial loans increased million or during compared to our commercial and industrial loans are a diverse group of loans to small medium and large businesses the purpose of these loans varies from supporting seasonal working capital needs to term financing of equipment while some shortterm loans may be made on an unsecured basis most are secured by the assets being financed with collateral margins that are consistent with our loan policy guidelines the commercial and industrial loan portfolio also includes the commercial lease and purchased shared national credits energy energy loans include loans to entities and individuals that are engaged in various energyrelated activities including i the development and production of oil or natural gas ii providing oil and gas field servicing iii providing energyrelated transportation services iv providing equipment to support oil and gas drilling v refining petrochemicals or vi trading oil gas and related commodities energy loans decreased million or during compared to the average loan size the significance of the portfolio and the specialized nature of the energy industry requires a highly prescriptive underwriting policy exceptions to this policy are rarely granted due to the large borrowing requirements of this customer base the energy loan portfolio includes participations and purchased shared national credits paycheck protection program ppp loans include loans to businesses and other entities that would otherwise be reported as commercial and industrial loans and to a lesser extent energy loans originated under the guidelines discussed above we funded approximately billion and billion of sbaapproved ppp loans during and respectively during and we recognized approximately million and million in ppp loan related deferred processing fees net of amortization of related deferred origination costs respectively as yield adjustments and these amounts are included in interest income on loans as a result of the inclusion of these net fees in interest income the average yields on ppp loans were during and during compared to the stated interest rate of on these loans we expect to recognize additional ppp loan related deferred processing fees net of deferred origination costs totaling approximately million as a yield adjustment during industry concentrations as of december and there were no concentrations of loans related to any

table end large credit relationships the market areas served by us include three of the top ten most populated cities in the united states these market areas are also home to a significant number of fortune companies as a result we originate and maintain large credit relationships with numerous commercial customers in the ordinary course of business we consider large credit relationships to be those with commitments equal to or in excess of million excluding treasury management lines exposure prior to any portion being sold large relationships also include loan participations purchased if the credit relationship with the agent is equal to or in excess of million in addition to our normal policies and procedures related to the origination of large credits one of our regional credit

contractual obligation on our part we will renewextend maturing lines of credit or refinance existing loans at their maturity dates some loans may renew multiple times in a given year as a result of general customer practice and need these renewals extensions and refinancings are made in the ordinary course of business for customers that meet our normal level of credit standards such borrowers typically request renewals to support their ongoing working capital needs to finance their operations such borrowers are not experiencing financial difficulties and generally could obtain similar financing from another financial institution in connection with each renewal extension or refinancing we may require a principal reduction adjust the rate of interest andor modify the structure and other terms to reflect the current market pricingstructuring for such loans or to maintain competitiveness with other financial institutions in such cases we do not generally grant concessions and

in note loans in the accompanying consolidated financial statements we measure expected credit losses over the life of each loan utilizing a combination of models which measure probability of default and loss given default among other things the measurement of expected credit losses is impacted by loanborrower attributes and certain macroeconomic variables models are adjusted to reflect the current impact of certain macroeconomic variables as well as their expected changes over a reasonable and supportable forecast period in estimating expected credit losses as of december we utilized the moodys analytics december consensus scenario the december consensus scenario to forecast the macroeconomic variables used in our models the december consensus scenario was based on the review of a

models utilized the economic forecasts in the moodys consensus scenario for december for our estimated expected credit losses as of december and the moodys baseline scenario for december for our estimate of expected credit losses as of december we qualitatively adjusted the model results based on these scenarios for various risk factors that are not considered within our modeling processes but are nonetheless relevant in assessing the expected credit losses within our loan pools these qfactor and other qualitative adjustments are discussed below qfactor adjustments are based upon management judgment and current assessment as to the impact of risks related to changes in lending policies and procedures economic and business conditions loan portfolio attributes and credit concentrations and external factors among other things that are not already captured within the modeling inputs assumptions and other processes management assesses the potential impact of such items within a range of severely negative impact to positive impact and adjusts the modeled expected credit loss by an aggregate adjustment percentage based upon the assessment as a result of this assessment as of december modeled expected credit losses were adjusted upwards by a weightedaverage qfactor adjustment of approximately up from approximately at december the weightedaverage qfactor adjustment at december was based on a limited negative expected impact on our commercial loan portfolios related to changes in lending policies procedures and underwriting standards and changes in loan portfolio concentrations a negative expected impact associated with national regional and local economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of loans a severely negative expected impact from other risk factors associated with our commercial real estate construction and land loan portfolios particularly the risks related to expected extensions and no impact to changes in loan portfolio attributes changes in risk grades changes in the volumes and severity of loan delinquencies and adverse classifications and potential deterioration of collateral values the weightedaverage qfactor adjustment at december was based on a positive expected impact related to changes in lending policies procedures and underwriting standards a limited negative expected impact associated with changes in loan portfolio attributes and concentrations changes in risk grades changes in the volumes and severity of loan delinquencies and adverse classifications and potential deterioration of collateral values and a severely negative expected impact from other risk factors associated with our commercial real estate construction and land loan portfolios particularly the risks related to expected extensions in the first quarter of unprecedented economic conditions due to the covid19 pandemic and oil and gas price volatility resulted in significant spikes in the unemployment rate and the level of unemployment claims as well as severe declines in the level of the us and texas gdps among other things in some cases our expected credit loss models consider these economic variables on a three to fourquarter lag basis as of december the table of conten t s significant spikes in several of these variables are no longer impacting our model results however as the economy has entered recovery the models are now being impacted by exceptionally positive changes in certain variables which has resulted in lower estimates of expected credit losses notwithstanding the foregoing management believes there are still significant headwinds impacting the recovery of the us and texas economies and certain categories of our loan portfolio as a result we have provided additional qualitative adjustments for certain categories of loans as further described below as of december we provided an additional qualitative adjustment for energy production loans this adjustment was estimated based on borrowing base determinations for our energy production loans using current engineering valuations we also performed an analysis of our customers secondary sources of capital as a result of the estimated borrowing base deficiencies for the identified credits we provided an additional qualitative adjustment of approximately million for energy production loans at december using a similar methodology we determined that a similar qualitative adjustment was not necessary as of december as there were no longer any significant borrowing base deficiencies within the energy production portfolio as a result of higher market prices for oil and gas and lower line balances on production loans nonetheless as of december we provided an additional qualitative adjustment for energy loans totaling million to address the risk associated with relationship exposure concentrations within the energy loan portfolio as further discussed below our commercial real estate oversight council in its oversight and assessment of the credit quality of our commercial real estate loan portfolios believes these portfolios continue to have an elevated level of risk notwithstanding recent economic stimulus efforts by federal and state governments as of december we provided additional qualitative adjustments totaling million for various categories of our commercial real estate loan portfolio this amount includes million for nonowneroccupied commercial real estate loans million for owneroccupied commercial real estate loans and million for commercial real estate construction loans these additional qualitative adjustments are largely related to the ongoing effects of the covid19 pandemic as further discussed below and to compensate for the effect of unusually large positive changes in certain economic variables used by our credit loss models the covid19 pandemic has also been a catalyst for the evolution of various remote work options which could impact the longterm performance of some types of office properties within our commercial real estate portfolio furthermore management believes that there are still significant headwinds impacting the recovery of the us and texas economies and certain categories of our loan portfolio these additional qualitative adjustments also include million to address the risk associated with relationship exposure concentrations within our commercial real estate loan portfolio as further discussed below the covid19 pandemic has resulted in a significant decrease in commercial activity throughout the state of texas as well as nationally efforts to limit the spread of covid19 led to the closure of nonessential businesses travel restrictions supply chain disruptions and prohibitions on public gatherings among other things throughout many parts of the united states and in particular the markets in which we operate nonetheless by late the markets in which we operate had substantially reopened we lend to customers operating in certain industries detailed in the table below that have been and are expected to continue to be more significantly impacted by the effects of the covid19 pandemic we are continuing to monitor customers in these industries closely in assessing these portfolios for an additional qualitative adjustment we performed a comprehensive review of the financial condition and overall outlook of the borrowers within these portfolios based on this analysis we determined that there continues to be an elevated level of risk associated with these industries as a result we provided an additional qualitative adjustment related to the effects of the covid19 pandemic totaling million as of december of which million was allocated to commercial real estate loans and million was allocated to commercial and industrial loans these amounts are included in the totals detailed above as of december we provided a similar additional qualitative adjustment totaling million which for the most part was allocated to commercial real estate loans table of conten t s these industries that management believes are particularly impacted by the effects of the covid19 pandemic are presented in the following table as of december and and include amounts reported as both commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans while ppp loans are excluded table start outstanding balance percentage of total loans excluding ppp loans allocated allowance allocated allowance as a percentage of outstanding balance december hotelslodging restaurants entertainment total december retailstrip centers hotelslodging restaurants entertainment total table end as of december we provided an additional qualitative adjustment for our commercial and industrial loan portfolio totaling million of which million was included in the million additional qualitative adjustment for covid19 impacted industries discussed above the adjustment also included million to address the risk associated with relationship exposure concentrations within our commercial and industrial loan portfolio as further discussed below lastly the adjustment included million to address the risk associated with the longterm sustainability of borrowers within our small business commercial and industrial loan portfolio the majority of these borrowers have been bolstered by ppp funding from the sba which has helped them to sustain their operations amid ongoing pandemicrelated shutdowns and other restrictions nonetheless management believes there is an elevated level of risk associated with the longterm viability of many of these businesses when this government supplemented funding runs out furthermore on march the covid19 bankruptcy relief extension act of was enacted extending the bankruptcy relief provisions enacted in the cares act of until march these provisions provide financially distressed small businesses and individuals greater access to bankruptcy relief in that regard we also provided an additional qualitative adjustment for our consumer and other loan portfolio totaling million in light of the level of unsecured loans within this portfolio and other risk factors as of december we allocated million to address the risk associated with relationship exposure concentrations within our loan portfolio of this amount million was allocated to energy loans million was allocated to commercial and industrial loans and million was allocated to commercial real estate loans management has observed through industry research that the degree to which expected credit losses fluctuate is directly related to the degree to which a loan portfolio is concentrated or diversified a highly concentrated loan portfolio is more likely to exhibit concentrated losses compared to a well diversified loan portfolio where segments are exposed to relatively uncorrelated factors the variations in loan portfolio concentrations over time cause expected credit losses within our existing portfolio to differ from historical loss experience given that the allowance for credit losses on loans reflects expected credit losses within our loan portfolio and the fact that these expected credit losses are uncertain as to nature timing and amount management believes that segments with higher concentration risk are more likely to experience a high loss event due to the fact that a significant portion of our loan portfolio is concentrated in large credit relationships and because of large concentrated credit losses in recent years management made the aforementioned qualitative adjustments which were based upon statistical analysis to address the risk associated with the such a relationship deteriorating to a loss event table of conten t s

our prior incurred loss methodology and primarily reflected the level of net chargeoffs and specific valuation allowances as well as the impact of the overall growth in the loan portfolio since previous yearend the ratio of the allowance for credit losses on loans to total loans was excluding ppp loans at december compared to excluding ppp loans at december and at december management believes the recorded amount of the allowance for credit losses on loans is appropriate based upon managements best estimate of current expected credit losses within the existing portfolio of loans should any of the factors considered by management in making this estimate change our estimate of current expect credit losses could also change which could affect the level of future credit loss expense related to loans table of conten t s allowance for credit losses offbalancesheet credit exposures the allowance for credit losses on offbalancesheet credit exposures totaled million and

due the liquidity of a financial institution reflects its ability to meet loan requests to accommodate possible outflows in deposits and to take advantage of interest rate market opportunities the ability of a financial institution to meet its current financial obligations is a function of its balance sheet structure its ability to liquidate assets and its access to alternative sources of funds the objective of our liquidity management is to manage cash flow and liquidity reserves so that they are adequate to fund our operations and to meet obligations and other commitments on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost we seek to achieve this objective and ensure that funding needs are met by maintaining an appropriate level of liquid funds through assetliability management which includes managing the mix and time to maturity of financial assets and financial liabilities on our balance sheet our liquidity position is enhanced by our ability to raise additional funds as needed in the wholesale markets table of conten t s asset liquidity is provided by liquid assets which are readily marketable or pledgeable or which will mature in the near future liquid assets include cash interestbearing deposits in banks securities available for sale maturities and cash flow from securities held to maturity and federal funds sold and resell agreements liability liquidity is provided by access to funding sources which include core deposits and correspondent banks in our natural trade area that maintain accounts with and sell federal funds to frost bank as well as federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements from upstream banks and deposits obtained through financial intermediaries our liquidity position is continuously monitored and adjustments are made to the balance between sources and uses of funds as deemed appropriate liquidity risk management is an important element in our assetliability management process we regularly model liquidity stress scenarios to assess potential liquidity outflows or funding problems resulting from economic disruptions volatility in the financial markets unexpected credit events or other significant occurrences deemed problematic by management these scenarios are incorporated into our contingency funding plan which provides the basis for the identification of our liquidity needs as of december we had approximately
