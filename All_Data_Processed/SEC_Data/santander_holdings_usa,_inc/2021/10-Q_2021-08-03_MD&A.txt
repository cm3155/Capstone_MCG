of loans for which no fico score was available or legacy portfolios for which fico is not considered in the alll model while underwriting guidelines are designed to establish that the customer would be a reasonable credit risk nonprime loans will nonetheless experience higher default rates than a portfolio of obligations of prime customers additionally higher unemployment rates higher gasoline prices unstable real estate values resets of adjustable rate mortgages to higher interest rates the general availability of consumer credit and other factors that impact consumer confidence or disposable income could lead to an increase in delinquencies defaults and repossessions as well as decreased consumer demand for used automobiles and other consumer products weaken collateral values and increase losses in the event of default because scs historical focus for such credit has been predominantly on nonprime consumers the actual rates of delinquencies defaults repossessions and

on the loans tdrs occur when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and the loan is modified with terms that would otherwise not be granted to the borrower the types of concessions granted are generally interest rate reductions limitations on accrued interest charged term extensions and deferments of principal tdrs are generally placed on nonaccrual status upon modification unless the loan was performing immediately prior to modification for most portfolios tdrs may return to accrual status after a sustained period of repayment performance as long as the company believes the principal and interest of the restructured loan will be paid in full ric tdrs are placed on nonaccrual status when the company believes repayment under the revised terms is not reasonably assured and at the latest when the account becomes more than dpd ric tdrs are considered for return to accrual when the account becomes days or less past due to the extent the tdr is determined to be

includes drawdowns on lines of credit that have previously been classified as tdrs in accordance with the companys policies and guidelines the company may offer extensions deferrals to consumers on its rics whereby the consumer is allowed to move a maximum of three payments per event to the end of the loan the companys policies and guidelines limit the frequency of each new deferral to one deferral every six months regardless of the length of any prior deferral further the maximum number of lifetime months extended for all automobile rics is eight while some marine and rv contracts have a maximum of twelve months extended to reflect their longer term additionally the company generally limits the granting of deferrals on new accounts until a requisite number of months have passed since origination during the deferral period the company continues to accrue and collect interest on the loan in accordance with the terms of the deferral agreement in march the company began actively working with its borrowers impacted by covid19 and provided loan modification programs in accordance with the cares act and interagency guidelines to mitigate the adverse effects of covid19 on modifications these programs temporarily revised the practices noted above during and increased the volume of modifications provided to our customers effective january at sc and april at sbna the company has generally returned to prepandemic servicing practices with the exception of an increased limit on the total months of extensions allowed as of june the overall modification volumes were consistent with volumes experienced before the covid19 pandemic and the number and dollar amount of active covid19 modifications was immaterial the company evaluates the results of its deferral strategies based upon the amount of cash installments that are collected on accounts after they have been deferred compared to the extent to which the collateral underlying the deferred accounts has depreciated over the same period of time based on this evaluation the company believes that payment deferrals granted according to its policies and guidelines are an effective portfolio management technique and result in higher ultimate cash collections from the portfolio changes in deferral levels do not have a direct impact on the ultimate amount of consumer finance receivables chargedoff however the timing of a chargeoff may be affected if the previously deferred account ultimately results in a chargeoff to the extent deferrals impact the ultimate timing of when an account is chargedoff historical chargeoff ratios loss confirmation periods and cash flow forecasts used in the determination of the adequacy of the alll for loans classified as tdrs are also impacted increased use of deferrals may result in a lengthening of the loss confirmation period which would increase expectations of credit losses inherent in the portfolio and therefore increase the alll and related credit loss expense changes in these ratios and periods are considered in determining the appropriate level of the alll and related credit loss expense for loans that are classified as tdrs the company generally compares the present value of expected cash flows to the outstanding recorded investment of tdrs to determine the amount of allowance and related credit loss expense that should be recorded for loans that are considered collateraldependent such as certain bankruptcy modifications impairment is measured based on the fair value of the collateral less its estimated costs to sell credit risk the risk inherent in the companys loan and lease portfolios is driven by credit and collateral quality and is affected by borrowerspecific and economywide facts such as changes in unemployment gdp hpi cre price index used vehicle index growth rates and other factors in general there is an inverse relationship between credit quality of transactions and projections of impairment losses so that transactions with better credit quality require a lower expected loss the company manages this risk through its underwriting pricing and credit approval guidelines and servicing

note to the condensed consolidated financial statements asset and liability management interest rate risk interest rate risk arises primarily through the companys traditional business activities of extending loans and accepting deposits many factors including economic and financial conditions movements in market interest rates and consumer preferences affect the spread between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities interest rate risk is managed by the companys treasury group and measured by its market risk department with oversight by the assetliability committee in managing interest rate risk the company seeks to minimize the variability of net interest income across various likely scenarios while at the same time maximizing net interest income and the net interest margin to achieve these objectives the treasury group works closely with each business line in the company the treasury group also uses various other tools to manage interest rate risk including wholesale funding maturity targeting investment portfolio purchase strategies asset securitizationssales and financial derivatives interest rate risk focuses on managing four elements of risk associated with interest rates basis risk repricing risk yield curve risk and option risk basis risk stems from rate index timing differences with rate changes such as differences in the extent of changes in federal funds rates compared with the threemonth libor repricing risk stems from the different timing of contractual repricing such as onemonth versus threemonth reset dates as well as the related maturities yield curve risk stems from the impact on earnings and market value resulting from different shapes and levels of yield curves option risk stems from prepayment or early withdrawal risk embedded in various products these four elements of risk are analyzed through a combination of net interest income and balance sheet valuation simulations shocks to those simulations and scenario and market value analyses and the subsequent results are reviewed by management numerous assumptions are made to produce these analyses including assumptions about new business volumes loan and investment prepayment rates deposit flows interest rate curves economic conditions and competitor pricing item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations net interest income simulation analysis the company utilizes a variety of measurement techniques to evaluate the impact of interest rate risk including simulating the impact of changing interest rates on expected future interest income and interest expense to estimate the companys net interest income sensitivity this simulation is run monthly and includes various scenarios that help management understand the potential risks in the companys net interest income sensitivity these scenarios include both parallel and nonparallel rate shocks as well as other scenarios that are consistent with quantifying the four elements of risk described above this information is used to develop proactive strategies to ensure that the companys risk position remains within shusa board of directorsapproved limits so that future earnings are not significantly adversely affected by future interest rates the table below reflects the estimated sensitivity to the companys net interest income based on interest rate changes at june and december the following estimated percentage increasedecrease to net interest income would result if interest rates changed in parallel by the amounts below june december down basis points up basis points up basis points mve analysis the company also evaluates the impact of interest rate risk by utilizing mve modeling this analysis measures the present value of all estimated future cash flows of the company over the estimated remaining life of the balance sheet mve is calculated as the difference between the market value of assets and liabilities the mve calculation utilizes only the current balance sheet and therefore does not factor in any future changes in balance sheet size balance sheet mix yield curve relationships or product spreads which may mitigate the impact of any interest rate changes management examines the effect of interest rate changes on mve the sensitivity of mve to changes in interest rates is a measure of longerterm interest rate risk and highlights the potential capital at risk due to adverse changes in market interest rates the following table discloses the estimated sensitivity to the companys mve at june and december the following estimated percentage increasedecrease to mve would result if interest rates changed in parallel by the amounts below june december down basis points up basis points up basis points as of june the companys profile reflected a decrease of mve of for downward parallel interest rate shocks of basis points and a decrease of for upward parallel interest rate shocks of basis points the asymmetrical sensitivity between up and down shock is due to the negative convexity as a result of the prepayment option embedded in mortgagerelated products the impact of which is not fully offset by the behavior of the funding base largely nmds in downward parallel interest rate shocks mortgagerelated products prepayments increase their duration decreases and their market value appreciation is therefore limited at the same time with deposit rates remaining at comparatively low levels the company cannot effectively transfer interest rate declines to its nmd customers for upward parallel interest rate shocks extension risk weighs on a sizable portion of the companys mortgagerelated products which are predominantly longterm and fixedrate and for larger shocks the loss in market value is not offset by the change in nmds limitations of interest rate risk analyses since the assumptions used are inherently uncertain the company cannot predict precisely the effect of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income or mve actual results will differ from simulated results due to the timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes the difference between actual experience and the assumed volume characteristics of new business behavior of existing positions and changes in market conditions and management strategies among other factors item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations uses of derivatives to manage interest rate and other risks to mitigate interest rate risk and to a lesser extent foreign exchange equity and credit risks the company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the effects that changes in interest rates may have on net income the fair value of assets and liabilities and cash flows through the companys capital markets and mortgage banking activities it is subject to price risk the company employs various tools to measure and manage price risk in its portfolios in addition shusas board of directors has established certain limits relative to positions and activities the level of price risk exposure at any point in time depends on the market environment and expectations of future price and market movements and will vary from period to period management uses derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of interest rate movements on the fair value of certain liabilities assets and highly probable forecasted cash flows these instruments primarily include interest rate swaps that have underlying interest rates based on key benchmark indices and forward sale or purchase commitments the nature and volume of the derivative instruments used to manage interest rate risk depend on the level and type of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and the risk management strategies for the current and anticipated interest rate environments the companys derivatives portfolio includes mortgage banking interest rate lock commitments forward sale commitments and interest rate swaps as part of its overall business strategy sbna originates residential mortgages it sells a portion of this production to the fhlmc the fnma and private investors the company uses forward sales as a means of hedging against the economic impact of changes in interest rates on the mortgages that are originated for sale and on interest rate lock commitments the company typically retains the servicing rights related to residential mortgage loans that are sold the majority of the companys residential msrs are accounted for at fair value as deemed appropriate the company economically hedges msrs using interest rate swaps and forward contracts to purchase mbs for additional information on msrs see note to the condensed consolidated financial statements the company uses foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities foreign exchange contracts which include spot and forward contracts represent agreements to exchange the currency of one country for the currency of another country at an agreedupon price on an agreedupon settlement date exposure to gains and losses on these contracts increase or decrease over their respective lives as currency exchange and interest rates fluctuate the company also utilizes forward contracts to manage market risk associated with certain expected investment securities sales and equity options which manage its market risk associated with certain customer deposit products for additional
