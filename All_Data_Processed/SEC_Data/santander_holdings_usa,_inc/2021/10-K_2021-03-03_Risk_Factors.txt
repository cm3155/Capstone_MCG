item risk factors summary risk factors the company is subject to a number of risks that if realized could affect its business financial condition results of operations cash flows and access to liquidity materially as a financial services organization certain elements of risk are inherent in our businesses accordingly the company encounters risk as part of the normal course of its businesses some of the companys more significant challenges and risks include the following the covid19 pandemic continues to affect our business closures and disruptions to businesses in the us due to the covid19 pandemic have led to negative effects on our customers in some situations reducing demand for certain of our products and services and necessitating greater customer support initiatives actions by government authorities to control the spread of covid19 and provide economic relief to the public such as allowing customers to forego making scheduled loan payments or precluding creditors from exercising rights with respect to collateral may contribute to negative effects to our business financial condition and results of operations we are vulnerable to disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets disruptions and volatility in financial markets can have a material adverse effect on our ability to access capital and liquidity on acceptable financial terms negative and fluctuating economic conditions such as a changing interest rate environment may cause our lending margins to decrease and reduce customer demand for our higher margin products and services uncertainty regarding libor may affect our business adversely we have established an enterprisewide initiative to identify asses and monitor risks associated with the anticipated discontinuation of libor however there can be no assurance that we and other market participants will be adequately prepared for the potential disruption to financial markets and potential adverse effects to interest rates on our loans deposits derivatives and other financial instruments currently tied to libor we are subject to substantial regulation as a financial institution we are subject to extensive regulation by government agencies including limitations on permissible activities required financial stress tests required nonobjection to certain actions investigations and other regulatory proceedings if we are unable to meet the expectations of our regulators fully we may need to divert significant resources to remedial actions be unable to take planned capital actions andor be subject to fines or other enforcement actions among other things these circumstances could affect our revenues and expenses and other aspects of our business and operations adversely we may not be able to detect money laundering or other illegal or improper activities fully or on a timely basis we work regularly to improve our policies procedures and capabilities to detect and prevent financial crimes however such crimes are evolving continually and there will be instances in which we may be used by other parties to engage in money laundering or other illegal or improper activities these instances may result in regulatory fines sanctions andor legal enforcement which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and prospects credit risk is inherent in our business our customers and counterparties financial condition repayment abilities repayment intentions the value of their collateral and government economic policies market interest rates and other factors affect the quality of our loan portfolio many of these factors are beyond our control and there can be no assurance that our current or future loan and lease loss reserves will be sufficient to cover actual losses liquidity and funding risks are inherent in our business changes in market interest rates and our credit spreads occur continuously may be unpredictable and highly volatile and can significantly increase our cost of funding we rely primarily on deposits to fund lending activities however our ability to maintain or grow deposits depends on factors outside our control such as general economic conditions and confidence of depositors in the economy and the financial services industry if deposit withdrawals increase significantly in a short period of time it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and prospects we are subject to fluctuations in interest rates interest rates are highly sensitive to factors beyond our control such as increased regulation of the financial sector monetary policies economic and political conditions and other factors variations in interest rates could impact net interest income which comprises the majority of our revenue reducing our growth and potentially resulting in losses we are subject to significant competition we compete with banks that are larger than us and nontraditional providers of banking services who may not be subject to the same regulatory or legislative requirements to which we are subject if we are unable to compete successfully with current and new competitors and anticipate changing banking industry trends our business may be affected adversely risks relating to data collection processing storage systems and data security proper functioning of financial controls accounting and other data collection and processing systems is critical to our businesses and our ability to compete effectively inadequate personnel inadequate or failed internal control processes or systems or external events that interrupt normal business operations could each impair our data collection processing storage systems and data security and result in losses we and others in our industry face cybersecurity risks we take protective measures and monitor and develop our systems continuously to protect our technology infrastructure and data from cyberattacks however cybersecurity risks continue to increase for our industry and the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of parties behind such attacks present risks for compromised data theft of funds or theft or destruction of corporate information and assets scs financial results could impact our results scs earnings have historically been a significant source of funding for the company factors that could negatively affect scs financial results could consequently affect shusas financial results the above list is not exhaustive and we face additional challenges and risks please carefully consider all of the information in this formk including matters set forth in this risk factors section risk factors risk management and mitigation are important parts of the companys business model and integrated into the companys daytoday operations the success of the companys business is dependent on managements ability to identify understand manage and mitigate the risks presented by business activities in light of the companys strategic and financial objectives these risks include credit risk market risk capital risk liquidity risk operational risk model risk investment risk compliance and legal risk and strategic and reputational risk we discuss our principal risk management processes in the risk management section included in item of this annual report on returns we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws if the judgments estimates and assumptions we use in preparing our tax returns are subsequently found to be incorrect there could be a material effect on our results of operations changes in taxes and other assessments may adversely affect us the legislatures and tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate regularly enact reforms to the tax and other assessment regimes to which we and our customers are subject such reforms include changes in the rate of assessments and occasionally enactment of temporary taxes the proceeds of which are earmarked for designated governmental purposes the effects of these changes and any other changes that result from enactment of additional tax reforms cannot be quantified and there can be no assurance that such reforms would not have an adverse effect upon our business aspects of recent us federal income tax reform such as the tax cuts and jobs act of limit or eliminate certain income tax deductions including the home mortgage interest deduction the deduction of interest on home equity loans and a limitation on the deductibility of property taxes these limitations and eliminations could affect demand for some of our retail banking products and the valuation of assets securing certain of our loans adversely increasing our credit loss expense and reducing profitability credit risks if the level of our npls increases or our credit quality deteriorates in the future or if our loan and lease loss reserves are insufficient to cover loan and lease losses this could have a material adverse effect on us risks arising from changes in credit quality and the recoverability of loans and amounts due from counterparties are inherent in a wide range of our businesses nonperforming or low credit quality loans have in the past negatively impacted and can continue to negatively impact our results of operations in particular the amount of our reported npls may increase in the future as a result of growth in our total loan portfolio including as a result of loan portfolios we may acquire in the future or factors beyond our control such as adverse changes in the credit quality of our borrowers and counterparties or a general deterioration in economic conditions in the united states the impact of political events events affecting certain industries or events affecting financial markets there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively control the level of the npls in our loan portfolio our loan and lease loss reserves are based on our current assessment of and expectations concerning various factors affecting the quality of our loan portfolio these factors include among other things our borrowers financial condition repayment abilities and repayment intentions the realizable value of any collateral the prospects for support from any guarantor government macroeconomic policies interest rates and the legal and regulatory environment many of these factors are beyond our control as a result there is no precise method for predicting loan and credit losses and there can be no assurance that our current or future loan and lease loss reserves will be sufficient to cover actual losses if our assessment of and expectations concerning the abovementioned factors differ from actual developments if the quality of our total loan portfolio deteriorates for any reason including an increase in lending to individuals and small and medium enterprises a volume increase in our credit card portfolio or the introduction of new products or if future actual losses exceed our estimates of expected losses we may be required to increase our loan and lease loss reserves which may adversely affect us if we were unable to control or reduce the level of our nonperforming or poor credit quality loans this also could have a material adverse effect on us in addition the fasbs asu financial instruments credit losses topic measurement of credit losses on financial instruments was adopted by the company on january and increased our acl by approximately billion this standard replaces existing incurred loss impairment guidance and establishes a single allowance framework for financial assets carried at amortized cost as a result of the adoption of this standard companies must recognize credit losses on these assets equal to managements estimate of credit losses over the assets remaining expected lives it is possible that our ongoing reported earnings and lending activity will be impacted negatively as a result of the application of this asu see changes in accounting standards could impact reported earnings below our loan and investment portfolios are subject to risk of prepayment which could have a material adverse effect on us our fixedrate loan and investment portfolios are subject to prepayment risk which results from the ability of a borrower or issuer to pay a debt obligation prior to maturity generally in a low interest rate environment prepayment activity increases and this reduces the weighted average life of our earning assets and could have a material adverse effect on us we would also be required to amortize net premiums into income over a shorter period of time thereby reducing the corresponding asset yield and net interest income prepayment risk also has a significant adverse impact on credit card and collateralized mortgage loans since prepayments could shorten the weighted average life of these assets which may result in a mismatch in our funding obligations and reinvestment at lower yields prepayment risk is inherent in our commercial activity and an increase in prepayments could have a material adverse effect on us the value of the collateral securing our loans may not be sufficient and we may be unable to realize the full value of the collateral securing our loan portfolio the value of the collateral securing our loan portfolio may fluctuate or decline due to factors beyond our control including macroeconomic factors affecting the united states the value of the collateral securing our loan portfolio may be adversely affected by force majeure events such as natural disasters particularly in locations in which a significant portion of our loan portfolio is composed of real estate loans natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods may cause widespread damage which could impair the asset quality of our loan portfolio and have an adverse impact on the economy of the affected region we also may not have sufficiently recent information on the value of collateral which may result in an inaccurate assessment of impairment losses of our loans secured by such collateral if any of the above were to occur we may need to make additional provisions to cover actual impairment losses on our loans which may materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in addition auto industry technology changes accelerated by environmental rules could affect our auto consumer business particularly the residual values of leased vehicles which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and prospects we are subject to counterparty risk in our banking business we are exposed to counterparty risk in addition to credit risks associated with lending activities counterparty risk may arise from for example investing in securities of third parties entering into derivatives contracts under which counterparties have obligations to make payments to us or executing securities futures currency or commodity trades that fail to settle at the required time due to nondelivery by the counterparty or systems failure by clearing agents clearinghouses or other financial intermediaries we routinely transact with counterparties in the financial services industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual funds hedge funds and other institutional clients we rely on information provided by or on behalf of counterparties such as financial statements and we may rely on representations of our counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information defaults by and even rumors or questions about the solvency of certain financial institutions and the financial services industry generally have led to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by other institutions many routine transactions we enter into expose us to significant credit risk in the event of default by one of our significant counterparties liquidity and financing risks liquidity and funding risks are inherent in our business and could have a material adverse effect on us liquidity risk is the risk that we either do not have available sufficient financial resources to meet our obligations as they become due or can secure them only at excessive cost this risk is inherent in any retail and commercial banking business and can be heightened by a number of enterprisespecific factors including overreliance on a particular source of funding changes in credit ratings or marketwide phenomena such as market dislocation while we implement liquidity management processes to seek to mitigate and control these risks unforeseen systemic market factors in particular make it difficult to eliminate these risks completely adverse and continued constraints in the supply of liquidity including interbank lending may materially and adversely affect the cost of funding our business and extreme liquidity constraints may affect our current operations and our ability to fulfill regulatory liquidity requirements as well as limit growth possibilities our cost of obtaining funding is directly related to prevailing market interest rates and our credit spreads increases in interest rates and our credit spreads can significantly increase the cost of our funding changes in our credit spreads are marketdriven and may be influenced by market perceptions of our creditworthiness changes to interest rates and our credit spreads occur continuously and may be unpredictable and highly volatile if wholesale markets financing ceases to be available or becomes excessively expensive we may be forced to raise the rates we pay on deposits with a view to attracting more customers andor to sell assets potentially at depressed prices the persistence or worsening of these adverse market conditions or an increase in base interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our ability to access liquidity and cost of funding we rely and will continue to rely primarily on deposits to fund lending activities the ongoing availability of this type of funding is sensitive to a variety of factors outside our control such as general economic conditions and the confidence of depositors in the economy in general and the financial services industry in particular as well as competition among banks for deposits any of these factors could significantly increase the amount of deposit withdrawals in a short period of time thereby reducing our ability to access deposit funding in the future on appropriate terms or at all if these circumstances were to arise they could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and prospects we anticipate that our customers will continue to make deposits particularly demand deposits and shortterm time deposits in the near future and we intend to maintain our emphasis on the use of banking deposits as a source of funds the shortterm nature of some deposits could cause liquidity problems for us in the future if deposits are not made in the volumes we expect or are not renewed if a substantial number of our depositors withdraw their demand deposits or do not roll over their time deposits upon maturity we may be materially and adversely affected there can be no assurance that in the event of a sudden or unexpected shortage of funds in the banking system we will be able to maintain levels of funding without incurring high funding costs a reduction in the term of funding instruments or the liquidation of certain assets if this were to happen we could be materially adversely affected credit market and liquidity risk may have an adverse effect on our credit ratings and our cost of funds any downgrading in our credit rating would likely increase our cost of funding require us to post additional collateral or take other actions under some of our derivative contracts and adversely affect our interest margins and results of operations credit ratings affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding rating agencies regularly evaluate us and their ratings of our debt are based on a number of factors including our financial strength and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally any downgrade in our or santanders debt credit ratings would likely increase our borrowing costs and require us to post additional collateral or take other actions under some of our derivatives contracts and could limit our access to capital markets and adversely affect our commercial business for example a ratings downgrade could adversely affect our ability to sell or market certain of our products engage in certain longerterm and derivatives transactions and retain customers particularly customers who need a minimum rating threshold in order to invest in addition under the terms of certain of our derivatives contracts we may be required to maintain a minimum credit rating or terminate the contracts any of these results of a ratings downgrade in turn could reduce our liquidity and have an adverse effect on us including our operating results and financial condition we conduct a significant number of our material derivatives activities through santander and santander uk we estimate that as of december if all of the rating agencies were to downgrade santanders or santander uks longterm senior debt ratings we would be required to post additional collateral pursuant to derivatives and other financial contracts refer to further discussion in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements while certain potential impacts of these downgrades are contractual and quantifiable the full consequences of a credit rating downgrade are inherently uncertain as they depend on numerous dynamic complex and interrelated factors and assumptions including market conditions at the time of any downgrade whether any downgrade of a companys longterm credit rating precipitates downgrades to its shortterm credit rating and assumptions about the potential behaviors of various customers investors and counterparties actual outflows could be higher or lower than this hypothetical example depending on certain factors including which credit rating agency downgrades our credit rating any management or restructuring actions that could be taken to reduce cash outflows and the potential liquidity impact from loss of unsecured funding such as from money market funds or loss of secured funding capacity although unsecured and secured funding stresses are included in our stress testing scenarios and a portion of our total liquid assets is held against these risks it is still the case that a credit rating downgrade could have a material adverse effect on the company the bank and sc in addition if we were required to cancel our derivatives contracts with certain counterparties and were unable to replace those contracts our market risk profile could be altered there can be no assurance that the rating agencies will maintain their current ratings or outlooks in general the future evolution of our ratings will be linked to a large extent to the macroeconomic outlook and to the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our asset quality profitability and capital failure to maintain favorable ratings and outlooks could increase the cost of funding and adversely affect interest margins which could have a material adverse effect on us market risks we are subject to fluctuations in interest rates and other market risks which may materially and adversely affect us market risk refers to the probability of variations in our net interest income or in the market value of our assets and liabilities due to volatility of interest rates exchange rates or equity prices changes in interest rates affect the following areas of our business among others net interest income the volume of loans originated the market value of our securities holdings the value of our loans and deposits gains from sales of loans and securities and gains and losses from derivatives interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control including increased regulation of the financial sector monetary policies domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors variations in interest rates could affect our net interest income which comprises the majority of our revenue reducing our growth rate and potentially resulting in losses this is a result of the different effect a change in interest rates may have on the interest earned on our assets and the interest paid on our borrowings in addition we may incur costs which in turn will impact our results as we implement strategies to reduce future interest rate exposure increases in interest rates may reduce the volume of loans we originate sustained high interest rates have historically discouraged customers from borrowing and have resulted in increased delinquencies in outstanding loans and deterioration in the quality of assets increases in interest rates may also reduce the propensity of our customers to prepay or refinance fixedrate loans increases in interest rates may reduce the value of our financial assets and the collateral used to secure our loans and may reduce gains or require us to record losses on sales of our loans or securities in addition we may experience increased delinquencies in a low interest rate environment when such an environment is accompanied by high unemployment and recessionary conditions we are exposed to foreign exchange rate risk as a result of mismatches between assets and liabilities denominated in different currencies fluctuations in the exchange rate between currencies may negatively affect our earnings and value of our assets and securities some of our investment management services fees are based on financial market valuations of assets certain of our subsidiaries manage or hold in custody for clients changes in these valuations can affect noninterest income positively or negatively and ultimately affect our financial results significant changes in the volume of activity in the capital markets and in the number of assignments we are awarded could also affect our financial results we are also exposed to equity price risk in our investments in equity securities the performance of financial markets may cause changes in the value of our investment and trading portfolios the volatility of world equity markets due to economic uncertainty and sovereign debt concerns has had a particularly strong impact on the financial sector continued volatility may affect the value of our investments in equity securities and depending on their fair value and future recovery expectations could become a permanent impairment which would be subject to writeoffs against our results to the extent any of these risks materialize our net interest income and the market value of our assets and liabilities could be materially adversely affected market conditions have resulted and could result in material changes to the estimated fair values of our financial assets negative fair value adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in recent years financial markets have been subject to volatility and the resulting widening of credit spreads we have material exposures to securities and other investments that are recorded at fair value and are therefore exposed to potential negative fair value adjustments asset valuations in future periods reflecting thenprevailing market conditions may result in negative changes in the fair values of our financial assets and also may translate into increased impairments in addition the value we ultimately realize on disposal of the asset may be lower than its current fair value any of these factors could require us to record negative fair value adjustments which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition to the extent fair values are determined using financial valuation models such values may be inaccurate or subject to change as the data used by such models may not be available or may become unavailable due to changes in market conditions particularly for illiquid assets and in times of economic instability in such circumstances our valuation methodologies require us to make assumptions judgments and estimates in order to establish fair value and reliable assumptions are difficult to make and are inherently uncertain in addition valuation models are complex making them inherently imperfect predictors of actual results any resulting impairments or writedowns could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and prospects we are subject to market operational and other related risks associated with our derivatives transactions that could have a material adverse effect on us we enter into derivatives transactions for trading purposes as well as for hedging purposes we are subject to market credit and operational risks associated with these transactions including basis risk the risk of loss associated with variations in the spread between the asset yield and the funding andor hedge cost and credit or default risk the risk of insolvency or other inability of the counterparty to a particular transaction to perform its obligations thereunder including providing sufficient collateral the execution and performance of derivatives transactions depend on our ability to maintain adequate control and administration systems and to hire and retain qualified personnel moreover our ability to adequately monitor analyze and report derivatives transactions continues to depend to a great extent on our it systems these factors further increase the risks associated with these transactions and could have a material adverse effect on us in addition disputes with counterparties may arise regarding the terms or the settlement procedures of derivatives contracts including with respect to the value of underlying collateral which could cause us to incur unexpected costs including transaction operational legal and litigation costs or result in credit losses all of which may impair our ability to manage our risk exposure from these products risk management failure to successfully implement and continue to improve our risk management policies procedures and methods including our credit risk management system could materially and adversely affect us and we may be exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risks the management of risk is an integral part of our activities we seek to monitor and manage our risk exposure through a variety of separate but complementary financial credit market operational compliance and legal reporting systems although we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques such techniques and strategies may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all economic market environments or against all types of risk including risks that we fail to identify or anticipate we rely on quantitative models to measure risks and estimate certain financial values models may be used in such processes as determining the pricing of various products grading loans and extending credit measuring interest rate and other market risks predicting losses assessing capital adequacy and calculating economic and regulatory capital levels as well as estimating the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items poorly designed or implemented models present the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporating models will be adversely affected due to the inadequacy of that information also information we provide to the public or our regulators based on poorly designed or implemented models could be inaccurate or misleading some of our qualitative tools and metrics for managing risk are based on our use of observed historical market behavior we apply statistical and other tools to these observations to arrive at quantifications of our risk exposures these qualitative tools and metrics may fail to predict future risk exposures these risk exposures could for example arise from factors we did not anticipate or correctly evaluate in our statistical models this would limit our ability to manage our risks our losses therefore could be significantly greater than the historical measures indicate in addition our quantified modeling does not take all risks into account our more qualitative approach to managing those risks could prove insufficient exposing us to material unanticipated losses we could face adverse consequences as a result of decisions based on models that are poorly developed implemented or used or as a result of a modeled outcome being misunderstood or used of for purposes for which it was not designed in addition if existing or potential customers believe our risk management is inadequate they could take their business elsewhere or seek to limit transactions with us this could have a material adverse effect on our reputation operating results financial condition and prospects as a commercial bank one of the main types of risks inherent in our business is credit risk for example an important feature of our credit risk management is to employ an internal credit rating system to assess the particular risk profile of a customer since this process involves detailed analyses of the customer taking into account both quantitative and qualitative factors it is subject to human and it systems errors in exercising their judgment on the current and future credit risk of our customers our employees may not always assign an accurate credit rating which may result in our exposure to higher credit risks than indicated by our risk rating system we have been refining our credit policies and guidelines to address potential risks associated with particular industries or types of customers however we may not be able to timely detect all possible risks before they occur or due to limited tools available to us our employees may not be able to implement them effectively which may increase our credit risk failure to effectively implement consistently follow or continuously refine our credit risk management system may result in an increase in the level of npls and a higher risk exposure for us which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations business and industry risks the financial problems our customers face could adversely affect us market turmoil and economic recession could materially and adversely affect the liquidity businesses andor financial condition of our borrowers which could in turn increase our npl ratios impair our loan and other financial assets and result in decreased demand for borrowings in general in addition our customers may further decrease their risk tolerance to nondeposit investments such as stocks bonds and mutual funds significantly which would adversely affect our fee and commission income any of the conditions described above could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations increased competition and industry consolidation may adversely affect our results of operations we face substantial competition in all parts of our business from numerous banks and nonbank providers of financial services including in originating loans and attracting deposits providing customer service the quality and range of products and services technology interest rates and overall reputation and we expect competitive conditions to continue to intensify our competition comes principally from other domestic and foreign banks mortgage banking companies consumer finance companies insurance companies and other lenders and purchasers of loans there has been a trend towards consolidation in the banking industry which has created larger and stronger banks with which we must now compete some of our competitors are substantially larger than we are which may give those competitors advantages such as a more diversified product and customer base the ability to reach more customers and potential customers operational efficiencies lowercost funding and larger branch networks many competitors are also focused on crossselling their products which could affect our ability to maintain or grow existing customer relationships or require us to offer lower interest rates or fees on our lending products or higher interest rates on deposits there can be no assurance that increased competition will not adversely affect our growth prospects and therefore our operations we also face competition from nonbank competitors such as brokerage companies department stores for some credit products leasing and factoring companies mutual fund and pension fund management companies and insurance companies nontraditional providers of banking services such as financial technology companies internet based ecommerce providers mobile telephone companies and internet search engines may offer andor increase their offerings of financial products and services directly to customers these nontraditional providers of banking services currently have an advantage over traditional providers because they are not subject to the same regulatory or legislative requirements to which we are subject several of these competitors may have long operating histories large customer bases strong brand recognition and significant financial marketing and other resources they may adopt more aggressive pricing and rates and devote more resources to technology infrastructure and marketing new competitors may enter the market or existing competitors may adjust their services with unique product or service offerings or approaches to providing banking services if we are unable to compete successfully with current and new competitors or if we are unable to anticipate and adapt our offerings to changing banking industry trends including technological changes our business may be adversely affected in addition our failure to anticipate or adapt to emerging technologies or changes in customer behavior effectively including among younger customers could delay or prevent our access to new digitalbased markets which would in turn have an adverse effect on our competitive position and business furthermore the widespread adoption of new technologies including cryptocurrencies and payment systems could require substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our existing products and services as we continue to grow our internet and mobile banking capabilities our customers may choose to conduct business or offer products in areas that may be considered speculative or risky such new technologies and the rise in customer use of internet and mobile banking platforms in recent years could negatively impact our investments in bank premises equipment and personnel for our branch network the persistence or acceleration of this shift in demand towards internet and mobile banking may necessitate changes to our retail distribution strategy which may include closing andor selling certain branches and restructuring our remaining branches and workforce these actions could lead to losses on these assets and increased expenditures to renovate reconfigure or close a number of our remaining branches or otherwise reform our retail distribution channel furthermore our failure to keep pace with innovation or to swiftly and effectively implement such changes to our distribution strategy could have an adverse effect on our competitive position increasing competition could also require that we increase the rates we offer on deposits or lower the rates we charge on loans which could also have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations it may also negatively affect our business results and prospects by among other things limiting our ability to increase our customer base and expand our operations and increasing competition for investment opportunities if our customer service levels were perceived by the market to be materially below those of our competitors we could lose existing and potential business if we are not successful in retaining and strengthening customer relationships we may lose market share incur losses on some or all of our activities or fail to attract new deposits or retain existing deposits which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations goodwill impairments may be required in relation to acquired businesses we have made business acquisitions for which it is possible that the goodwill which has been attributed to those businesses may have to be written down if our valuation assumptions are required to be reassessed as a result of any deterioration in the business underlying profitability asset quality or other relevant matters impairment testing with respect to goodwill is performed annually more frequently if impairment indicators are present and includes a comparison of the carrying amount of the reporting unit with its fair value if the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than the fair value the impairment is measured as this excess of carrying value over fair value we did not recognize any impairments of goodwill in or but did record a goodwill impairment of billion in based on future market conditions and the companys financial performance it is possible we may be required to record additional impairment of goodwill up to billion attributable to sc and sbna in the future there can be no assurance that we will not have to write down the value attributed to goodwill further in the future which would not impact riskbased capital ratios adversely but would adversely affect our results of operations and stockholders equity we rely on recruiting retaining and developing appropriate senior management and skilled personnel our continued success depends in part on the continued service of key members of our management team the ability to continue to attract train motivate and retain highly qualified professionals is a key element of our strategy the successful implementation of our growth strategy depends on the availability of skilled management both at our head office and at each of our business units if we or one of our business units or other functions fails to staff its operations appropriately or loses one or more of its key senior executives and fails to replace them in a satisfactory and timely manner our business financial condition and results of operations including control and operational risks may be adversely affected the financial industry in the united states has experienced and may continue to experience more stringent regulation of employee compensation which could have an adverse effect on our ability to hire or retain the most qualified employees in addition due to our relationship with santander we are subject to indirect regulation by the european central bank which has recently imposed compensation restrictions that may apply to certain of our executive officers and other employees under the crd iv prudential rules these restrictions may impact our ability to retain our experienced management team and key employees and our ability to attract appropriately qualified personnel which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations damage to our reputation could cause harm to our business prospects maintaining a positive reputation is critical to our attracting and maintaining customers investors and employees and conducting business transactions with our counterparties damage to our reputation can therefore cause significant harm to our business and prospects harm to our reputation can arise from numerous sources including among others employee misconduct litigation or regulatory outcomes failure to deliver minimum standards of service and quality dealing with sectors that are not well perceived by the public eg weapons industries dealing with customers on sanctions lists ratings downgrades compliance failures unethical behavior and the activities of customers and counterparties including activities that affect the environment negatively further adverse publicity regulatory actions or fines litigation operational failures or the failure to meet client expectations or other obligations could materially and adversely affect our reputation our ability to attract and retain clients or our sources of funding for the same or other businesses actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members of or individuals in the industry can also affect our reputation for example the role played by financial services firms in the financial crisis and increased regulatory supervision and enforcement have caused public perception of us and others in the financial services industry to decline activists increasingly target financial services firms with criticism for relationships with clients engaged in businesses whose products are perceived to be harmful to the health of customers or whose activities are perceived to affect public safety affect the environment climate or workers rights negatively such criticism could increase dissatisfaction among customers investors and employees of the company and damage the companys reputation alternatively yielding to such activism could damage the companys reputation with groups whose views are not aligned with those of the activists in either case certain clients and customers may cease to do business with the company and the companys ability to attract new clients and customers may be diminished preserving and enhancing our reputation also depends on maintaining systems procedures and controls that address known risks and regulatory requirements as well as our ability to timely identify understand and mitigate additional risks that arise due to changes in our businesses and the markets in which we operate the regulatory environment and customer expectations we could suffer significant reputational harm if we fail to identify and manage potential conflicts of interest properly the failure to adequately address or the perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with us or give rise to litigation or enforcement actions against us therefore there can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise in the future that could cause material harm to us while negative public opinion once was primarily a response to adverse coverage in traditional news media increased use of social media platforms has resulted in rapid dissemination of information and misinformation which can magnify potential harm to the companys reputation we may be the subject of misinformation and misrepresentations propagated deliberately to harm our reputation or for other deceitful purposes including by others seeking to gain an illegal market advantage by spreading false information about us there can be no assurance that we will be able to neutralize or contain false information that may be propagated regarding the company which could have an adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and prospects effectively fraudulent activity associated with our products or networks could cause us to suffer reputational damage the use of our products to decrease and our fraud losses to be materially adversely affected we are subject to the risk of fraudulent activity associated with merchants customers and other third parties handling customer information the risk of fraud continues to increase for the financial services industry in general credit and debit card fraud identity theft and related crimes are prevalent and perpetrators are growing more sophisticated our resources customer authentication methods and fraud prevention tools may not be sufficient to accurately predict or prevent fraud additionally our fraud risk continues to increase as third parties that handle confidential consumer information suffer security breaches and we expand our direct banking business and introduce new products and features our financial condition the level of our fraud chargeoffs and other results of operations could be materially adversely affected if fraudulent activity were to increase significantly highprofile fraudulent activity could negatively impact our brand and reputation in addition significant increases in fraudulent activity could lead to regulatory intervention and reputational and financial damage to our brands which could negatively impact the use of our products and services and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the bank engages in transactions with its subsidiaries or affiliates that others may not consider to be on an armslength basis the bank and its subsidiaries have entered into a number of services agreements pursuant to which we render services such as administrative accounting finance treasury legal services and others united states law applicable to certain financial institutions including the bank and other santander entities and offices in the us establish several procedures designed to ensure that the transactions entered into with or among our subsidiaries andor affiliates do not deviate from prevailing market conditions for those types of transactions the bank and its affiliates are likely to continue to engage in transactions with their respective affiliates future conflicts of interests among our affiliates may arise which conflicts are not required to be and may not be resolved in shusas favor technology and cybersecurity risks any failure to effectively maintain secure improve or upgrade our it infrastructure and management information systems in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on us our ability to remain competitive depends in part on our ability to maintain protect and upgrade our it on a timely and costeffective basis we must continually make significant investments and improvements in our it infrastructure in order to remain competitive there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the level of capital expenditures necessary to support the improvement or upgrading of our it infrastructure in the future any failure to improve or upgrade our it infrastructure and management information systems effectively and in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on us risks relating to data collection processing storage systems and security are inherent in our business like other financial institutions with a large customer base we have been subject to and are likely to continue to be the subject of attempted cyberattacks in light of the fact that we manage and hold confidential personal information of customers in the conduct of our banking operations as well as a large number of assets our business depends on the ability to process a large number of transactions efficiently and accurately and on our ability to rely on our digital technologies computer and email services spreadsheets software and networks as well as on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks the proper functioning of financial controls accounting and other data collection and processing systems is critical to our businesses and our ability to compete effectively losses can result from inadequate personnel inadequate or failed internal control processes and systems or external events that interrupt normal business operations we also face the risk that the design of our controls and procedures proves to be inadequate or is circumvented although we work with our clients vendors service providers counterparties and other third parties to develop secure transmission capabilities and prevent information security risk we routinely exchange personal confidential and proprietary information by electronic means which may be a target for attempted cyberattacks this is especially applicable in the current response to the covid19 pandemic and the shift we have experienced in having a significant part of our employees working from their homes for the time being as our employees access our secure networks through their home networks if we cannot maintain effective and secure electronic data and information management and processing systems or if we fail to maintain complete physical and electronic records this could result in disruptions to our operations claims from customers regulators employees and other parties violations of applicable privacy and other laws regulatory sanctions and serious reputational and financial harm to us many companies across the country and in the financial services industry have reported significant breaches in the security of their websites or other systems cybersecurity risks have increased significantly in recent years due to the development and proliferation of new technologies increased use of the internet and telecommunications technology to conduct financial transactions and increased sophistication and activities of organized crime groups statesponsored and individual hackers terrorist organizations disgruntled employees and vendors activists and other third parties financial institutions the government and retailers have in recent years reported cyber incidents that compromised data resulted in the theft of funds or the theft or destruction of corporate information and other assets we take protective measures and continuously monitor and develop our systems to protect our technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption we have policies practices and controls designed to prevent or limit disruptions to our systems and enhance the security of our infrastructure these include performing risk management for information systems that store transmit or process information assets identifying and managing risks to information assets managed by thirdparty service providers through ongoing oversight and auditing of the service providers operations and controls we develop controls regarding user access to software on the principle that access is forbidden to a system unless expressly permitted limited to the minimum amount necessary for business purposes and terminated promptly when access is no longer required we seek to educate and make our employees aware of information security and privacy controls and their specific responsibilities on an ongoing basis nevertheless while we have not experienced material losses or other material consequences relating to cyberattacks or other information or security breaches whether directed at us or third parties our systems software and networks as well as those of our clients vendors service providers counterparties and other third parties may be vulnerable to unauthorized access misuse computer viruses or other malicious code cyberattacks such as denial of service malware ransomware phishing and other events that could result in security breaches or give rise to the manipulation or loss of significant amounts of personal proprietary or confidential information of our customers employees suppliers counterparties and other third parties disrupt sabotage or degrade service on our systems or result in the theft or loss of significant levels of liquid assets including cash as cybersecurity threats continue to evolve and increase in sophistication we cannot guarantee the effectiveness of our policies practices and controls to protect against all such circumstances that could result in disruptions to our systems this is because among other reasons the techniques used in cyberattacks change frequently cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources and third parties may seek to gain access to our systems either directly or by using equipment or passwords belonging to employees customers thirdparty service providers or other authorized users of our systems in the event of a cyberattack or security breach affecting a vendor or other third party entity on whom we rely our ability to conduct business and the security of our customer information could be impaired in a manner to that of a cyberattack or security breach affecting us directly we also may not receive information or notice of the breach in a timely manner or we may have limited options to influence how and when the cyberattack or security breach is addressed as financial institutions are becoming increasingly interconnected with central agents exchanges and clearinghouses they may be increasingly susceptible to negative consequences of cyberattacks and security breaches affecting the systems of such third parties it could take a significant amount of time for a cyberattack to be investigated during which time we may not be in a position to fully understand and remediate the attack and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated any or all of which could further increase the costs and consequences associated with a particular cyberattack the perception of a security breach affecting us or any part of the financial services industry whether correct or not could result in a loss of confidence in our cybersecurity measures or otherwise damage our reputation with customers and third parties with whom we do business should such adverse events occur we may not have indemnification or other protection from the third party sufficient to compensate or protect us from the consequences as attempted cyberattacks continue to evolve in scope and sophistication we may incur significant costs in our attempts to modify or enhance our protective measures against such attacks to investigate or remediate any vulnerability or resulting breach or in communicating cyberattacks to our customers an interception misuse or mishandling of personal confidential or proprietary information sent to or received from a client vendor service provider counterparty or third party or a cyberattack could result in our inability to recover or restore data that has been stolen manipulated or destroyed damage to our systems and those of our clients customers and counterparties violations of applicable privacy and other laws or other significant disruption of operations including disruptions in our ability to use our accounting deposit loan and other systems and our ability to communicate with and perform transactions with customers vendors and other parties these effects could be exacerbated if we would need to shut down portions of our technology infrastructure temporarily to address a cyberattack if our technology infrastructure is not sufficiently redundant to meet our business needs while an aspect of our technology is compromised or if a technological or other solution to a cyberattack is slow to be developed even if we timely resolve the technological issues in a cyberattack a temporary disruption in our operations could adversely affect customer satisfaction and behavior expose us to reputational damage contractual claims regulatory supervisory or enforcement actions or litigation us banking agencies and other federal and state government agencies have increased their attention on cybersecurity and data privacy risks and have proposed enhanced risk management standards that would apply to us for example the california consumer privacy act which took effect on january requires among other things notification to affected individuals when there has been a security breach of their personal data and imposes increased privacy and security obligations of entities handling certain personal information of individuals such legislation and regulations relating to cybersecurity and data privacy may require that we modify systems change service providers or alter business practices or policies regarding information security handling of data and privacy changes such as these could subject us to heightened operational costs to the extent we do not successfully meet supervisory standards pertaining to cybersecurity we could be subject to supervisory actions litigation and reputational damage or ordered to change our business practices policies or systems in a manner that adversely impacts our operating results risks associated with our majorityowned consolidated subsidiary the financial results of sc could have a negative impact on the companys operating results and financial condition sc historically has provided a significant source of funding to the company through earnings our investment in sc involves risk including the possibility that poor operating results of sc could negatively affect the operating results of shusa factors that affect the financial results of sc in addition to those which have been previously addressed include but are not limited to periods of economic slowdown may result in decreased demand for automobiles as well as declining values of automobiles and other consumer products used as collateral to secure outstanding loans higher gasoline prices the general availability of consumer credit and other factors which impact consumer confidence could increase loss frequency and decrease consumer demand for automobiles in addition during an economic slowdown servicing costs may increase without a corresponding increase in finance charge income changes in the economy may impact the collateral value of repossessed automobiles and repossession and foreclosure sales may not yield sufficient proceeds to repay the receivables in full and result in losses scs growth strategy is subject to significant risks some of which are outside its control including general economic conditions the ability to obtain adequate financing for growth laws and regulatory environments in the states in which the business seeks to operate competition in new markets the ability to attract new customers the ability to recruit qualified personnel and the ability to obtain and maintain all required approvals permits and licenses on a timely basis our relationship with fca is a significant source of our loan and lease originations loss of our relationship with fca including as a result of termination of our agreement with fca could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations scs business may be negatively impacted if it is unsuccessful in developing and maintaining relationships with automobile dealerships that correlate to scs ability to acquire loans and automotive leases in addition economic downturns may result in the closure of dealerships and corresponding decreases in sales and loan volumes scs business could be negatively impacted if it is unsuccessful in developing and maintaining its serviced for others portfolio as this is a significant and growing portion of scs business strategy if an institution for which sc currently services assets chooses to terminate scs rights as a servicer or if sc fails to add additional institutions or portfolios to its servicing platform sc may not achieve the desired revenue or income from this platform sc has repurchase obligations in its capacity as a servicer in securitizations and whole loan sales if significant repurchases of assets or other payments are required under its responsibility as a servicer this could have a material adverse effect on scs financial condition results of operations and liquidity the obligations associated with being a public company require significant resources and management attention which increases the costs of scs operations and may divert focus from business operations as a result of its ipo sc is now required to remain in compliance with the reporting requirements of the sec and the nyse maintain corporate infrastructure required of a public company and incur significant legal and financial compliance costs which may divert sc managements attention and resources from implementing its growth strategy the market price of sc common stock may be volatile which could cause the value of an investment in sc common stock to decline conditions affecting the market price of sc common stock may be beyond scs control and include general market conditions economic factors actual or anticipated fluctuations in quarterly operating results changes in or failure to meet publicly disclosed expectations related to future financial performance analysts estimates of scs financial performance or lack of research or reports by industry analysts changes in market valuations of similar companies future sales of sc common stock or additions or departures of its key personnel scs business and results of operations could be negatively impacted if it fails to manage and complete divestitures sc regularly evaluates its portfolio in order to determine whether an asset or business may no longer be aligned with its strategic objectives when sc decides to sell assets or a business it may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives sc may also experience greater costs and synergies than expected and the impact of the divestiture on revenue may be larger than projected additionally sc may ultimately dispose of assets or a business at a price or on terms that are less favorable than those it had originally anticipated after reaching a definitive agreement with a buyer sc typically must satisfy preclosing conditions and the completion of the transaction may be subject to regulatory and governmental approvals failure of these conditions and approvals to be satisfied or obtained may prevent sc from completing the transaction divestitures involve a number of risks including the diversion of management and employee attention significant costs and expenses and a decrease in revenues and earnings associated with the divested business divestitures may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business such as through continuing equity ownership guarantees indemnities or other financial obligations under these arrangements performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations sc continues to classify loans from its bluestem portfolio as heldforsale with a carrying value of approximately billion as of december sc remains a party to agreements with bluestem that obligate it to among other things purchase new advances originated by bluestem along with existing balances on accounts with new advances through april both parties have the right to terminate this agreement upon written notice if certain events were to occur including if there is a material adverse change in the financial reporting condition of either party although sc is seeking a third party willing and able to take on this obligation it may not be successful in finding such a party and bluestem may not agree to the substitution sc has recorded significant lowerofcostormarket adjustments on this portfolio and may continue to do so as long as the portfolio is held particularly due to the new volume it is committed to purchase until sc finds a third party to assume this obligation there is a risk that material changes to its relationship with bluestem or the loss or discontinuance of bluestems business would materially and adversely affect scs business financial condition and results of operations scs business could be negatively impacted if access to funding is reduced adverse changes in scs abs program or in the abs market generally could materially adversely affect its ability to securitize loans on a timely basis or upon terms acceptable to sc this could increase its cost of funding reduce its margins or cause it to hold assets until investor demand improves as with shusa adverse outcomes to current and future litigation against sc may negatively impact its business financial condition and results of operations and liquidity sc is party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings in particular as a consumer finance company it is subject to various consumer claims and litigation seeking damages and statutory penalties some litigation against it could take the form of class action complaints by consumers as the assignee of loans originated by automotive dealers it also may be named as a codefendant in lawsuits filed by consumers principally against automotive dealers the chrysler agreement may not result in currently anticipated levels of growth and is subject to certain performance conditions that could result in termination of the agreement if sc fails to meet certain of these performance conditions fca may seek to terminate the agreement in addition fca has the option to acquire an equity participation in the chrysler capital portion of scs business in february sc entered into the chrysler agreement with fca through which sc launched the chrysler capital brand in may through the chrysler capital brand sc originates privatelabel loans and leases to facilitate the purchase of fca vehicles by consumers and fcafranchised automotive dealers the financing services sc provides under the chrysler agreement include providing credit lines to finance fcafranchised dealers acquisitions of vehicles and other products fca sells or distributes automotive loans and leases to finance consumer acquisitions of new and used vehicles at fcafranchised dealerships financing for commercial and fleet customers and ancillary services in addition sc may facilitate for an affiliate offerings to dealers for dealer loan financing construction loans real estate loans working capital loans and revolving lines of credit on june the company entered into an amendment of the chrysler agreement which modified the chrysler agreement to among other things adjust certain performance metrics exclusivity commitments and payment provisions in may in accordance with the terms of the chrysler agreement sc paid fca a million upfront nonrefundable payment to be amortized over ten years in addition in june in connection with the execution of the amendment to the chrysler agreement sc paid a million upfront fee to fca the unamortized portion would be recognized as expense immediately if the chrysler agreement were terminated in accordance with its terms as part of the chrysler agreement sc received limited exclusivity rights to participate in specified minimum percentages of certain of fcas financing incentive programs which include loan rate subvention and automotive lease residual support subvention among other covenants sc has committed to certain revenue sharing arrangements sc bears the risk of loss on loans originated pursuant to the chrysler agreement while fca shares in any residual gains and losses in respect of automotive leases subject to specific provisions in the chrysler agreement including limitations on scs participation in such gains and losses the chrysler agreement is subject to early termination in certain circumstances including scs failure to meet certain key performance metrics provided fca treats sc in a manner consistent with other comparable oems fca may also terminate the agreement if among other circumstances i a person other than santander and its affiliates or scs other stockholders owns or more of sc common stock and santander and its affiliates own fewer shares of common stock than such person ii sc controls or becomes controlled by an oem that competes with fca or iii certain of scs credit facilities become impaired in addition under the chrysler agreement fca has the option to acquire for fair market value an equity participation in the business offering and providing the financial services contemplated by the chrysler agreement there is no maximum limit on the size of fcas potential equity participation although the chrysler agreement contains provisions that are designed to address a situation in which the parties disagree on the fair market value of the equity participation interest there is a risk that sc ultimately receives less than what it believes to be the fair market value for such interest and the loss of its associated revenue and profits may not be offset fully by the immediate proceeds for such interest there can be no assurance that sc would be able to redeploy the immediate proceeds for such interest in other businesses or investments that would provide comparable returns thereby reducing scs profitability scs ability to realize the full strategic and financial benefits of its relationship with fca depends in part on the successful development of its chrysler capital business which requires a significant amount of managements time and effort as well as the success of fcas business if fca exercises its equity option if the chrysler agreement or fcas limited exclusivity obligations thereunder were to terminate or if sc otherwise is unable to realize the expected benefits of its relationship with fca including as a result of fcas bankruptcy or loss of business there could be a materially adverse impact to shusas and scs business financial condition results of operations profitability loan and lease volume the credit quality of shusas and scs portfolio liquidity reputation funding costs and growth and shusas and scs ability to obtain or find other oem relationships or to otherwise implement our business strategy could be materially adversely affected general risk factors macroeconomic and political risks developments stemming from the uk withdrawal from the eu could have a material adverse effect on us the uks withdrawal from the eu may have negative effects on global economic conditions and global financial markets the eu and the uk recently signed the euuk trade and cooperation agreement which provides a basic framework for free trade in goods and cooperation in certain policy areas however there are many aspects pertaining to trade and cooperation between the eu and the uk that remain subject to negotiation and there is still uncertainty about the longterm relationship between the eu and the uk and whether the uk will replicate or replace certain eu laws the uks withdrawal from the eu has contributed to political and economic uncertainty in the uk and may contribute to such environments in eu member states such political and economic uncertainty could have a material adverse effect on economic conditions and the stability of financial markets in the uk and could significantly reduce market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets while the company does not maintain a presence in the uk political and economic uncertainty in countries with significant economies and relationships to the global financial industry have in the past led to declines in market liquidity and activity levels volatile market conditions a contraction of available credit lower or negative interest rates weaker economic growth and reduced business confidence on an international level each of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations business and industry risks we depend in part upon dividends and other funds from subsidiaries most of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries as a result our ability to pay dividends to the extent we decide to do so depends in part on the ability of our subsidiaries to generate earnings and pay dividends to us payment of dividends distributions and advances by our subsidiaries will be contingent on our subsidiaries earnings and business considerations and are limited by legal and regulatory restrictions additionally our right to receive any assets of our subsidiaries as an equity holder of such subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization will be effectively subordinated to the claims of our subsidiaries creditors including trade creditors our ability to maintain our competitive position depends in part on the success of new products and services we offer our clients and our ability to continue offering products and services from third parties and we may not be able to manage various risks we face as we expand our range of products and services that could have a material adverse effect on us the success of our operations and our profitability depend in part on the success of new products and services we offer our clients and our ability to continue offering products and services from third parties however we cannot guarantee that our new products and services will be responsive to client demands or successful once they are offered to our clients or that they will be successful in the future in addition our clients needs or desires may change over time and such changes may render our products and services obsolete outdated or unattractive and we may not be able to develop new products that meet our clients changing needs our success is also dependent on our ability to anticipate and leverage new and existing technologies that may have an impact on products and services in the banking industry technological changes may further intensify and complicate the competitive landscape and influence client behavior if we cannot respond in a timely fashion to the changing needs of our clients we may lose clients which could in turn materially and adversely affect us the introduction of new products and services can entail significant time and resources including regulatory approvals substantial risks and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services including technical and control requirements that may need to be developed and implemented rapid technological change in the industry our ability to access technical and other information from our clients and the significant and ongoing investments required to bring new products and services to market in a timely manner at competitive prices our failure to manage these risks and uncertainties also exposes us to the enhanced risk of operational lapses which may result in the recognition of financial statement liabilities regulatory and internal control requirements capital requirements competitive alternatives vendor relationships and shifting market preferences may also determine whether initiatives can be brought to market in a manner that is timely and attractive to our clients failure to manage these risks in the development and implementation of new products or services successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation as well as on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition in addition the cost of developing products that are not launched is likely to affect our business financial condition and results of operations any or all of these factors individually or collectively could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we rely on third parties for important products and services thirdparty vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure such as loan and deposit servicing systems internet connections and network access third parties can be sources of operational risk to us including with respect to security breaches affecting those parties we may be required to take steps to protect the integrity of our operational systems thereby increasing our operational costs and potentially decreasing customer satisfaction in addition any problems caused by these third parties including as a result of their not providing us their services for any reason their performing their services poorly or employee misconduct could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to customers and otherwise to conduct business which could lead to reputational damage and regulatory investigations and intervention replacing these thirdparty vendors could also entail significant delays and expense further the operational and regulatory risk we face as a result of these arrangements may be increased to the extent that we restructure them any restructuring could involve significant expense to us and entail significant delivery and execution risk which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if a third party obtains access to our customer information and that third party experiences a cyberattack or breach of its systems this could result in several negative outcomes for us including losses from fraudulent transactions potential legal and regulatory liability and associated damages penalties and restitution increased operational costs to remediate the consequences of the third partys security breach and harm to our reputation from the perception that our systems or thirdparty systems or services that we rely on may not be secure our business and financial performance could be adversely affected directly or indirectly by disasters natural or otherwise terrorist activities or international hostilities neither the occurrence nor potential impact of disasters such as earthquakes hurricanes tornadoes floods and other severe weather conditions pandemics and other significant public health emergencies dislocations fires explosions or other catastrophic accidents or events terrorist activities or international hostilities can be predicted however these occurrences could impact us directly for example by causing significant damage to our facilities preventing a subset of our employees from working for a prolonged period and otherwise preventing us from conducting our business in the ordinary course or indirectly as a result of their impact on our borrowers depositors other customers suppliers or other counterparties we could also suffer adverse consequences to the extent that disasters terrorist activities or international hostilities affect the financial markets or the economy in general or in any particular region these types of impacts could lead for example to an increase in delinquencies bankruptcies and defaults that could result in our experiencing higher levels of nonperforming assets net chargeoffs and provisions for credit losses our ability to mitigate the adverse consequences of such occurrences is in part dependent on the quality of our resiliency planning and our ability to anticipate the nature of any such event that may occur the adverse impact of disasters terrorist activities or international hostilities also could be increased to the extent that there is a lack of preparedness on the part of national or regional emergency responders or on the part of other organizations and businesses with which we deal financial reporting and control risks changes in accounting standards could impact reported earnings the accounting standard setters and other regulatory bodies periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our consolidated financial statements these changes can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations as well as affect the calculation of our capital ratios in some cases we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in the restatement of prior period financial statements for example as noted in note to the consolidated financial statements in this s may have adverse regulatory economic and reputational consequences if we are not able to file our periodic reports within the time periods prescribed by the sec among other consequences we would be unable to use form s3 registration statements until we have timely filed our sec periodic reports for a period of consecutive months our inability to use form s3 registration statements would increase the time and resources we need to spend if we choose to access the public capital markets
