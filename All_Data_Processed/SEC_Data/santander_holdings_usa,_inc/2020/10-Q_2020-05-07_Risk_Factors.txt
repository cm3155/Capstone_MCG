item risk factors the company is subject to a number of risks potentially impacting its business financial condition results of operations and cash flow that are set forth under part i item ia risk factors in the companys annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 2019in addition to the risk factors disclosed in that form 10k for the year ended december the company is subject to risks related to the covid19 outbreak discussed further below our adoption of the new standard on the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments and its resulting impact on our acl and impairments may prove to be insufficient to absorb probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio the cecl standard replaces the incurred loss impairment framework in current gaap with one that reflects expected credit losses over the full expected life of financial assets and commitments and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information including estimation of future expected changes in macroeconomic conditions additionally the standard changes the accounting framework for pcd htm debt securities and loans and requires measurement of afs debt securities using an allowance instead of reducing the carrying amount as under the previous otti framework the company adopted this standard using the modified retrospective method for all financial assets measured at amortized cost and net investment in leases results for reporting periods beginning after january are presented under asc while prior period amounts continue to be reported in accordance with previously applicable gaap managements evaluation takes into consideration the risks in the loan portfolio past loan and lease loss experience specific loans with loss potential geographic and industry concentrations delinquency trends economic forecasts and other relevant factors in accordance with gaap and based on regulatory requirements while management uses the best information available to make such evaluations future adjustments to the acl may be necessary if conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluations future reserves may be different due to changes in macroeconomic conditions provisions for credit losses are charged to credit loss expense in amounts sufficient to maintain the acl at levels considered adequate to cover ecl in the companys hfi loan portfolios the process for determining our acl is complex and we may from time to time make changes to our process for determining our acl in addition regulatory agencies periodically review our acl as well as our methodology for calculating our acl and may require an increase in the credit loss expense or the recognition of additional loan chargeoffs based on judgments different than those of management changes that we make to enhance our process for determining our acl may lead to an increase in our acl any increase in our acl will result in a decrease in net income and capital and may have a material adverse effect on us material changes to our methodology for determining our allowance for loan losses could result in the need to restate our financial statements or fines penalties potential regulatory action and damage to our reputation the current outbreak covid19 has materially impacted our business and the continuance of this pandemic or any future outbreak of any other highly contagious diseases or other public health emergency could materially and adversely impact our business financial condition liquidity and results of operations covid19 was first reported in china in december and has now spread throughout the world including in the united states the outbreak has been declared a public health emergency of international concern and a pandemic by the world health organization and the president of the united states has made a declaration that the covid19 outbreak in the united states constitutes a national emergency as of the date hereof a significant number of countries and the majority of state governments have also made emergency declarations related to the outbreak and have attempted to slow community spread of the virus by providing social distancing guidelines issuing stayathome orders and mandating the closure of certain nonessential businesses the actions taken by authorities however may not be sufficient to mitigate the spread of covid19 further these actions are not always coordinated or consistent across jurisdictions but in general have been rapidly expanding in scope and intensity and have caused economic hardship in the jurisdictions in which they have been implemented for example in many jurisdictions businesses have been required to temporarily close or restrict their operations further even for businesses that have remained open consumer demand has deteriorated rapidly as a result we have recently experienced a significant decline in our origination of loans and leases this decline in volume may be exacerbated because for example fca announced in march that it has suspended production of new vehicles at certain facilities across europe and north america which may reduce the availability of new vehicles for fca dealers after dealerships reopen or consumer demand increases closures and disruptions to businesses in the united states have led to negative effects on our customers similar to many other financial institutions we have taken and will continue to take measures to mitigate our customers covid related economic challenges in march we announced that we were providing additional support to customers employees and communities during the covid19 pandemic and revised our servicing practices to increase the maximum number of permitted monthly payment extensions grant waivers for late charges and provide lease extensions unlike the regional impact of natural disasters such as hurricanes the covid19 outbreak is impacting customers nationwide and is expected to have a materially more significant impact on the performance of our loan and auto lease portfolios than even the most severe historical natural disaster we have experienced a sharp increase in requests for extensions and modifications related to covid19 nationwide and a significant number of such extensions and modifications have been granted further we have temporarily suspended and may continue to temporarily suspend involuntary repossessions although we may elect to reinitiate involuntary repossessions at any time these customer support programs may negatively impact our financial performance and other results of operations in the near term and if the covid19 pandemic leads us to conduct such activities on a large scale for a specific period of time the number of customers experiencing hardship related directly or indirectly to the outbreak of covid19 increases or if our customer support programs are not effective in mitigating the effect of covid19 on our customers our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected further government and regulatory authorities could also enact laws regulations executive orders and other guidance that allow customers to forego making scheduled payments for some period of time require modifications to receivables eg waiving accrued interest preclude creditors from exercising certain rights or taking certain actions with respect to collateral including repossession or liquidation of the collateral or mandate limited operations or temporary closures of the company or our vendors as nonessential businesses or otherwise while we have business continuity plans in place if significant portions of our or our vendors workforces are unable to work effectively as a result of the covid19 pandemic including because of illness stayathome orders facility closures reductions in services or hours of operation or ineffective remote work arrangements there may be servicing disruptions which could result in reduced collection effectiveness or our ability to operate our business and satisfy our obligations under our thirdparty servicing agreements each of these scenarios could have negative effects on our business financial condition and results of operations we rely upon our ability to access various credit facilities to fund our operations as international trade and business activity has slowed and supply chains are disrupted related to the covid19 pandemic global credit and financial markets have recently experienced and may continue to experience significant disruption and volatility during the first quarter of financial markets experienced significant declines and volatility and such market conditions may continue andor precede recessionary conditions in the us economy under these circumstances we may experience some or all of the risks related to market volatility and recessionary conditions described under the caption we are vulnerable to disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets in the risk factors section of our form 10k these include reduced demand for our products and services and reduced access to capital markets funding these risks could have significant adverse impacts on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows governmental and regulatory authorities have recently implemented fiscal and monetary policies and initiatives to mitigate the effects of the pandemic on the economy and individual businesses and households such as the reduction of the federal reserves benchmark interest rate to near zero in march however these governmental and regulatory actions may not be successful in mitigating the adverse economic effects of covid19 and could affect our net interest income and reduce our profitability sustained adverse economic effects from the pandemic may also result in downgrades in our credit ratings or adversely affect the interest rate environment if our access to funding is reduced or if our costs to obtain such funding significantly increases our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected due to the evolving nature of the pandemic we are currently unable to estimate the adverse impact of covid19 on our business financial condition liquidity and results of operations the pandemic may also cause us to experience lower originations and higher credit losses in our lending portfolio reduced access to funding or significantly increased costs of funding impairment of our goodwill and other financial assets and other materially adverse impacts on our business financial condition liquidity and results of operations
