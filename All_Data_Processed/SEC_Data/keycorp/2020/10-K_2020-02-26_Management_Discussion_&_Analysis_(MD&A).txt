report the page locations of specific sections that we refer to are presented in the table of contents to review our financial condition and results of operations for and a comparison between the and results see item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of our s fluctuations in the gdp and the effects of weather and natural disasters such as droughts floods and hurricanes management considers these variables and all other available information when establishing the final level of the alll these variables and others may result in actual loan losses that differ from the originally estimated amounts since our loss rates are applied to large pools of loans even minor changes in the level of estimated losses can significantly affect managements determination of the appropriate alll because those changes must be applied across a large portfolio to illustrate an increase in estimated losses equal to onetenth of one percent of our consumer loan portfolio as of december would indicate the need for a million increase in the alll the same increase in estimated losses for the commercial loan portfolio would result in a million increase in the alll such adjustments to the alll can materially affect financial results following the above examples a million increase in the consumer loan portfolio allowance would have reduced our earnings on an aftertax basis by approximately million or per common share a million increase in the commercial loan portfolio allowance would have reduced earnings on an aftertax basis by approximately million or per common share our accounting policy related to the alll is disclosed in note under the heading allowance for loan and lease losses as described in note summary of significant accounting policies on january we adopted asc financial instruments credit losses and as such an expected credit loss methodology specifically current expected credit losses for the remaining life of our loans and leases will be used to estimate the appropriate level of the alll valuation methodologies fair value measurements we measure or monitor many of our assets and liabilities on a fair value basis fair value is generally defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price as opposed to the price that would be paid to acquire the asset or received to assume the liability an entry price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions while management uses judgment when determining the price at which willing market participants would transact when there has been a significant decrease in the volume or level of activity for the asset or liability in relation to normal market activity managements objective is to determine the point within the range of fair value estimates that is most representative of a sale to a thirdparty investor under current market conditions the value to us if the asset or liability were held to maturity is not included in the fair value estimates a fair value measure should reflect the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability including the assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset and the risk of nonperformance fair value is measured based on a variety of inputs fair value may be based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets level valuations if market prices are not available quoted market prices for similar instruments traded in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active or modelbased valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market are used level valuations where observable market data is not available the valuation is generated from model based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market but observable based on our specific data level valuations unobservable assumptions reflect our estimates for assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability valuation techniques typically include option pricing models discounted cash flow models and similar techniques but may also include the use of market prices of assets or liabilities that are not directly comparable to the subject asset or liability the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a fair value higher or lower than carrying value considerable judgment may be involved in determining the amount that is most representative of fair value for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value our policy is to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements for those items where there is an active market in certain cases when market observable inputs for modelbased valuation techniques may not be readily available we are required to make judgments about assumptions market participants would use in estimating the fair value of the financial instrument the models used to determine fair value adjustments are regularly evaluated by management for relevance under current facts and circumstances changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data for example reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable when market data is not available we use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value fair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary measure of accounting fair value is used on a nonrecurring basis to measure certain assets or liabilities including heldtomaturity securities commercial loans held for sale and oreo for impairment or for disclosure purposes in accordance with current accounting guidance impairment analysis also relates to longlived assets goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not likely to be recoverable and exceeds its fair value in determining the fair value management uses models and applies the techniques and assumptions previously discussed see note under the heading fair value measurements and note fair value measurements for a detailed discussion of determining fair value including pricing validation processes goodwill the valuation and testing methodologies used in our analysis of goodwill impairment are summarized in note under the heading goodwill and other intangible assets although accounting guidance permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether additional goodwill impairment testing is required key chose to utilize the quantitative approach in the quantitative approach is a two step goodwill impairment test the first step in goodwill impairment testing is to determine the fair value of each reporting unit the amount of capital being allocated to our reporting units as a proxy for the carrying value is based on riskbased regulatory capital requirements fair values are estimated using an equal combination of market and income approaches the market approach incorporates comparable public company multiples along with data related to recent merger and acquisition activity the income approach consists of discounted cash flow modeling that utilizes internal forecasts and various other inputs and assumptions a multiyear internal forecast is prepared for each reporting unit and a terminal growth rate is estimated for each one based on market expectations of inflation and economic conditions in the financial services industry earnings projections for each reporting unit are adjusted for after tax cost savings expected to be realized by a market participant the discount rate applied to our cash flows is derived from the capm the buildup to the discount rate includes a riskfree rate 5year adjusted beta based on peer companies a market equity risk premium a size premium and a company specific risk premium the discount rates differ between our reporting units as they have varying levels of risk a sensitivity analysis is typically performed on key assumptions such as the discount rates and cost savings estimates if the fair value determined in step is greater than the carrying value then the reporting units goodwill is deemed not to be impaired if the fair value is less than the carrying value then the second step is performed which measures the amount of impairment by comparing the carrying amount of goodwill to its implied fair value the second step of the goodwill impairment test was not required in effective january upon the adoption of asu the second step of the goodwill impairment test was eliminated we continue to monitor the impairment indicators for goodwill and other intangible assets and to evaluate the carrying amount of these assets quarterly additional information is provided in note goodwill and other intangible assets derivatives and hedging we primarily use interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk for asset and liability management purposes these derivative instruments modify the interest rate characteristics of specified onbalance sheet assets and liabilities our accounting policies related to derivatives reflect the current accounting guidance which provides that all derivatives should be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value after taking into account the effects of master netting agreements accounting for changes in the fair value ie gains or losses of a particular derivative depends on whether the derivative has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further on the type of hedging relationship the application of hedge accounting requires significant judgment to interpret the relevant accounting guidance as well as to assess hedge effectiveness identify similar hedged item groupings and measure changes in the fair value of the hedged items we believe our methods of addressing these judgments and applying the accounting guidance are consistent with both the guidance and industry practices additional information relating to our use of derivatives is included in note under the heading derivatives and hedging and note derivatives and hedging activities contingent liabilities guarantees and income taxes note commitments contingent liabilities and guarantees summarizes contingent liabilities arising from litigation and contingent liabilities arising from guarantees in various agreements with third parties under which we are a guarantor and the potential effects of these items on the results of our operations we record a liability for the fair value of the obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of a guarantee but there is a risk that our actual future payments in the event of a default by the guaranteed party could exceed the recorded amount see note commitments contingent liabilities and guarantees for a comparison of the liability recorded and the maximum potential undiscounted future payments for the various types of guarantees that we had outstanding at december it is not always clear how the internal revenue code and various state tax laws apply to transactions that we undertake in the normal course of business we may record tax benefits and then have those benefits contested by the irs or state tax authorities we have provided tax reserves that we believe are adequate to absorb potential adjustments that such challenges may necessitate however if our judgment later proves to be inaccurate the tax reserves may need to be adjusted which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and capital additionally we conduct quarterly assessments that determine the amount of deferred tax assets that are morelikelythannot to be realized and therefore recorded the available evidence used in connection with these assessments includes a history of pretax income projected future taxable income potential taxplanning strategies and projected future reversals of deferred tax liabilities these assessments are subjective and may change based on these criteria and all available positive and negative evidence we establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when we are unable to conclude it is more likely than not that they will be realized however if our assessments prove incorrect they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which they occur for further information on our accounting for income taxes see note summary of significant accounting policies and note income taxes during we did not significantly alter the manner in which we applied our critical accounting policies or developed related assumptions and estimates accounting and reporting developments accounting guidance pending adoption at december table start standard required adoption description effect on financial statements or other significant matters asu simplifying the accounting for income taxes january early adoption is permitted this asu simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the existing guidance such as exceptions related to the incremental approach for intraperiod tax allocation the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period when a yeartodate loss exceeds the anticipated loss and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities when a foreign subsidiary becomes an equity method investment and when a foreign equity method investment becomes a subsidiary along with general improvements it adds simplifications related to franchise taxes the tax basis of goodwill and the method for recognizing an enacted change in tax laws the guidance also specifies that an entity is not required to allocate the consolidated amount of certain tax expense to a legal entity not subject to tax in its own separate financial statements the guidance should be applied on either a retrospective modified retrospective or prospective basis depending on the amendment the adoption of this accounting guidance is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations asu clarifying the interactions between topic 321investmentsequity securities topic investments equity method and joint ventures and topic derivatives and hedging january early adoption is permitted this guidance clarifies that when applying the measurement alternative in topic companies should consider certain observable transactions that require the application or discontinuance of the equity method under topic it also clarifies that companies should not consider whether the underlying securities in certain forward contracts and purchased options would be accounted for under the equity method or fair value option when determining the method of accounting for those contracts this guidance should be applied on a prospective basis the adoption of this accounting guidance is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations table end european sovereign and nonsovereign debt exposures our total european sovereign and nonsovereign debt exposure is
