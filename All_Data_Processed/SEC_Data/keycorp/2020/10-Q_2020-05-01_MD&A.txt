risk profile and strategy is different than the one we had during the financial crisis we have significantly reduced our exposure to highrisk sectors and industries and have positioned key to perform well through all phases of the business cycle including highly stressed environments like the one in which we operated during the first quarter of our moderate risk profile will continue to inform our credit decisions and the way we underwrite loans capital and liquidity were clear strengths for us during the first quarter of we have participated in several rounds of governmentmandated stress tests

capitalized for purposes of the pca framework however investors should not regard this determination as a representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of keybank because the pca framework is intended to serve a limited supervisory function moreover it is important to note that the pca framework does not apply to bhcs like keycorp recent regulatory capitalrelated developments

settlement transactions between a banking entity and covered funds for which the banking entity serves as investment adviser investment manager or sponsor ii clarify exclusions from the covered fund definition for foreign public funds loan securitizations and small business investment companies and iii permit banking entities to invest in or sponsor certain types of funds that do not raise the

current prior to any relief do not need to be categorized as tdrs and that financial institutions are not expected to designate loans with deferrals granted due to covid19 as past due because of the deferral the cares act enacted on march contains a number of provisions that affect banking organizations the cares act provides funding for various programs under which the federal government will lend to guarantee loans to or make investments in businesses banking organizations are expected to play a role in some of these programs and when they do so they will be subject to certain requirements one of these programs is the paycheck protection program ppp a program administered by the small business administration the sba to provide loans to small businesses for payroll and other basic expenses during the covid19 crisis the loans can be made by sbacertified lenders and are guaranteed by the sba the loans are eligible to be forgiven if certain conditions are satisfied in which

and enforcement responsibility with respect to consumer protection requirements they will take into account the unique circumstances impacting borrowers and institutions resulting from the covid19 emergency and that they do not expect to take a consumer compliance public enforcement action against an institution provided that the circumstances were related to this emergency and the institution made good faith efforts to support borrowers and comply with the consumer protection requirements and addressed any needed corrective action the federal reserve has established several lending facilities that are intended to support the flow of credit to households businesses and governments one of these facilities is the paycheck protection program liquidity facility ppplf which was set up

simulation var model to measure the potential adverse effect of changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and credit spreads on the fair value of our covered positions and other noncovered positions we analyze market risk by portfolios and do not separately measure and monitor our portfolios by risk type var is calculated using daily observations over a oneyear time horizon and approximates a confidence level statistically this means that we would expect to incur losses greater than var on average five out of trading days or three to four times each quarter we also

march this amount included million of mortgagebacked securities positions and million of assetbacked securities positions specific risk is the price risk of individual financial instruments which is not accounted for by changes in broad market risk factors and is measured through a standardized approach market risk weighted assets including the specific risk calculations are run quarterly by the mrm in accordance with the market risk rule and approved by the chief market risk officer nontrading market risk most of our nontrading market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations and its impacts on our traditional loan and deposit products as well as investments hedging relationships longterm debt and certain shortterm borrowings interest rate risk which is inherent in the banking industry is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest income and the eve that result from changes in interest rates and differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of assets and liabilities we manage the exposure to changes in net interest income and the eve in accordance with our risk appetite and in accordance with the board approved erm policy interest rate risk positions are influenced by a number of factors including the balance sheet positioning that arises out of customer preferences for loan and deposit products economic conditions the competitive environment within our markets changes in market interest rates that affect client activity and our hedging investing funding and capital positions the primary components of interest rate risk exposure consist of reprice risk basis risk yield curve risk and option risk reprice risk is the exposure to changes in the level of interest rates and occurs when the volume of interestbearing liabilities and the volume of interestearning assets they fund eg deposits used to fund loans do not mature or reprice at the same time basis risk is the exposure to asymmetrical changes in interest rate indices and occurs when floatingrate assets and floatingrate liabilities reprice at the same time but in response to different market factors or indexes yield curve risk is the exposure to nonparallel changes in the slope of the yield curve where the yield curve depicts the relationship between the yield on a particular type of security and its term to maturity and occurs when interestbearing liabilities and the interestearning assets that they fund do not price or reprice to the same term point on the yield curve option risk is the exposure to a customer or counterpartys ability to take advantage of the interest rate environment and terminate or reprice one of our assets liabilities or offbalance sheet instruments prior to contractual maturity without a penalty option risk occurs when exposures to customer and counterparty early withdrawals or prepayments are not mitigated with an offsetting position or appropriate compensation the management of nontrading market risk is centralized within corporate treasury the risk committee of our board provides oversight of nontrading market risk the erm committee and the alco review reports on the interest rate risk exposures described above in addition the alco reviews reports on stress tests and sensitivity analyses related to interest rate risk the erm committee and the alco have various responsibilities related to managing nontrading market risk including recommending approving and monitoring strategies that maintain risk positions within approved tolerance ranges the alm policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of interest rate risk and is administered by the alco the mrm as the second line of defense provides additional oversight net interest income simulation analysis the primary tool we use to measure our interest rate risk is simulation analysis for purposes of this analysis we estimate our net interest income based on the current and projected composition of our on and offbalance sheet positions accounting for recent and anticipated trends in customer activity the analysis also incorporates assumptions for the current and projected interest rate environments and balance sheet growth projections based on a most likely macroeconomic view the modeling incorporates investment portfolio and swap portfolio balances consistent with managements desired interest rate risk positioning the simulation model estimates the amount of net interest income at risk by simulating the change in net interest income that would occur if rates were to gradually increase or decrease from current levels over the next months subject to a basis point floor in rates figure presents the results of the simulation analysis at march and march at march our simulated impact to changes in interest rates was modest the asset sensitive position increased from as a result of the significant widening of the spread between libor and the fed funds target rate that developed in the latter portion of march as the majority of floating rate loans reprice with libor and administered rate deposits align more closely with the fed funds target rate a widening of that relationship creates both higher current earnings and the risk that the relationship normalizes over time this increase in exposure is anticipated to be short term as the relationship between short term market rates is anticipated to normalize tolerance levels for risk management require the development of remediation plans to maintain residual risk within tolerance if simulation modeling demonstrates that a gradual parallel basis point increase or basis point decrease in interest rates over the next months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than current modeled exposure is within board approved tolerances figure simulated change in net interest income march march basis point change assumption shortterm rates tolerance level interest rate risk assessment simulation analysis produces a sophisticated estimate of interest rate exposure based on assumptions input into the model we tailor certain assumptions to the specific interest rate environment and yield curve shape being modeled and validate those assumptions on a regular basis however actual results may differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to unanticipated changes to the balance sheet composition customer behavior product pricing market interest rates changes in managements desired interest rate risk positioning investment funding and hedging activities and repercussions from unanticipated or unknown events we also perform regular stress tests and sensitivity analyses on the model inputs that could materially change the resulting risk assessments assessments are performed using different shapes of the yield curve including steepening or flattening of the yield curve immediate changes in market interest rates and changes in the relationship of money market interest rates assessments are also performed on changes to the following assumptions loan and deposit balances the pricing of deposits without contractual maturities changes in lending spreads prepayments on loans and securities investment funding and hedging activities and liquidity and capital management strategies the results of additional assessments indicate that net interest income could increase or decrease from the base simulation results presented in figure net interest income is highly dependent on the timing magnitude frequency and path of interest rate increases and the associated assumptions for deposit repricing relationships lending spreads and the balance behavior of transaction accounts if fixed rate assets increase by billion or fixed rate liabilities decrease by billion then the benefit to rising rates would decrease by approximately basis points if the interestbearing liquid deposit beta assumption increases or decreases by eg to then the benefit to rising rates would decrease or increase by approximately basis points our current interest rate risk position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk depending on the competitive environment and client behavior that may affect the actual volume mix maturity and repricing characteristics of loan and deposit flows corporate treasury discretionary activities related to funding investing and hedging may also change as a result of changes in customer business flows or changes in managements desired interest rate risk positioning as changes occur to both the configuration of the balance sheet and the outlook for the economy management proactively evaluates hedging opportunities that may change our interest rate risk profile we also conduct simulations that measure the effect of changes in market interest rates in the second and third years of a threeyear horizon these simulations are conducted in a manner similar to those based on a 12month horizon to capture longerterm exposures we calculate exposures to changes of the eve as discussed in the following section economic value of equity modeling eve complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure beyond and 36month horizons eve modeling measures the extent to which the economic values of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates eve is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate basis point increase or decrease in interest rates measuring the resulting change in the values of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments and comparing those amounts with the base case of the current interest rate environment this analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with noncontractual maturities those assumptions are based on historical behaviors as well as our expectations we develop remediation plans that would maintain residual risk within tolerance if this analysis indicates that our eve will decrease by more than in response to an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates we are operating within these guidelines as of march management of interest rate exposure we use the results of our various interest rate risk analyses to formulate alm strategies to achieve the desired risk profile while managing to our objectives for capital adequacy and liquidity risk exposures specifically we manage interest rate risk positions by purchasing securities issuing term debt with floating or fixed interest rates and using derivatives we predominantly use interest rate swaps and options which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities figure shows all swap positions that we hold for alm purposes these positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreedupon amounts of assets and liabilities ie notional amounts to another interest rate index for example fixedrate debt is converted to a floating rate through a receive fixedpay variable interest rate swap the volume maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as we adjust our broader alm objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged for more information about how we use interest rate swaps to manage our risk profile see note derivatives and hedging activities figure

respectively liquidity risk management liquidity risk which is inherent in the banking industry is measured by our ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations and fund new business opportunities at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions factors affecting liquidity our liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect events an example of a direct event would be a downgrade in our public credit ratings by a rating agency examples of indirect events events unrelated to us that could impair our access to liquidity would be an act of terrorism or war natural disasters global pandemics including covid19 political events or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation mutual fund or hedge fund similarly market speculation or rumors about us or the banking industry in general may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources see part ii item risk factors

nonperforming loans in the first quarter of operational and compliance risk management like all businesses we are subject to operational risk which is the risk of loss resulting from human error or malfeasance inadequate or failed internal processes and systems and external events these events include among other things threats to our cybersecurity as we are reliant upon information systems and the internet to conduct our business activities operational risk also encompasses compliance risk which is the risk of loss from violations of or noncompliance with laws rules and regulations prescribed practices and ethical standards under the doddfrank act large financial companies like key are subject to heightened prudential standards and regulation this heightened level of regulation has increased our operational risk resulting operational risk losses andor additional regulatory compliance costs could take the form of explicit charges increased operational costs harm to our reputation or foregone opportunities we seek to mitigate operational risk through identification and measurement of risk alignment of business strategies with risk appetite and tolerance and a system of internal controls and reporting we continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to improve the oversight of our operational risk and to ensure compliance with laws rules and regulations for example an operational event database tracks the amounts and sources of operational risk and losses this tracking mechanism helps to identify weaknesses and to highlight the need to take corrective action we also rely upon software programs designed to assist in assessing operational risk and monitoring our control processes this technology has enhanced the reporting of the effectiveness of our controls to senior management and the board the operational risk management program provides the framework for the structure governance roles and responsibilities as well as the content to manage operational risk for key the compliance risk committee serves the same function in managing compliance risk for key the operational risk committee supports the erm committee by identifying early warning events and trends escalating emerging risks and discussing forwardlooking assessments the operational risk committee includes attendees from each of the three lines of defense primary responsibility for managing and monitoring internal control mechanisms lies with the managers of our various lines of business the operational risk committee and compliance risk committee are senior management committees that oversee our level of operational and compliance risk and direct and support our operational and compliance infrastructure and related activities these committees and the operational risk management and compliance functions are an integral part of our erm program our risk review function regularly assesses the overall effectiveness of our operational risk management and compliance programs and our system of internal controls risk review reports the results of reviews on internal controls and systems to senior management and the risk and audit committees and independently supports the risk committees oversight of these controls see part ii item risk factors for a discussion of additional operational risks stemming from the covid19 global pandemic cybersecurity we maintain comprehensive cyber incident response plans and we devote significant time and resources to maintaining and regularly updating our technology systems and processes to protect the security of our computer systems software networks and other technology assets against attempts by third parties to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information destroy data disrupt or degrade service sabotage systems shut down access to systems for ransom or cause other damage as the threat landscape continues to evolve critical infrastructure including financial services remains a top target for cyberattacks the emergence of covid19 has created a unique situation globally with many more employees and thirdparty service providers working from home which inherently introduces additional risk cyberattacks may include but are not limited to attacks that are intended to disrupt or disable banking services and prevent banking transactions attempts to breach the security of systems and data and social engineering attempts aimed at tricking employees and clients into providing sensitive information or executing financial transactions cyberattack risks may also occur with our thirdparty technology service providers and may result in financial loss or liability that could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations cyberattacks could also interfere with thirdparty providers ability to fulfill their contractual obligations to us recent highprofile cyberattacks have targeted retailers credit bureaus and other businesses for the purpose of acquiring the confidential information including personal financial and credit card information of customers some of whom are customers of ours we may incur expenses related to the investigation of such attacks or related to the protection of our customers from identity theft as a result of such attacks we may also incur expenses to enhance our systems or processes to protect against cyber or other security incidents risks and exposures related to cyberattacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats as well as due to the expanding use of internet banking mobile banking and other technologybased products and services by us and our clients to date key has not experienced material disruption of our operations or material harm to our customers as a result of the heightened threat landscape or cyberattacks see part ii item risk factors for a discussion of additional cybersecurity risks stemming from the covid19 global pandemic as described in more detail starting on page of our form 10k under the heading risk management overview the board serves in an oversight capacity ensuring that keys risks are managed in a manner that is effective and balanced and adds value for the shareholders the boards risk committee has primary oversight for enterprisewide risk at keycorp including operational risk which includes cybersecurity the risk committee reviews and provides oversight of managements activities related to the enterprisewide risk management framework including cyberrelated risk the erm committee chaired by the chief executive officer and comprising other senior level executives is responsible for managing risk including cyberrelated risk and ensuring that the corporate risk profile is managed in a manner consistent with our risk appetite the erm committee reports to the boards risk committee gaap to nongaap

investors to evaluate a company they have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under gaap the tangible common equity ratio and the return on tangible common equity ratio have been a focus for some investors and management believes that these ratios may assist investors in analyzing keys capital

and methodologies these choices are critical not only are they necessary to comply with gaap they also reflect our view of the appropriate way to record and report our overall financial performance all accounting policies are important and all policies described in note summary of significant accounting policies beginning on page of our form 10k should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance note basis of presentation and accounting policies of this report should also be reviewed for more information on accounting standards that have been adopted during the period in our opinion some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a critical effect on our financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility these policies apply to areas of relatively greater business importance or require us to exercise judgment and to make assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements because these assumptions and estimates are based on current circumstances they may prove to be inaccurate or we may find it necessary to change them we rely heavily on the use of judgment assumptions and estimates to make a number of core decisions including accounting for the alll contingent liabilities guarantees and income taxes derivatives and related hedging activities and assets and liabilities that involve valuation methodologies in addition we may employ outside valuation experts to assist us in determining fair values of certain assets and liabilities a brief discussion of each of these areas appears on pages through of our form 10k during the first three months of we did not significantly alter the manner in which we applied our critical accounting policies or developed related assumptions and estimates except for our alll as a result of the adoption of asc on january in conjunction with the adoption of asc the critical accounting policy and estimate disclosure for our alll was updated from what was disclosed in our form 10k as follows allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loans and leases represents managements estimate of all expected credit losses over the expected contractual life of our existing loan portfolio determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain these critical estimates include significant use of our own historical data and complex methods to interpret them we have an ongoing process to evaluate and enhance the quality quantity and timeliness of our data and interpretation methods used in the determination of these allowances these evaluations are inherently subjective as they require material estimates and may be susceptible to significant change and include among others pd lgd outstanding balance of the loan movement through delinquency stages amounts and timing of expected future cash flows value of collateral which may be obtained from third parties economic forecasts which are obtained from a third party provider qualitative factors such as changes in current economic conditions that may not be reflected in modeled results as described in our accounting policy related to the alll in note basis of presentation and accounting policies of this report under the heading allowance for loan and lease losses we employ a disciplined process and methodology to establish our allowance for loan and lease losses which has three main components i asset specific individual loan reserves ii quantitative formulaic or pooled reserves and iii qualitative judgmental reserves we use a nondcf factorbased approach to estimate expected credit losses that include component pdlgdead models as well as less complex estimation methods for smaller loan portfolios probability of default models estimate the likelihood a borrower will cease making payments as agreed these models use observed loanlevel information and projected paths of macroeconomic variables borrower credit attributes including fico scores of consumers and internally assigned risk ratings for commercial borrowers are significant inputs to the models consumer fico scores are refreshed quarterly and commercial risk ratings are updated annually with select borrowers updated more frequently the macroeconomic trends that have a significant impact on the probability of default vary by portfolio segment exposure at default models estimate the loan balance at the time the borrower stops making payments we use an amortization based formulaic approach to estimate account level ead for all term loans we use portfolio specific methods in each of our revolving product portfolios lgd models estimate the loss we will suffer once a loan is in default account level inputs to lgd models include collateral attributes such as loan to value if we observe limitations in the data or models we use model overlays to make adjustments to model outputs to capture a particular risk or compensate for a known limitation these variables and others may result in actual loan losses that differ from the originally estimated amounts this estimate produced by our models is forwardlooking and requires management to use forecasts about future economic conditions to determine the expected credit loss over the remaining life of an instrument we use a two year reasonable and supportable period across all products to forecast economic conditions as the length of the life of a financial asset increases these inputs may become impractical to estimate as reasonable and supportable we believe the two year time horizon appropriately aligns with our business planning available industry guidance and reliability of various forecasting services following this two year period in which supportable forecasts can be generated for all modeled loan portfolios we revert expected credit losses to a level that is consistent with our historical information by reverting the macroeconomic variables model inputs to their long run average we revert to historical loss rates for less complex estimation methods for smaller portfolios a four quarter reversion period is used where the macroeconomic variables linearly revert to their long run average following the two year reasonable and supportable period we use a year lookback period for determining long run historical average o f the macroeconomic variables we determined the year lookback period is appropriate as it captures the previous two economic cycles including the last downturn and our more recent positive credit experience a thirdparty economic scenario is the source of macroeconomic projections including the interest rate forecasts used in our models we also consider the results of different economic forecasts ranging from more benign to more severe in determining potential qualitative adjustments to the alll the alll is sensitive to a variety of internal factors such as changes in the mix and level of loan balances outstanding portfolio performance and assigned risk ratings the alll is also sensitive to a variety of external factors such as the general health of the economy real estate demand and values interest rates unemployment rates gdp pandemics and the effects of weather and natural disasters such as droughts floods and hurricanes management considers these variables and all other available information when establishing the final level of the alll the following tables illustrate the potential variability of the alll to negative changes in our quantitative inputs both the stress example for the portfolio and the economic forecast example reference the relative impact to the assumptions used to inform the alll at march including the economic outlook that incorporates the estimated impact from the covid19 pandemic the severity of the lowmoderate and moderatehigh economic stress scenarios reflect deeper declines in the macroeconomic outlook and a longer duration of the impact from the covid19 pandemic from that captured in the alll at march note that these analyses demonstrate the sensitivity of the alll to key quantitative assumptions however they do not reflect an expected outcome as qualitative factors related to idiosyncratic risk factors changes in current economic conditions that may not be reflected in quantitatively derived results and other relevant factors must be considered to ensure the alll reflects our best estimate of current expected credit losses with the unprecedented economic uncertainty caused by the covid19 pandemic future alll results may vary considerably as the magnitude of the pandemic and impact of the united states monetary and fiscal response becomes more defined for the commercial portfolio low moderate and high stress levels were applied to key portfolio factors eg risk ratings utilization based on these assumptions the expected credit losses on commercial loans as of march would increase by approximately to times current levels alll input stress level low moderate high portfolio factors downside economic scenarios provided by a third party vendor were also applied to commercial loans as of march given the dynamic nature of our loss forecasting models the downside scenarios inherently capture some level of expected migration in portfolio factors based on the alternate scenarios selected expected credit losses on commercial loans would increase by approximately to times current levels alll input stress level lowmoderate moderatehigh economic scenario for the consumer portfolio low moderate and high stress levels were applied to key portfolio factors eg fico ltv utilization based on these assumptions

other significant matters asu simplifying the accounting for income taxes january early adoption is permitted this asu simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the existing guidance such as exceptions related to the incremental approach for intraperiod tax allocation the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period when a yeartodate loss exceeds the anticipated loss and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities when a foreign subsidiary becomes an equity method investment and when a foreign equity method investment becomes a subsidiary along with general improvements it adds simplifications related to franchise taxes the tax basis of goodwill and the method for recognizing an enacted change in tax laws the guidance also specifies that an entity is not required to allocate the consolidated amount of certain tax expense to a legal entity not subject to tax in its own separate financial statements the guidance should be applied on either a retrospective modified retrospective or prospective basis depending on the amendment the adoption of this accounting guidance is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations asu clarifying the interactions between topic 321investments equity securities topic investments equity method and joint ventures and topic derivatives and hedging january early adoption is permitted this guidance clarifies that when applying the measurement alternative in topic companies should consider certain observable transactions that require the application or discontinuance of the equity method under topic it also clarifies that companies should not consider whether the underlying securities in certain forward contracts and purchased options

accounting guidance adopted in measurement of credit losses on financial instruments asu asu asu asu asu asu asu on january we adopted asu financial instruments credit losses asc measurement of credit losses on financial instruments which replaces the incurredloss methodology that recognized losses when a probable threshold was met with an expectedloss methodology specifically recognizing current expected credit losses cecl for the remaining life of the asset at the time of origination or acquisition the cecl methodology applies to loans debt securities and other financial assets and net investment in leases measured at amortized cost it also applies to offbalance sheet credit exposures loan commitments standby letters of credit financial guarantees and other similar instruments assets in the scope of asc are presented at the net amount expected to be collected after deducting the allowance for credit losses from the amortized cost basis of the assets asc also requires credit losses relating to availableforsale debt securities that management does not intend to sell or believes that it is more likely than not they will be required to sell to be recorded through an allowance rather than a reduction of the carrying amount asc replaces the purchased credit impaired concept of accounting previously required under subtopic with a purchased financial assets with credit deterioration pcd concept in accordance with asc we did not reassess whether recognized purchased credit impaired loans met the criteria of a pcd loan and modifications to individual acquired loans accounted for in pools were tdrs as of the date of adoption at adoption we elected to not maintain the pools of loans previously accounted for under subtopic the prospective application resulted in a million adjustment to the amortized cost basis of pcd loans to reflect the addition to the allowance for loans and leases as of january after the adjustment for the allowance for the loans and leases the noncredit discount of million will be accreted to interest income using the interest method based on the effective interest rate determined after the adjustment from credit losses as of

following are additional disclosures about our significant accounting policies related to cecl allowance for heldtomaturity securities debt securities that we have the intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as heldtomaturity and are carried at cost and adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts using the interest method this method produces a constant rate of return on the adjusted carrying amount management classifies the heldtomaturity portfolio into the following major security types agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations agency residential mortgagebacked securities agency commercial mortgagebacked securities asset backed securities and other management measures expected credit losses on heldtomaturity securities on a collective basis by major security type the estimate of expected losses considers historical credit loss information that is adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts we do not measure expected credit losses on heldtomaturity securities in which historical credit loss information adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts results in an expectation that nonpayment of the amortized cost basis is zero all of our mortgagebacked securities are issued by us governmentsponsored enterprises or gnma are highly rated by major rating agencies and have a long history of no credit losses other securities are comprised of state of israel bonds denominated and paid in us dollars israel bonds have a long history of no credit losses additionally as of march the state of israels credit rating remains stable among fitch moodys and sp a a1 a allowance for availableforsale securities debt securities that we intend to hold for an indefinite period of time but that may be sold in response to changes in interest rates prepayment risk liquidity needs or other factors are classified as availableforsale and reported at fair value realized gains and losses resulting from sales of securities using the specific identification method are included in other income on the income statement unrealized gains and losses net of income taxes are recorded in equity as a component of aoci for availableforsale securities in an unrealized loss position we first assess whether we intend to sell or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis if either of these criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met the securitys amortized cost basis is written down to fair value in other income on the income statement for debt securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria we evaluate whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors in making this assessment management considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost nature of the security the underlying collateral and the financial condition of the issuer among other factors if this assessment indicates a credit loss exists the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security if the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis a credit loss exists and an allowance for availableforsale securities is recorded for the credit loss limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for availableforsale securities is recognized in other comprehensive income changes in the allowance for availableforsale securities are recorded as provision for or reversal of credit loss losses are charged against the allowance for availableforsale securities when management believes the uncollectibility of an availableforsale security is confirmed or when either criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met loans accrued interest on loans is included in other assets on the balance sheet and is excluded from the calculation of the allowance for credit losses due to our chargeoff policy to reverse accrued interest on nonperforming loans against interest income in a timely manner expected credit losses on net investments in leases including any unguaranteed residual asset are included in the alll purchased credit deteriorated pcd loans in addition to originating loans we also acquire loans through portfolio purchases or acquisitions of other financial services companies purchased loans that have evidence of more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination are deemed pcd loans in accordance with asc we did not reassess whether recognized purchased credit impaired loans met the criteria of a pcd loan as of the date of adoption pcd loans are initially recorded at fair value along with an allowance for credit losses determined using the same methodology as originated loans the sum of the loans purchase price and allowance for credit losses becomes its initial amortized cost basis the difference between the initial amortized cost basis and the par value of the loan is a noncredit discount or premium which is amortized into interest income over the life of the loan subsequent changes to the allowance for credit losses are recorded through provision for credit losses nonperforming loans nonperforming loans are loans for which we do not accrue interest income and include commercial and consumer loans and leases as well as current year tdrs and nonaccruing tdr loans from prior years nonperforming loans do not include loans held for sale once a loan is designated nonaccrual the interest accrued but not collected is reversed against interest income and payments subsequently received are applied to principal until qualifying for return to accrual allowance for loan and lease losses we estimate the alll using relevant available information from internal and external sources relating to past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts the alll is measured on a collective pool basis when similar risk characteristics exist our portfolio segments include commercial and consumer each of these two segments comprises multiple loan classes classes are characterized by similarities in initial measurement risk attributes and the manner in which we monitor and assess credit risk the commercial segment is composed of commercial and industrial commercial real estate and commercial lease financing loan classes the consumer lending segment is composed of residential mortgage home equity consumer direct credit card and consumer indirect loan classes the alll represents our current estimate of lifetime credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio at the balance sheet date in determining the alll we estimate expected future losses for the loans entire contractual term adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate the contractual term excludes expected extensions renewals and modifications the alll is the sum of three components i asset specific individual loan reserves ii quantitative formulaic or pooled reserves and iii qualitative judgmental reserves asset specific individual component loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis loans evaluated individually are not included in the collective evaluation we have elected to apply the practical expedient to measure expected credit losses of a collateral dependent asset using the fair value of the collateral less any costs to sell when foreclosure is not probable when repayment of the loan is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty individual reserves are determined as follows for commercial nonaccruing loans greater than or equal to a defined dollar threshold individual reserves are determined based on an analysis of the present value of the loans expected future cash flows the loans observable market value or the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell for commercial nonaccruing loans below the defined dollar threshold an established lgd percentage is multiplied by the loan balance and the results are aggregated for purposes of measuring specific reserve impairment the population of individually assessed consumer loans includes loans deemed collateral dependent in addition to all tdrs the expected loss for these loans is estimated based on the present value of the loans expected future cash flows except in instances where the loan is collateral dependent in which case the loan is written down based on the collaterals fair market value less costs to sell quantitative component we use a nondcf factorbased approach to estimate expected credit losses that include component pdlgdead models as well as less complex estimation methods for smaller loan portfolios pd this component model is used to estimate the likelihood that a borrower will cease making payments as agreed the major contributors to this are the borrower credit attributes and macroeconomic trends the objective of the pd model is to produce default likelihood forecasts based on the observed loanlevel information and projected paths of macroeconomic variables lgd this component model is used to estimate the loss on a loan once a loan is in default ead estimates the loan balance at the time the borrower stops making payments for all term loans an amortization based formulaic approach is used for account level ead estimates we calculate ead using a portfolio specific method in each of our revolving product portfolios for line products that are unconditionally cancellable the balances will either use a paydown curve or be held flat through the life of the loan additional information about the critical estimates and judgments we make in developing these models is provided in the section allowance for loan and lease losses under the heading critical accounting policies and estimates in item of this report qualitative component the alll also includes identified qualitative factors related to idiosyncratic risk factors changes in current economic conditions that may not be reflected in quantitatively derived results and other relevant factors to ensure the alll reflects our best estimate of current expected credit losses while our reserve methodologies strive to reflect all relevant risk factors there continues to be uncertainty associated with but not limited to potential imprecision in the estimation process due to the inherent time lag of obtaining information and normal variations between estimates and actual outcomes we provide additional reserves that are designed to provide coverage for losses attributable to such risks the alll also includes factors that may not be directly measured in the determination of individual or collective reserves such qualitative factors may include the nature and volume of the institutions financial assets the existence growth and effect of any concentrations of credit the volume and severity of past due financial assets the volume of nonaccrual assets and the volume and severity of adversely classified or graded assets the value of the underlying collateral for loans that are not collateral dependent the institutions lending policies and procedures including changes in underwriting standards and practices for collections writeoffs and recoveries the quality of the institutions credit review function the experience ability and depth of the institutions lending investment collection and other relevant management and staff the effect of other external factors such as the regulatory legal and technological environments competition and events such as natural disasters and actual and expected changes in international national regional and local economic and business conditions and developments in which the institution operates that affect the collectability of financial assets liability for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments the liability for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments such as letters of credit and unfunded loan commitments is included in accrued expense and other liabilities on the balance sheet expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual period in which we are exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by us the liability for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments is adjusted as a provision for credit losses the estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated useful life consistent with our estimation process on our loan and lease portfolio we use a nondcf factorbased approach to estimate expected credit losses that include component pdlgdead models as well as less complex estimation methods for smaller portfolios simplifying the test for goodwill impairment asu on january we adopted asu the asu amends asc topic intangibles goodwill and other and eliminates the second step of the test for goodwill impairment under the new guidance key will compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount if the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value we are required to recognize an impairment charge for this amount the new method applies to all reporting units and the performance of a qualitative assessment is still allowable we will monitor for impairment indicators and conduct our annual goodwill test as of october the adoption of this accounting guidance must be applied prospectively and is not currently expected to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations reference rate reform topic facilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting asu this quarter we adopted asu upon issuance the amendments provide optional expedients and exceptions for certain contracts hedging relationships and other transactions that reference libor or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of rate reform the guidance is effective from the date of issuance until december the guidance permits key not to apply modification accounting or remeasure lease payments in lease contracts if the changes to the contract are related to the discontinuation of the reference rate if certain criteria are met the amendments also allow exceptions to the dedesignation criteria of the hedging relationship and the assessment of hedge effectiveness during the transition period it also allows key to make a one time election to sell transfer or both sell and transfer debt securities classified as held to maturity that reference a rate affected by reference rate reform and that are classified as held to maturity before january this one time election may be made at any time after march but no later than december key has not yet made a determination on whether it will make this election at the time of adoption the guidance did not have a significant impact on

drivers portfolio attributes such as remaining term outstanding balance risk ratings fico and delinquency also drive alll changes our alll models were designed to capture the correlation between economic and portfolio changes as such evaluating shifts in individual portfolio attributes and macroeconomic variables in isolation may not be indicative of past or future performance economic outlook as of march the covid19 pandemic has created unprecedented economic stress and uncertainty in the us and globally we used a thirdparty economic forecast updated in march to estimate our expected credit losses as of march this forecast considered the global pandemic impact as well as the united states monetary and fiscal response and we determined such forecast to be a reasonable view of the outlook for the global economy given the available information at current quarter ended the scenario includes a notable economic slowdown over the next two years in markets in which we operate gdp is expected to decline significantly during 2q20 recovering in late the unemployment rate remains elevated over the next year starting a steady improvement in the second half of as of quarterend many sectors of the economy have essentially shut down consumer spending has slowed unemployment claims have increased and there has been a decline in oil prices however the monetary and fiscal policy response including the cares act is intended to assist both consumers and businesses while cognizant of potentially more adverse economic outlooks we also considered that the governments stimulus efforts and programs instituted by the federal reserve will partially offset the economic contraction and as such the scenario selected reasonably captured the ultimate expected loss experience for our portfolio as of march to the extent we identified incremental credit risk that was not captured by the third party economic forecast we addressed the risk through qualitative adjustments as a result of the unprecedented economic uncertainty caused by the covid19 pandemic our future loss estimates may vary considerably as a result of changes in the economy from our march assumptions as well as the magnitude of the pandemic and impact of the united states monetary and fiscal response becomes more defined commercial segment the alll from continuing operations for the commercial segment increased by million or from january the overall increase in the allowance is driven by updated economic forecasts that capture expected deterioration triggered by the global covid19 pandemic the negative impact on our oil gas portfolio due to commodity price declines and significant portfolio growth within pass rated credits the primary economic forecast drivers in the current environment are the unemployment rate which impacts all commercial portfolios and real estate price indices which predominately impact our commercial real estate portfolio while oil gas price forecasts are included as economic variables in our commercial and industrial portfolio we performed a detailed review of our oil gas portfolio and applied additional incremental reserves to address the recent decline in oil gas prices from january to march commercial loans grew by billion or with the substantial growth primarily concentrated in pass rated credits additional portfolio drivers include risk ratings and remaining term which remained relatively flat quarteroverquarter across product types consumer segment the alll from continuing operations for the consumer segment increased by million or from january the overall increase in the allowance is driven by updated economic forecasts that capture expected deterioration triggered by the global covid19 pandemic the main driver in the economic forecast is the notable increase in unemployment levels which is most impactful for our credit card portfolio deterioration in the hpi outlook is also contributing to the alll increase for the residential mortgage and home equity books incremental credit risk considerations as a result of the pandemic which may not be captured by the updated economic forecasts are addressed through qualitative

risk profile the prevalent risk characteristic for both commercial and consumer loans is the risk of loss arising from an obligors inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms evaluation of this risk is stratified and monitored by the loan risk rating grades assigned for the commercial loan portfolios and the refreshed fico score assigned for the consumer loan portfolios the internal risk grades assigned to loans follow our definitions of pass and criticized which are consistent with published definitions of regulatory risk classifications loans with a pass rating represent those loans not classified on our rating scale for problem credits as minimal credit risk has been identified criticized loans are those loans that either have a potential weakness deserving managements close attention or have a welldefined weakness that may put full collection of contractual cash flows at risk borrower fico scores provide information about the credit quality of our consumer loan portfolio as they provide an indication as to the likelihood that a debtor will repay its debts the scores are obtained from a nationally recognized consumer rating agency and are presented in the tables below at the dates indicated most extensions of credit are subject to loan grading or scoring loan grades are assigned at the time of origination verified by credit risk management and periodically reevaluated thereafter this risk rating methodology blends our judgment with quantitative modeling commercial loans generally are assigned two internal risk ratings the first rating reflects the probability that the borrower will default on an obligation the second rating reflects expected recovery rates on the credit facility default probability is determined based on among other factors the financial strength of the borrower an assessment of the borrowers management the borrowers competitive position within its industry sector and our view of industry risk in
