item risk factors as a financial services organization we are subject to a number of risks inherent in our transactions and present in the business decisions we make described below are the primary risks and uncertainties that if realized could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows and our access to liquidity the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face our erm program incorporates risk management throughout our organization to identify understand and manage the risks presented by our business activities our erm program identifies keys major risk categories as credit risk compliance risk operational risk liquidity risk market risk reputation risk strategic risk and model risk these risk factors and other risks we may face are discussed in more detail in other sections of this report i credit risk we have concentrated credit exposure in commercial and industrial loans commercial real estate loans and commercial leases as of december approximately of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial and industrial loans commercial real estate loans including commercial mortgage and construction loans and commercial leases these types of loans are typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans and have a different risk profile the deterioration of a larger loan or a group of these loans could cause a significant increase in nonperforming loans which could result in a net loss of earnings from these loans an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses and an increase in loan chargeoffs should the fundamentals of the commercial real estate market deteriorate our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected the strong recovery in commercial real estate over the past several years in particular the multifamily property sector has contributed to a surge in investment and development activity as a result property values are elevated and oversupply is a concern in certain markets substantial deterioration in property market fundamentals could have an impact on our portfolio with a large portion of our clients active in real estate and specifically multifamily real estate a correction in the real estate markets could impact the ability of borrowers to make debt service payments on loans a portion of our commercial real estate loans are construction loans typically these properties are not fully leased at loan origination the borrower may require additional leasing through the life of the loan to provide cash flow to support debt service payments if property market fundamentals deteriorate sharply the execution of new leases could slow compromising the borrowers ability to cover the debt service payments we are subject to the risk of defaults by our loan counterparties and clients many of our routine transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of counterparties and clients including financial statements credit reports and other information we may also rely on representations of those counterparties clients or other third parties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information the inaccuracy of that information or those representations affects our ability to accurately evaluate the default risk of a counterparty or client given the doddfrank legislative mandate to centrally clear eligible derivative contracts we rely on central clearing counterparties to remain open and operationally viable at all times the possibility of a large member failure or a cybersecurity breach could result in a disruption in this market various factors may cause our allowance for loan and lease losses to increase we maintain an alll a reserve established through a provision for loan and lease losses charged to expense that represents our estimate of losses based on our evaluation of risks within our existing portfolio of loans the level of the allowance at december reflects our ongoing evaluation of industry concentrations specific credit risks loan and lease loss experience current loan portfolio quality present economic political and regulatory conditions and incurred losses inherent in the current loan portfolio the determination of the appropriate level of the alll inherently involves a degree of subjectivity and requires that we make significant estimates of current credit risks and current trends all of which may undergo material changes as described in note summary of significant accounting policies on january we adopted asc financial instrumentscredit losses and as such in determining the alll under cecl we must estimate expected lifetime credit losses based on information about past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers the softening of certain macroeconomic variables that we are more susceptible to such as gdp unemployment corporate bond rates household income year mortgage rates and real estate values along with new information regarding existing loans identification of additional problem loans and other factors both within and outside of our control may indicate the need for an increase in the alll declining asset prices could adversely affect us during the great recession the volatility and disruption that the capital and credit markets experienced reached extreme levels this severe market disruption led to the failure of several substantial financial institutions which caused the credit markets to constrict and also caused a widespread liquidation of assets these asset sales along with asset sales by other leveraged investors including some hedge funds rapidly drove down prices and valuations across a wide variety of traded asset classes asset price deterioration has a negative effect on the valuation of certain of the asset categories represented on our balance sheet and reduces our ability to sell assets at prices we deem acceptable although the recovery has been in place for some time a new recession would likely reverse recent positive trends in asset prices ii compliance risk we are subject to extensive government regulation supervision and tax legislation as a financial services institution we are subject to extensive federal and state regulation supervision and tax legislation banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds the dif consumers taxpayers and the banking system as a whole not our debtholders or shareholders these regulations increase our costs and affect our lending practices capital structure investment practices dividend policy ability to repurchase our common shares and growth among other things keybank and keycorp remain covered institutions under the doddfrank acts heightened prudential standards and regulations including its provisions designed to protect consumers from financial abuse like similarlysituated institutions key undergoes routine scrutiny from bank supervisors in the examination process and is subject to enforcement of regulations at the federal and state levels particularly with respect to consumer bankingrelated practices as well as compliance with aml bsa and office of foreign assets control efforts federal rulemaking bodies continue to pass new or modifications to significant regulations with upcoming effective dates there has also been an increase in state legislative activity particularly in areas such as student lending and privacy as new privacyrelated laws and regulations such as the california consumer privacy act are implemented in jurisdictions in which keybank operates the time and resources needed for us to comply with such laws and regulations as well as our potential liability for noncompliance and reporting obligations in the case of data breaches may significantly increase compliance with these laws and regulations may require us to change our policies procedures and technology for information security and segregation of data which could among other things make us more vulnerable to operational failures and subject us to monetary penalties for breach of such laws and regulations as a result some uncertainty remains as to the aggregate impact upon key of significant regulations changes to existing statutes and regulations and taxes including industryspecific taxes and surcharges or their interpretation or implementation could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways these changes may subject us to additional costs and increase our litigation risk should we fail to appropriately comply such changes may also impact consumer behavior limit the types of financial services and products we may offer affect the investments we make and change the manner in which we operate certain federal regulations have been in existence for decades without modification to account for modern banking practices such as digital delivery of products and services which can create challenges in execution and in the examination process emerging technologies such as cryptocurrencies could limit keybanks ability to track the movement of funds keybanks ability to comply with bsaaml and other regulations is dependent on its ability to improve detection and reporting capabilities and reduce variation in control processes and oversight accountability additionally federal banking law grants substantial enforcement powers to federal banking regulators this enforcement authority includes among other things the ability to assess civil money penalties fines or restitution to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and affiliated parties these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations for practices determined to be unsafe or unsound or for practices or acts that are determined to be unfair deceptive or abusive failure to comply with these and other regulations and supervisory expectations related thereto may result in fines penalties lawsuits regulatory sanctions reputational damage or restrictions on our business for more information see supervision and regulation in item of this report changes in accounting policies standards and interpretations could materially affect how we report our financial condition and results of operations the fasb periodically changes the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of keys financial statements additionally those bodies that establish andor interpret the financial accounting and reporting standards such as the fasb sec and banking regulators may change prior interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially affect how key records and reports its financial condition and results of operations in some cases key could be required to retroactively apply a new or revised standard resulting in changes to previously reported financial results iii operational risk we are subject to a variety of operational risks in addition to the other risks discussed in this section we are subject to operational risk which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error inadequate or failed internal processes internal controls systems and external events operational risk includes the risk of fraud by employees clerical and recordkeeping errors nonperformance by vendors threats from cyber activity and computertelecommunications malfunctions fraudulent activity has escalated become more sophisticated and is ever evolving as there are more options to access financial services for instance in our form 8k filed july we disclosed that on or about july we discovered fraudulent activity associated with transactions conducted in the third quarter of by a business customer of keybank this fraudulent activity resulted in million of net loan chargeoffs in operational risk also encompasses compliance and legal risk which is the risk of loss from violations of or noncompliance with laws rules regulations prescribed practices or ethical standards as well as the risk of our noncompliance with contractual and other obligations we are also exposed to operational risk through our outsourcing arrangements and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of our outsourcing vendors can have on our ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to our business such as certain loan processing functions for example breakdowns or failures of our vendors systems or employees could be a source of operational risk to us resulting losses from operational risk could take the form of explicit charges increased operational costs including remediation costs harm to our reputation inability to secure insurance litigation regulatory intervention or sanctions or foregone business opportunities our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security we rely heavily on communications information systems both internal and provided by third parties and the internet to conduct our business our business is dependent on our ability to process and monitor large numbers of daily transactions in compliance with legal regulatory and internal standards and specifications in addition a significant portion of our operations relies heavily on the secure processing storage and transmission of personal and confidential information such as the personal information of our customers and clients these risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase mobile payments and other internetbased product offerings expand our internal usage of webcloudbased products and applications and maintain and develop new relationships with third and fourth party providers in addition our ability to extend protections to customers information to individual customer devices is limited especially if the customers willingly provide third parties access to their devices or information in the event of a failure interruption or breach of our information systems or that of a third party that provides services to us or our customers we may be unable to avoid impact to our customers such a failure interruption or breach could result in legal liability remediation costs regulatory action or reputational harm other us financial service institutions and companies have reported breaches some severe in the security of their websites or other systems and several financial institutions including key experienced significant distributed denialofservice attacks some of which involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to disable or degrade service or sabotage systems other attacks have attempted to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information hold for ransom or alter or destroy data often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware phishing cyberattacks credential stuffing and other means to the extent that we use third parties to provide services to our clients we seek to minimize the risk by performing due diligence and monitoring the third party but we cannot control all of the risks at these third parties should an adverse event affecting another companys systems occur we may not have indemnification or other protection from the other company sufficient to fully compensate us or otherwise protect us or our clients from the consequences in addition our customers routinely use keyissued credit and debit cards to pay for transactions conducted with businesses in person and over the internet if the businesss systems that process or store debit or credit card information experience a security breach our card holders may experience fraud on their card accounts we may suffer losses associated with such fraudulent transactions as well as for other costs such as replacing impacted cards key also provides card transaction processing services to some merchant customers under agreements we have with payment networks such as mastercard under these agreements we may be responsible for certain losses and penalties if one of our merchant customers suffers a data breach we also face risks related to the increasing interdependence and interconnectivity of financial entities and technology systems a technology failure cyberattack or other security breach that significantly compromises the systems of one or more financial parties or service providers could have a material impact on counterparties or market participants including us any thirdparty technology failure cyberattack or security breach could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions service clients or otherwise operate our business to date none of these efforts have had a material adverse effect on our business or operations or resulted in any material disruption of our operations or material harm to our customers such security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sourcesmalicious actors including but not limited to persons who constitute an insider threat who are involved with organized crime or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments those same parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers or clients through social engineering phishing and other methods our security systems may not be able to protect our information systems from similar attacks due to the rapid evolution and creation of sophisticated cyberattacks we are also subject to the risk that a malicious actor or our employees may intercept andor transmit or otherwise misuse unauthorized confidential or proprietary information an interception misuse or mishandling of personal confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from a customer or third party could result in legal liability remediation costs regulatory action and reputational harm over the last few years several large companies have disclosed that they suffered substantial data security breaches compromising millions of user accounts and credentials to date our losses and costs related to these breaches have not been material but other similar events in the future could have a significant impact on us we have incurred and will continue to incur significant expense in an effort to improve the reliability of our systems and their security against external and internal threats nonetheless there remains the risk that one or more adverse events might occur if one does occur we might not be able to remediate the event or its consequences timely or adequately we rely on third parties to perform significant operational services for us third parties perform significant operational services on our behalf additionally some of our third parties outsource aspects of their operations to other third parties commonly referred to as fourth parties these parties are subject to similar risks as key relating to cybersecurity and breakdowns or failures of their own systems internal processes and controls or employees one or more of these third parties may experience a cybersecurity event or operational disruption and if any such event does occur it may not be adequately addressed either operationally or financially by such third party certain of these third parties may have limited indemnification obligations or may not have the financial capacity to satisfy their indemnification obligations financial or operational difficulties of a third party could also impair our operations if those difficulties interfere with such third partys ability to serve us additionally some of our outsourcing arrangements are located overseas and therefore are subject to risks unique to the regions in which they operate if a critical third party is unable to meet our needs in a timely manner or if the services or products provided by such third party are terminated or otherwise delayed and if we are not able to identify or develop alternative sources for these services and products quickly and costeffectively it could have a material adverse effect on our business additionally regulatory guidance adopted by federal banking regulators related to how banks select engage and manage their third parties affects the circumstances and conditions under which we work with third parties and the cost of managing such relationships we are subject to claims and litigation which could result in significant financial liability andor reputational risk from time to time customers vendors or other parties may make claims and take legal action against us we maintain reserves for certain claims when deemed appropriate based upon our assessment that a loss is probable estimable and consistent with applicable accounting guidance at any given time we have a variety of legal actions asserted against us in various stages of litigation resolution of a legal action can often take years whether any particular claims and legal actions are founded or unfounded if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in our favor they may result in significant financial liability and adversely affect how the market perceives us and our products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services we are also involved from time to time in other reviews investigations and proceedings both formal and informal by governmental and selfregulatory agencies regarding our business including among other things accounting compliance and operational matters certain of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief the number and risk of these investigations and proceedings has increased in recent years in the financial services industry due to legal changes to the consumer protection laws provided for by the doddfrank act and the creation of the cfpb there have also been a number of highly publicized legal claims against financial institutions involving fraud or misconduct by employees and we run the risk that employee misconduct could occur it is not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented and our methods of reducing risk exposure may not be effective we regularly review and update our internal controls disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures we also maintain an erm program designed to identify measure monitor report and analyze our risks additionally our internal audit function provides an independent assessment and testing of keys internal controls policies and procedures any system of controls and any system to reduce risk exposure however well designed operated and tested is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system are met the systems may not work as intended or be circumvented by employees third parties or others outside of key additionally instruments systems and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of market compliance credit liquidity operational and business risks and enterprisewide risk could be less effective than anticipated as a result we may not be able to effectively or fully mitigate our risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk climate change severe weather global pandemics natural disasters acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact our business natural disasters including severe weather events of increasing strength and frequency due to climate change acts of war or terrorism global pandemics and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business or upon third parties who perform operational services for us such events could affect the stability of our deposit base impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans impair the value of collateral securing loans cause significant property damage result in lost revenue or cause us to incur additional expenses additionally potential future shutdowns of portions of the federal government could negatively impact the financial performance of certain customers and could negatively impact customers future access to certain loan and guaranty programs iv liquidity risk capital and liquidity requirements imposed by the doddfrank act require banks and bhcs to maintain more and higher quality capital and more and higher quality liquid assets than has historically been the case evolving capital standards resulting from the doddfrank act and the regulatory capital rules adopted by our regulators have had and will continue to have a significant impact on banks and bhcs including key for a detailed explanation of the capital and liquidity rules that became effective for us on a phasedin basis on january see the section titled regulatory capital requirements under the heading supervision and regulation in item of this report the federal reserves capital standards require key to maintain more and higher quality capital and could limit our business activities including lending and our ability to expand organically or through acquisitions they could also result in our taking steps to increase our capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit our ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders in addition the liquidity standards require us to hold highquality liquid assets may require us to change our future mix of investment alternatives and may impact future business relationships with certain customers additionally support of liquidity standards may be satisfied through the use of term wholesale borrowings which tend to have a higher cost than that of traditional core deposits further the federal reserve requires bhcs to obtain approval before making a capital distribution such as paying or increasing dividends implementing common stock repurchase programs or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments the federal reserve has detailed the processes that bhcs should maintain to ensure they hold adequate capital under severely adverse conditions and have ready access to funding before engaging in any capital activities these rules could limit keys ability to make distributions including paying out dividends or buying back shares for more information see the section titled regulatory capital requirements under the heading supervision and regulation in item of this report recently certain regulatory rule changes related to tailoring outlined in egrrcpa have been finalized while marginal relief from certain capital and liquidity standards has been afforded to key such as relief from lcr compliance overall capital and liquidity management practices and expectations will remain unchanged for the foreseeable future moreover key does not anticipate significant changes to its overall liquidity and capital levels or composition as a result of the final rules finally additional guidance and rulemaking related to capital planning and stress testing have yet to be finalized and impacts resulting from these potential changes remain unknown federal agencies actions to ensure stability of the us financial system may have disruptive effects on us since the federal government has taken unprecedented steps to provide stability to and confidence in the financial markets for example the federal reserve initiated a round of interest rate cuts designed to maintain economic expansion in the future federal agencies may no longer support such initiatives the discontinuation of such initiatives may have unanticipated or unintended impacts perhaps severe on the financial markets these effects could include higher debt yields a flatter or steeper slope to the yield curve or unanticipated changes to quality spread premiums that may not follow historical relationships or patterns in addition new initiatives or legislation may not be implemented or if implemented may not be adequate to counter any negative effects of discontinuing programs or in the event of an economic downturn to support and stabilize the economy we rely on dividends by our subsidiaries for most of our funds we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our subsidiaries with the exception of cash that we may raise from debt and equity issuances we receive substantially all of our funding from dividends by our subsidiaries dividends by our subsidiaries are the principal source of funds for the dividends we pay on our common and preferred stock and interest and principal payments on our debt federal banking law and regulations limit the amount of dividends that keybank keycorps largest subsidiary can pay for further information on the regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by keybank see supervision and regulation in item of this report in the event keybank is unable to pay dividends to us we may not be able to service debt pay obligations or pay dividends on our common or preferred stock such a situation could result in key losing access to alternative wholesale funding sources in addition our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiarys liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiarys creditors we are subject to liquidity risk which could negatively affect our funding levels market conditions or other events could negatively affect our access to or the cost of funding affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations or fund asset growth and new business initiatives at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences although we maintain a liquid asset portfolio and have implemented strategies to maintain sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets liabilities and offbalance sheet commitments under various economic conditions including a reduced level of wholesale funding sources a substantial unexpected or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on us if the cost effectiveness or the availability of supply in these credit markets is reduced for a prolonged period of time our funding needs may require us to access funding and manage liquidity by other means these alternatives may include generating client deposits securitizing or selling loans extending the maturity of wholesale borrowings borrowing under certain secured borrowing arrangements using relationships developed with a variety of fixed income investors and further managing loan growth and investment opportunities these alternative means of funding may result in an increase to the overall cost of funds and may not be available under stressed conditions which would cause us to liquidate a portion of our liquid asset portfolio to meet any funding needs our credit ratings affect our liquidity position the rating agencies regularly evaluate the securities issued by keycorp and keybank the ratings of our longterm debt and other securities are based on a number of factors including our financial strength ability to generate earnings and other factors some of these factors are not entirely within our control such as conditions affecting the financial services industry and the economy and changes in rating methodologies changes in any of these factors could impact our ability to maintain our current credit ratings a rating downgrade of the securities of keycorp or keybank could adversely affect our access to liquidity and could significantly increase our cost of funds trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us reducing our ability to generate income v market risk a reversal of the us economic recovery and volatile or recessionary conditions in the us or abroad could negatively affect our business or our access to capital markets a worsening of economic and market conditions downside shocks or a return to recessionary economic conditions could result in adverse effects on key and others in the financial services industry the prolonged lowinterest rate environment despite a generally improving economy has presented a challenge for the industry including key and affects business and financial performance in particular we could face some of the following risks and other unforeseeable risks in connection with a downturn in the economic and market environment or in the face of downside shocks or a recession whether in the united states or internationally table start a loss of confidence in the financial services industry and the debt and equity markets by investors placing pressure on the price of keys common shares or decreasing the credit or liquidity available to key table endtable start a decrease in consumer and business confidence levels generally decreasing credit usage and investment or increasing delinquencies and defaults table endtable start a decrease in household or corporate incomes reducing demand for keys products and services table endtable start a decrease in the value of collateral securing loans to keys borrowers or a decrease in the quality of keys loan portfolio increasing loan chargeoffs and reducing keys net income table end table start a decrease in our ability to liquidate positions at acceptable market prices table endtable start the extended continuation of the current lowinterest rate environment continuing or increasing downward pressure to our net interest income table endtable start an increase in competition or consolidation in the financial services industry table endtable start increased concern over and scrutiny of the capital and liquidity levels of financial institutions generally and those of our transaction counterparties specifically table endtable start a decrease in confidence in the creditworthiness of the united states or other governments whose securities we hold and table endtable start an increase in limitations on or the regulation of financial services companies like key table end we are subject to interest rate risk which could adversely affect net interest income our earnings are largely dependent upon our net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interestearning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interestbearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control including general economic conditions the competitive environment within our markets consumer preferences for specific loan and deposit products and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies in particular the federal reserve changes in monetary policy including changes in interest rate controls being applied by the federal reserve could influence the amount of interest we receive on loans and securities the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits and the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities if the federal reserve raises interest rates and begins to reverse quantitative easing the behavior of national money market rate indices the correlation of consumer deposit rates to financial market interest rates and the setting of libor rates may not follow historical relationships which could influence net interest income and net interest margin moreover if the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings increases at a faster rate than the interest we receive on loans and other investments net interest income and therefore our earnings would be adversely affected conversely earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest we receive on loans and other investments falls more quickly than the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings uncertainty surrounding the transition from libor to an alternate reference rate may adversely affect our business on july the chief executive of the united kingdom financial conduct authority the authority which regulates libor announced that the authority intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor to the administrator of libor after a transition away from the widespread use of libor to alternative rates is expected to occur before the end of although no consensus exists at this time as to what benchmark rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to libor in the united states the alternative reference rates committee of the federal reserve and the federal reserve bank of new york started in may to publish the secured overnight finance rate sofr as an alternative to us dollar libor sofr is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight that is collateralized by us treasury securities while sofr is currently considered a likely alternative to libor issues remain as to its implementation accordingly whether sofr will become an accepted alternative to libor remains uncertain at this time it is not possible to predict the effect of the authoritys announcement or other regulatory changes or announcements any establishment of alternative reference rates or any other reforms to libor that may be enacted in the united kingdom the united states or elsewhere the uncertainty regarding the transition from libor to another benchmark rate or rates could have adverse impacts on floatingrate obligations loans deposits derivatives and other financial instruments that currently use libor as a benchmark rate and ultimately adversely affect keycorps financial condition and results of operations the adverse impact could take various forms and is dependent upon certain factors outside of our control such as timing of adoption by market forces of a new widely accepted libor replacement timing of libor cessation and counterparty acceptance of a new reference rate for both new and existing contracts among others additionally since libor and any replacement reference rate may have significantly different attributes it is difficult to predict the amount of increased costs associated with implementing the transition to a new reference rate including costs relative to product changes systems chang es compliance and operational oversight costs and legal expenses among others our profitability depends upon economic conditions in the geographic regions where we have significant operations and on certain market segments in which we conduct significant business we have concentrations of loans and other business activities in geographic regions where our bank branches are located washington oregonalaska rocky mountains indiananorthwest ohiomichigan centralsouthwest ohio east ohiowestern pennsylvania atlantic western new york eastern new york and new england and additional exposure to geographic regions outside of our branch footprint economic growth in the various regions where we operate has been uneven and the health of the overall us economy may differ from the economy of any particular geographic region adverse conditions in a geographic region such as inflation unemployment recession natural disasters or other factors beyond our control could impact the ability of borrowers in these regions to repay their loans decrease the value of collateral securing loans made in these regions or affect the ability of our customers in these regions to continue conducting business with us additionally a significant portion of our business activities are concentrated within the commercial real estate healthcare and utilities market segments the profitability of some of these market segments depends upon the health of the overall economy seasonality the impact of regulation and other factors that are beyond our control and may be beyond the control of our customers in these market segments an economic downturn in one or more geographic regions where we conduct our business or any significant or prolonged impact on the profitability of one or more of the market segments with which we conduct significant business activity could adversely affect the demand for our products and services the ability of our customers to repay loans the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties in the financial services industries and we routinely execute transactions with such counterparties including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships defaults by one or more financial services institutions have led to and may cause marketwide liquidity problems and losses many of our transactions with other financial institutions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty or client in addition our credit risk may be affected when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivatives exposure due us vi reputation risk damage to our reputation could significantly harm our businesses our ability to attract and retain customers clients investors and highlyskilled management and employees is affected by our reputation public perception of the financial services industry declined as a result of the great recession we face increased public and regulatory scrutiny resulting from the financial crisis and economic downturn significant harm to our reputation can also arise from other sources including employee misconduct actual or perceived unethical behavior litigation or regulatory outcomes failing to deliver minimum or required standards of service and quality compliance failures disclosure of confidential information significant or numerous failures interruptions or breaches of our information systems failure to meet external commitments and goals including financial and the activities of our clients customers and counterparties including vendors actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members or individuals in the industry may have a significant adverse effect on our reputation we could also suffer significant reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest management of potential conflicts of interests is complex as we expand our business activities through more numerous transactions obligations and interests with and among our clients the actual or perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with us which could adversely affect our businesses vii strategic risk we may not realize the expected benefits of our strategic initiatives our ability to compete depends on a number of factors including among others our ability to develop and successfully execute our strategic plans and initiatives our strategic priorities include growing profitably and maintaining financial strength effectively managing risk and reward engaging a highperforming talented and diverse workforce embracing the changes required by our clients and the marketplace and acquiring expanding and retaining targeted client relationships our inability to execute on or achieve the anticipated outcomes of our strategic priorities may affect how the market perceives us and could impede our growth and profitability we operate in a highly competitive industry we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of competitors some of which are larger and may have more financial resources than us our competitors primarily include national and superregional banks as well as smaller community banks within the various geographic regions in which we operate we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions including without limitation savings associations credit unions mortgage banking companies finance companies mutual funds insurance companies investment management firms investment banking firms brokerdealers and other local regional national and global financial services firms in addition technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks including large technology companies to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks we expect the competitive landscape of the financial services industry to become even more intense as a result of legislative regulatory structural and technological changes our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including our ability to develop and execute strategic plans and initiatives our ability to develop maintain and build longterm customer relationships based on quality service and competitive prices our ability to develop competitive products and technologies demanded by our customers while maintaining our high ethical standards and an effective compliance program and keeping our assets safe and sound our ability to attract retain and develop a highly competent employee workforce and industry and general economic trends increased competition in the financial services industry or our failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position which could adversely affect our growth and profitability maintaining or increasing our market share depends upon our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences while maintaining competitive prices the continuous widespread adoption of new technologies including internet services and mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets requires us to evaluate our product and service offerings to ensure they remain competitive our success depends in part on our ability to adapt our products and services as well as our distribution of them to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences new technologies have altered consumer behavior by allowing consumers to complete transactions such as paying bills or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks new products allow consumers to maintain funds in brokerage accounts or mutual funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries known as disintermediation could result in the loss of fee income as well as the loss of customer loans and deposits and related income generated from those products the increasing pressure from our competitors both bank and nonbank to keep pace and adopt new technologies and products and services requires us to incur substantial expense we may be unsuccessful in developing or introducing new products and services modifying our existing products and services adapting to changing consumer preferences and spending and saving habits achieving market acceptance or regulatory approval sufficiently developing or maintaining a loyal customer base or offering products and services at prices lower than the prices offered by our competitors these risks may affect our ability to achieve growth in our market share and could reduce both our revenue streams from certain products and services and our revenues from our net interest income we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people our success depends in large part on our ability to attract retain motivate and develop key people competition for the best people in most of our business activities is ongoing and can be intense and we may not be able to retain or hire the people we want or need to serve our customers additionally the profile of some of the people we target has changed significantly causing those with whom we compete for talent to also change and to include nonbanks and large technology companies to attract and retain qualified employees we must compensate these employees at market levels typically those levels have caused employee compensation to be our greatest expense our incentive compensation structure and sales practices are subject to review by our regulators who may identify deficiencies in the structure of or issue additional guidance on our compensation practices causing us to make changes that may affect our ability to offer competitive compensation to these individuals or that place us at a disadvantage to nonfinancial service competitors our ability to attract and retain talented employees may be affected by these developments or any new executive compensation limits and regulations acquisitions or strategic partnerships may disrupt our business and dilute shareholder value acquiring other banks bank branches or other businesses involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions or partnerships including exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the acquired company diversion of our managements time and attention significant integration risk with respect to employees accounting systems and technology platforms increased regulatory scrutiny and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired company we regularly evaluate merger and acquisition and strategic partnership opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions as a result mergers or acquisitions involving cash debt or equity securities may occur at any time acquisitions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values therefore some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share could occur in connection with any future transaction viii model risk we rely on quantitative models to manage certain accounting risk management capital planning and treasury functions we use quantitative models to help manage certain aspects of our business and to assist with certain business decisions including estimating incurred loan and lease losses measuring the fair value of financial instruments when reliable market prices are unavailable estimating the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations managing risk such as setting reserves and for capital planning purposes including during the capital stress testing process our modeling methodologies rely on many assumptions historical analyses correlations and being compatible to the available data these assumptions have certain limitations and may be incorrect particularly in times of market distress and the historical correlations on which we rely may no longer be relevant additionally as businesses and markets evolve our measurements may not accurately reflect this evolution even if the underlying assumptions and historical correlations used in our models are adequate our models may be deficient due to errors in computer code use of bad data during development or input into the model during model use or the use of a model for a purpose outside the scope of the models design as a result our models may not fully capture or express the risks we face may suggest that we have sufficient capital when we may not or may lead us to misjudge the business and economic environment in which we will operate if our models fail to produce reliable results on an ongoing basis we may not make appropriate risk management capital planning or other business or financial decisions furthermore strategies that we employ to manage and govern the risks associated with our use of models may not be effective or fully reliable and as a result we may realize losses or other lapses banking regulators continue to focus on the models used by banks and bank holding companies in their businesses the failure or inadequacy of a model may result in increased regulatory scrutiny on us or may result in an enforcement action or proceeding against us by one of our regulators
