services some of our competitors are larger and may have more financial resources while some of our competitors enjoy fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures the financial services industry has become more competitive as technology advances have lowered barriers to entry enabling more companies including nonbank companies to provide financial services technological

supervision and regulation the regulatory framework applicable to bhcs and banks is intended primarily to protect consumers the dif taxpayers and the banking system as a whole rather than to protect the security holders and creditors of financial services companies comprehensive reform of the legislative and regulatory environment for financial services companies occurred in and remains ongoing we cannot predict changes in applicable laws regulations or regulatory agency policies but any such changes may materially affect our business financial condition results of operations or access to liquidity or credit overview federal law establishes a system of regulation under which the federal reserve is the umbrella regulator for bhcs while their subsidiaries are principally regulated by prudential or functional regulators i the occ for national banks and federal savings associations ii the fdic for state nonmember banks and savings associations iii the federal reserve for state member banks iv the cfpb for consumer financial products or services v the sec and finra for securities brokerdealer activities vi the sec cftc and nfa for swaps and other derivatives and vii state insurance regulators for insurance activities certain specific activities including traditional bank trust and fiduciary activities may be conducted in a bank without the bank being deemed a broker or a dealer in securities for purposes of securities functional regulation under the bhca bhcs generally may not directly or indirectly own or control more than of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any bank without prior approval from the federal reserve in addition bhcs are generally prohibited from engaging in commercial or industrial activities however a bhc that satisfies certain requirements regarding management capital adequacy and community reinvestment act performance may elect to be treated as a financial holding company fhc for purposes of federal law and as a result may engage in a substantially broader scope of activities that are considered to be financial in nature or complementary to those activities keycorp has elected to be treated as a fhc and as such is authorized to engage in securities underwriting and dealing insurance agency and underwriting and merchant banking activities in addition the federal reserve has permitted fhcs like keycorp to engage in the following activities under the view that such activities are complementary to a financial activity physical commodities trading activities energy management services and energy tolling among others under federal law a bhc also must serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions by providing financial assistance in the event of financial distress this support may be required when the bhc does not have the resources to or would prefer not to provide it certain loans by a bhc to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits in and certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank in addition federal law provides that in the bankruptcy of a bhc any commitment by the bhc to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment the doddfrank act created the fsoc to overlay the us supervisory framework for bhcs insured depository institutions and other financial service providers by serving as a systemic risk oversight body specifically the fsoc is authorized to i identify risks to us financial stability that could arise from the material financial distress or failure or ongoing activities of large interconnected sifis or that could arise outside the financial services marketplace ii promote market discipline by eliminating expectations that the us government will shield shareholders creditors and counterparties from losses in the event of failure and iii respond to emerging threats to the stability of the us financial system the fsoc is responsible for facilitating regulatory coordination information collection and sharing designating nonbank financial companies for consolidated supervision by the federal reserve designating systemic financial market utilities and systemic payment clearing and settlement activities requiring prescribed risk management standards and heightened federal regulatory oversight recommending stricter standards for sifis and together with the federal reserve determining whether action should be taken to break up firms that pose a grave threat to us financial stability as a fhc keycorp is subject to regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve under the bhca our national bank subsidiaries and their subsidiaries are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the occ at december we operated one fullservice fdicinsured national bank subsidiary keybank and one national bank subsidiary that is limited to fiduciary activities the fdic also has certain more limited regulatory supervisory and examination authority over keybank and keycorp under the fdia and the doddfrank act we have other financial services subsidiaries that are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve as well as other state and federal regulatory agencies and selfregulatory organizations because keybank engages in derivative transactions in it provisionally registered as a swap dealer with the cftc and became a member of the nfa the selfregulatory organization for participants in the us derivatives industry our securities brokerage and asset management subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by the sec finra and state securities regulators and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the insurance regulatory authorities of the states in which they operate our other nonbank subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations of both the federal government and the various states in which they are authorized to do business regulatory capital requirements background keycorp and keybank are subject to regulatory capital requirements that are based largely on the work of an international group of supervisors known as the basel committee on banking supervision basel committee the basel committee is responsible for establishing international bank supervisory standards for implementation in member jurisdictions to enhance and align bank regulation on a global scale and to promote financial stability the regulatory capital framework developed by the basel committee and implemented in the united states is a predominately riskbased capital framework that establishes minimum capital requirements based on the amount of regulatory capital a banking organization maintains relative to the amount of its total assets adjusted to reflect credit risk riskweighted assets each banking organization subject to this regulatory capital framework is required to satisfy certain minimum riskbased capital measures eg a tier riskbased capital ratio requirement of tier capital to total riskweighted assets and in the united states a minimum leverage ratio requirement of tier capital to average total onbalance sheet assets which serves as a backstop to the riskbased measures a capital instrument is assigned to one of two tiers based on the relative strength and ability of that instrument to absorb credit losses on a going concern basis capital instruments with relatively robust lossabsorption capacity are assigned to tier while other capital instruments with relatively less lossabsorption capacity are assigned to tier a banking organizations total capital equals the sum of its tier and tier capital the basel committee also developed a market risk capital framework that also has been implemented in the united states to address the substantial exposure to market risk faced by banking organizations with significant trading activity and augment the credit riskbased capital requirements described above for example the minimum total riskbased capital ratio requirement for a banking organization subject to the market risk capital rule equals the ratio of the banking organizations total capital to the sum of its credit riskweighted assets and market riskweighted assets only keycorp is subject to the market risk capital rule as keybank does not engage in substantial trading activity basel iii to address deficiencies in the international regulatory capital standards identified during the global financial crisis in the basel committee released comprehensive revisions to the international regulatory capital framework commonly referred to as basel iii the basel iii revisions are designed to strengthen the quality and quantity of regulatory capital in part through the introduction of a common equity tier capital requirement provide more comprehensive and robust risk coverage particularly for securitization exposures equities and offbalance sheet positions and address procyclicality concerns through the implementation of capital buffers the basel committee also released a series of revisions to the market risk capital framework to address deficiencies identified during its initial implementation eg arbitrage opportunities between the credit riskbased and market risk capital rules and in connection with the global financial crisis in july the us banking agencies adopted a final rule to implement basel iii with an effective date of january and a multiyear transition period regulatory capital rules as of april the regulatory capital rules are fully phasedin for key consistent with the international framework the regulatory capital rules further restrict the type of instruments that may be recognized in tier and tier capital including the phase out of trust preferred securities from tier capital for bhcs above a certain asset threshold like keycorp establish a minimum common equity tier capital ratio requirement of and capital buffers to absorb losses during periods of financial stress while allowing an institution to provide credit intermediation as it would during a normal economic environment and refine several of the methodologies used for determining riskweighted assets the regulatory capital rules provide additional requirements for large banking organizations with over billion in total consolidated assets or billion in foreign exposure but those additional requirements do not apply to keycorp or keybank accordingly for purposes of the regulatory capital rules keycorp and keybank are treated as standardized approach banking organizations under the regulatory capital rules standardized approach banking organizations such as keycorp and keybank are required to meet the minimum capital and leverage ratios set forth in the following table at december keycorps ratios under the fully phasedin regulatory capital rules are set forth in the following table minimum capital ratios and keycorp ratios under regulatory capital rules table start ratios including stress capital buffer regulatory minimum requirement stress capital buffer b regulatory minimum with stress capital buffer keycorp december c common equity tier tier capital total capital leverage a na table end a as a standardized approach banking organization keycorp is not subject to the supplemental leverage ratio requirement which became effective january b stress capital buffer must consist of common equity tier capital as a standardized approach banking organization keycorp is not subject to the countercyclical capital buffer of up to imposed upon an advanced approaches banking organization under the regulatory capital rules c ratios reflect the fiveyear transition of cecl impacts on regulatory ratios revised prompt corrective action framework the federal prompt corrective action framework established under the fdia groups fdicinsured depository institutions into one of five prompt corrective action capital categories well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized in addition to implementing the basel iii capital framework in the us the regulatory capital rules also revised the prompt corrective action capital category threshold ratios applicable to fdicinsured depository institutions such as keybank with an effective date of january the revised prompt corrective action framework table below identifies the capital category threshold ratios for a well capitalized and an adequately capitalized institution under the prompt corrective action framework well capitalized and adequately capitalized capital category ratios under revised prompt corrective action framework table start prompt corrective action capital category ratio well capitalized a adequately capitalized common equity tier riskbased tier riskbased total riskbased tier leverage b table end a a well capitalized institution also must not be subject to any written agreement order or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure b as a standardized approach banking organization keybank is not subject to the supplemental leverage ratio requirement which became effective january we believe that as of december keybank consolidated satisfied the riskbased and leverage capital requirements necessary to be considered well capitalized for purposes of the revised prompt corrective action framework however investors should not regard this determination as a representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of keybank because the prompt corrective action framework is intended to serve a limited supervisory function moreover it is important to note that the prompt corrective action framework does not apply to bhcs like keycorp recent regulatory capitalrelated developments in december the basel committee released its final revisions to basel iii the revisions seek to restore credibility in the calculation of riskweighted assets rwas and improve the comparability of regulatory capital ratios across banking organizations by enhancing the robustness and risksensitivity of the standardized approach for credit risk credit valuation adjustment and operational risk constraining the use of internal models by placing limits on certain inputs used to calculate capital requirements under the internal ratingsbased approach for credit risk used by advanced approaches banking organizations and removing the ability to use an internal model for purposes of determining the capital charge for credit valuation adjustment cva risk and operational risk introducing a leverage ratio buffer to further limit the leverage of global systemicallyimportant banks and replacing the existing basel ii output floor with a more robust risksensitive floor based on the basel iii standardized approach the us federal banking agencies released a statement announcing their support for the basel committees efforts but cautioned that they will consider how to appropriately incorporate these revisions into the regulatory capital rules and that any proposed changes based on the basel committee revisions would be subject to noticeandcomment rulemaking in view of the prohibition under the doddfrank act on the use of credit ratings in federal regulation there is some uncertainty as to whether or how the agencies would implement the ratingsbased aspects of the basel committee revisions to basel iii as well as any other aspect of the basel committee revisions that permit the us agencies to exercise homecountry discretion for example due to differences in accounting or market practices and legal requirements subsequently in december the basel committee released an update to its pillar disclosure framework to more appropriately align it to the changes adopted under the basel committees final revisions to basel iii before any action is taken by the federal banking agencies with respect to the revised pillar disclosure framework the federal agencies must determine whether and to what extent they will implement the final revisions to basel iii released by the basel committee in december on july the federal banking agencies issued a final rule to simplify certain aspects of the regulatory capital rules for standardized approach banking organizations including key the final rule simplifies for these banking organizations the regulatory capital requirements for mortgage servicing assets certain deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions the final rule replaces multiple deduction thresholds with a single deduction threshold for each of these categories and requires that a risk weight be applied to mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital the final rule also simplifies the calculation of the amount of capital issued by a consolidated subsidiary of a banking organization and held by third parties that is includable in regulatory capital in addition the final rule makes certain technical amendments to the regulatory capital rules that are applicable to standardized approach banking organizations as well as advanced approaches banking organizations the final rule provided an effective date of october for the technical amendments and an effective date of april for the simplification changes on november the federal banking agencies published an amendment to the final rule to provide standardized approach banking organizations with the option to implement the simplification changes on either january or april we chose to implement the simplification changes on april in november the federal banking agencies adopted a final rule to amend the regulatory capital rules by revising the definition of a high volatility commercial real estate hvcre exposure hvcre exposures are subject to a heightened risk weight under the regulatory capital rules the final rule which became effective on april conforms the hvcre definition to statutory changes enacted in may the final rule also clarifies the treatment under the revised hvcre definition of credit facilities that finance onetofour family residential properties as well as credit facilities that finance the development of land a final rule adopted by the federal banking agencies in february provides banking organizations with the option to phase in over a threeyear period the adverse dayone regulatory capital effects of the adoption of the cecl accounting standard on march the federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule that gives banking organizations that are required under us accounting standards to adopt cecl before the end of the option to delay for two years cecls adverse effects on regulatory capital cecl interim final rule this is in addition to the threeyear transition period already in place resulting in an optional fiveyear transition the agencies noted that this relief is being provided in order to allow banking organizations to better focus on lending to creditworthy households and businesses affected by recent strains on the us economy caused by covid19 the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act enacted on march provides banking organizations with the option to not comply with cecl until the earlier of i the termination date of the national emergency concerning covid19 declared by the president under the national emergencies act or ii december the federal banking agencies issued a statement on march indicating that banking organizations that elect to use the optional temporary statutory relief will be able to elect the remaining period of regulatory capital relief provided under the cecl interim final rule after the end of the statutory relief period alternatively banking organizations may adopt cecl as planned in and use the regulatory capital relief provided under the cecl interim final rule starting at the time of their adoption of cecl on august the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that is substantially similar to the cecl interim final rule like the cecl interim final rule the final rule gives eligible banking organizations the option to mitigate the estimated adverse effects on regulatory capital of cecl for two years followed by a threeyear transition period which results in an optional fiveyear transition the final rule expands the group of institutions eligible for this optional fiveyear transition to include any institution adopting cecl in the final rule also includes certain minor adjustments to clarify the calculation of the transitional amount key elected to adopt cecl as planned in the first quarter of and exercise the option to use a fiveyear transition to measure cecls effects on regulatory capital liquidity requirements us banking organizations are subject to regulatory liquidity requirements based on international liquidity standards established by the basel committee in and subsequently revised between and as revised the basel iii liquidity framework the basel iii liquidity framework establishes quantitative standards designed to ensure that a banking organization is appropriately positioned from a balance sheet perspective to satisfy its short and longterm funding needs to address shortterm liquidity risk the basel iii liquidity framework established a liquidity coverage ratio basel iii lcr calculated as the ratio of a banking organizations highquality liquid assets to its total net cash outflows over consecutive calendar days in addition to address longterm liquidity risk the basel iii liquidity framework established a net stable funding ratio basel iii nsfr calculated as the ratio of the amount of stable funding available to a banking organization to its required amount of stable funding in october the federal banking agencies published a final rule to implement the basel iii lcr for us banking organizations the liquidity coverage rules consistent with the basel iii lcr the us liquidity coverage rules established a minimum lcr for certain internationally active bank and nonbank financial companies excluding keycorp and a modified version of the lcr modified lcr for bhcs and other depository institution holding companies with over billion in consolidated assets that are not internationally active including keycorp under the liquidity coverage rules keycorp was required to calculate a modified lcr on a monthly basis and was required to satisfy a minimum modified lcr requirement of keybank was not subject to the lcr or the modified lcr under the liquidity coverage rules in december the federal reserve adopted a final rule to implement public disclosure requirements for the lcr and modified lcr under the final rule each calendar quarter keycorp was required to publicly disclose certain quantitative information regarding its modified lcr calculation together with a discussion of the factors that have a significant effect on its modified lcr keycorp began complying with these disclosure requirements for the calendar quarter beginning october large bhcs like keycorp are also subject to liquidity requirements contained in regulations adopted pursuant to the doddfrank act and the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act egrrcpa as enacted in the doddfrank act required the federal reserve to impose enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements collectively epss including enhanced liquidity standards upon bhcs like keycorp with at least billion in total consolidated assets in march the federal reserve published a final rule to implement certain of the epss required under the doddfrank act including liquidity requirements relating to cash flow projections a contingency funding plan liquidity risk limits the monitoring of liquidity risks with respect to collateral legal entities currencies business lines and intraday exposures liquidity stress testing a liquidity buffer and liquidity risk management requirements including requirements that apply to the board of directors the risk committee senior management and the independent review function keycorp was required to comply with the final rule starting on january egrrcpa enacted on may raised the asset threshold above which the federal reserve is required to apply epss to bhcs from billion to billion egrrcpa gave the federal reserve the authority following notice and comment procedures to continue to apply epss to any bhcs having at least billion but less than billion in total consolidated assets like keycorp if it determines that the application of the eps is appropriate to prevent or mitigate risks to financial stability or to promote the safety and soundness of the bhc or bhcs taking into consideration the bhcs or bhcs capital structure riskiness complexity financial activities size and other relevant factors in october the federal banking agencies issued two final rules related to the implementation of egrrcpa tailoring rules the final rules established four riskbased categories of banking organizations with billion or more in total consolidated assets and applied tailored regulatory requirements to each respective category based on keys analysis of the tailoring rules keycorp falls within the least restrictive of those categories category iv firms the tailoring rules became effective on december in one of the tailoring rules the federal banking agencies amended various rules including the rules governing standardized liquidity requirements thereby applying tailored liquidity requirements to large banking organizations in each of the four riskbased categories of institutions described in the tailoring rules under this final rule category iv firms with weighted shortterm wholesale funding of less than billion will not be subject to a reduced lcr keycorp believes that it does not meet the billion threshold and that it will not be subject to the reduced lcr thus as of december keycorp is no longer subject to an lcr requirement or an lcr public disclosure requirement in the other tailoring rule the federal reserve amended certain of its rules governing epss to apply tailored regulatory standards including liquidity standards to large bhcs in each of the four riskbased categories of institutions described in the tailoring rules under this rule category iv firms like keycorp are required to conduct internal liquidity stress tests quarterly rather than monthly as was previously the case and are subject to simplified liquidity risk management requirements including requirements to adopt a set of liquidity risk limits that is more limited than previously required calculate collateral positions monthly rather than weekly and monitor fewer elements of intraday liquidity risk exposures category iv firms are still required to maintain a liquidity buffer that is sufficient to meet the projected net stressed cashflow need over a 30day planning horizon under the firms internal liquidity stress test and remain subject to monthly tailored fr liquidity reporting requirements on october the federal banking agencies adopted a final rule to implement the basel iii nsfr for us banking organizations the nsfr final rule which is effective on july requires certain banking organizations with more than billion in total assets to maintain minimum amounts of stable funding to support their assets commitments and derivatives exposures over a oneyear time horizon the final nsfr rule tailors the application of the nsfr requirement to large banking organizations in each of the four riskbased categories of institutions established by the tailoring rules key is a category iv firm category iv firms with average weighted shortterm wholesale funding of less than billion will not be subject to an nsfr requirement key believes that it does not meet the billion threshold and that it will not be subject to an nsfr requirement capital planning and stress testing the federal reserves capital plan rule requires each usdomiciled toptier bhc with total consolidated assets of at least billion like keycorp to develop and maintain a written capital plan supported by a robust internal capital adequacy process the capital plan must be submitted to the federal reserve for supervisory review in connection with the bhcs ccar described below the supervisory review includes an assessment of many factors including keycorps ability to maintain capital above each minimum regulatory capital ratio on a pro forma basis under expected and stressful conditions throughout the planning horizon the federal reserves ccar is an intensive assessment of the capital adequacy of large us bhcs and of the practices these bhcs use to assess their capital needs the federal reserve expects bhcs subject to ccar to have and maintain regulatory capital in an amount that is sufficient to withstand a severely adverse operating environment and at the same time be able to continue operations maintain ready access to funding meet obligations to creditors and counterparties and provide credit intermediation the federal reserve conducted a supervisory stress test on keycorp pursuant to which the federal reserve projects revenue expenses losses and resulting poststress capital levels and regulatory capital ratios under conditions that affect the us economy or the financial condition of keycorp including supervisory baseline and severely adverse scenarios and through an adverse scenario that are determined by the federal reserve keycorp and keybank have also been required to conduct their own companyrun stress tests to assess the impact of stress scenarios including supervisorprovided baseline adverse and severely adverse scenarios and for keycorp one keycorpdefined baseline scenario and at least one keycorpdefined stress scenario on their consolidated earnings losses and capital over a ninequarter planning horizon taking into account their current condition risks exposures strategies and activities while keybank has only had to conduct an annual stress test keycorp has had to conduct both an annual and a midcycle stress test keycorp and keybank have been required to report the results of their annual stress tests to the federal reserve and the occ keycorp has been required to report the results of its midcycle stress test to the federal reserve summaries of the results of these companyrun stress tests have been disclosed under the regulatory disclosures filings section of the financials tab of keys investor relations website httpwwwkeycomir one of the tailoring rules issued by the federal reserve in october to implement egrrcpa changes the stress testing requirements applicable to bhcs that are category iv firms like keycorp under this rule category iv firms will no longer be required to conduct and publicly disclose the results of companyrun stress tests and will be subject to a supervisory stress test conducted by the federal reserve every other year rather than every year as has been the case in keycorp was required to participate in the federal reserves ccar process and was subject to a supervisory stress test conducted by the federal reserve a separate rule was issued by the federal banking agencies in october to implement a provision in egrrcpa that raised the asset threshold that triggers the requirement for federallyregulated banks to conduct companyrun stress tests on an annual basis from billion to billion in total consolidated assets under this final rule federallyregulated banks with total assets of less than billion like keybank will no longer be required to conduct annual companyrun stress tests also this final rule removes the adverse scenario as a required scenario for all stress testing requirements applicable to bhcs and federallyregulated banks so that such stress tests will be required to include only baseline and severely adverse scenarios on march the federal reserve adopted a final rule integrating certain aspects of the federal reserves regulatory capital rules with ccar and the stress test rules in order to simplify the overall capital framework that is currently applicable to bhcs that have billion or more in total consolidated assets including keycorp under the final rule the federal reserve amended the capital conservation buffer requirement under the regulatory capital rules by replacing the static riskweighted assets component of the buffer with a new measure the stress capital buffer which will be based on the results of an individual bhcs supervisory stress test and cannot be less than percent of riskweighted assets a firm will be subject to limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments if it does not satisfy all minimum capital requirements and its stress capital buffer requirement a firms stress capital buffer requirement will become effective on october of each year and will remain in effect until september of the following year unless the firm receives an updated stress capital buffer requirement from the federal reserve on march the federal banking agencies published an interim final rule that revises the definition of eligible retained income as that term is used in the agencies regulatory capital rules the revised definition applies to all buffer requirements applicable to a banking organization including the stress capital buffer requirement adopted by the federal reserve on march the revised definition of eligible retained income will make any automatic limitations on capital distributions that could apply under the agencies capital rules more gradual with the objective of promoting continued lending during a period of stress including the period of stress resulting from the covid19 pandemic on august the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that adopts without change the interim final rule issued in march that revises the definition of eligible retained income as that term is used in the agencies regulatory capital rules in april we submitted our capital plan to the federal reserve under the federal reserves ccar process on june the federal reserve publicly announced the results of its ccar process and the supervisory stress test that it conducted of bhcs having more than billion in total consolidated assets including keycorp the federal reserve indicated that it planned to use the results of this stress test to set the new stress capital buffer requirement for these firms which would take effect in the fourth quarter of the federal reserve also announced the results of a sensitivity analysis it conducted to assess the resiliency of these firms under three hypothetical downside scenarios which could result from the covid19 disruptions because of the results of its sensitivity analysis the federal reserve decided to take certain actions to require large banking organizations to preserve capital and reevaluate their capital plans specifically the federal reserve stated that it was requiring each firm subject to its capital plan rule to update and resubmit its capital plan to the appropriate reserve bank within days after the federal reserve provides updated scenarios the federal reserve further indicated that for the third quarter of these firms were prohibited from i making share repurchases other than share repurchases relating to issuances of common stock for employee stock ownership plans and ii paying common stock dividends that exceed the amount paid in the second quarter of or exceed an amount equal to the average of the firms net income for the four preceding calendar quarters unless otherwise specified by the federal reserve the federal reserve said that it may extend these restrictions quarterbyquarter depending upon the economic circumstances on june keycorp announced that its preliminary stress capital requirement provided by the federal reserve as part of the federal reserve capital stress testing exercise is which represents the minimum buffer required for banking organizations the size of key keycorp also announced that its capital plans included maintaining its common stock dividend for the third quarter of at the same level as the second quarter of subject to approval by keycorps board of directors which the board subsequently approved on july on august the federal reserve confirmed keycorps stress capital requirement of on september the federal reserve announced three supervisory scenarios baseline severely adverse and alternative severe that firms subject to the federal reserves capital plan rule must use in preparing their updated capital plan resubmissions and that the federal reserve would use in conducting its updated stress analyses of these firms the federal reserve stated that it planned to release firmspecific results from the firms performance under these scenarios by the end of due to the continued economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic the federal reserve announced on september that it was extending for an additional quarter certain measures to ensure that large banking organizations maintain a high level of capital resilience specifically the federal reserve stated that banking organizations with more than billion in total assets would be subject to the same prohibition on share repurchases and limitation on dividend payments for the fourth quarter of that they were subject to for the third quarter of on december the federal reserve announced the results of the second round of stress tests for that it conducted on large banking organizations including keycorp the federal reserve indicated that in the aggregate capital ratios for the firms subject to the stress tests remained well above their required minimum levels throughout the projection horizon under both the severely adverse and alternative severe scenarios however the federal reserve stated that because of the ongoing economic uncertainty it was extending its limits on capital distributions by these banking organizations into the first quarter of with certain modifications the federal reserve said that these firms including keycorp are prohibited from increasing their common stock dividends to an amount greater than the amount paid in the second quarter of and are prohibited from paying common stock dividends and making share repurchases that in the aggregate exceed an amount equal to the average of the firms net income for the four preceding calendar quarters the federal reserve further indicated that it may extend these restrictions beyond the first quarter of and that it was extending the time period to notify firms whether their stress capital buffer requirements will be recalculated until march on january the federal reserve issued a final rule to make conforming changes to the capital planning regulatory reporting and stress capital buffer requirements for firms subject to category iv standards including keycorp to make these requirements consistent with the tailored regulatory framework for large banking organizations that the federal reserve adopted in an october rulemaking the final rule revises the elements of the capital plan that category iv firms are required to submit to the federal reserve and makes related changes to regulatory reporting requirements also the final rule updates the frequency for calculating the stress capital buffer for these firms in addition the final rule makes certain clarifying changes to the stress testing rules applicable to all large banking organizations dividend restrictions federal law and regulation impose limitations on the payment of dividends by our national bank subsidiaries like keybank historically dividends paid by keybank have been an important source of cash flow for keycorp to pay dividends on its equity securities and interest on its debt dividends by our national bank subsidiaries are limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under an earnings retention test and an undivided profits test under the earnings retention test without the prior approval of the occ a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current years net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years under the undivided profits test a dividend may not be paid in excess of a banks undivided profits moreover under the fdia an insured depository institution may not pay a dividend if the payment would cause it to be less than adequately capitalized under the prompt corrective action framework or if the institution is in default in the payment of an assessment due to the fdic similarly under the regulatory capital rules a banking organization that fails to satisfy the minimum capital conservation buffer requirement will be subject to certain limitations which include restrictions on capital distributions large banking organizations are subject to additional restrictions on capital distributions imposed by the federal reserve because of economic uncertainty caused by the covid19 pandemic for more information on these restrictions please see the section above entitled regulatory capital requirements capital planning and stress testing and for more information about the payment of dividends by keybank to keycorp please see note restrictions on cash dividends and lending activities in this report fdia resolution authority and financial stability deposit insurance and assessments the dif provides insurance coverage for domestic deposits funded through assessments on insured depository institutions like keybank the amount of deposit insurance coverage for each depositors deposits is per depository the fdic must assess the premium based on an insured depository institutions assessment base calculated as its average consolidated total assets minus its average tangible equity keybanks current annualized premium assessments can range from to for each of its assessment base the rate charged depends on keybanks performance on the fdics large and highly complex institution riskassessment scorecard which includes factors such as keybanks regulatory rating its ability to withstand asset and fundingrelated stress and the relative magnitude of potential losses to the fdic in the event of keybanks failure in december the fdic issued a final rule that imposes recordkeeping requirements on insured depository institutions with two million or more deposit accounts including keybank to facilitate rapid payment of insured deposits to customers if such an institution were to fail the rule requires those insured depository institutions to i maintain complete and accurate data on each depositors ownership interest by right and capacity for all of the institutions deposit accounts and ii develop the capability to calculate the insured and uninsured amounts for each deposit owner within hours of failure the fdic will conduct periodic testing of compliance with these requirements and institutions subject to the rule must submit to the fdic a certification of compliance signed by the banks ceo and deposit insurance coverage summary report on or before the mandatory compliance date and annually thereafter the final rule became effective on april with a mandatory compliance date of april on july the fdic approved amendments that revise certain aspects of this rule among other things the amendments to this rule i provide covered institutions with the option to extend the compliance date to no later than april upon notification to the fdic ii clarify the certification requirement iii revise the actions that must be taken for deposit accounts insured on a passthrough basis where the banks account holder is holding funds on behalf of the beneficial owners of the funds and iv streamline the process for submitting exception requests to the fdic conservatorship and receivership of insured depository institutions upon the insolvency of an insured depository institution the fdic will be appointed as receiver or in rare circumstances conservator for the insolvent institution under the fdia in an insolvency the fdic may repudiate or disaffirm any contract to which the institution is a party if the fdic determines that performance of the contract would be burdensome and that disaffirming or repudiating the contract would promote orderly administration of the institutions affairs if the contractual counterparty made a claim against the receivership or conservatorship for breach of contract the amount paid to the counterparty would depend upon among other factors the receivership or conservatorship assets available to pay the claim and the priority of the claim relative to others in addition the fdic may enforce most contracts entered into by the insolvent institution notwithstanding any provision that would terminate cause a default accelerate or give other rights under the contract solely because of the insolvency the appointment of the receiver or conservator or the exercise of rights or powers by the receiver or conservator the fdic may also transfer any asset or liability of the insolvent institution without obtaining approval or consent from the institutions shareholders or creditors these provisions would apply to obligations and liabilities of keycorps insured depository institution subsidiaries such as keybank including obligations under senior or subordinated debt issued to public investors receivership of certain sifis the doddfrank act created a new resolution regime as an alternative to bankruptcy known as the orderly liquidation authority ola for certain sifis including bhcs and their affiliates under the ola the fdic would generally be appointed as receiver to liquidate and wind down a failing sifi the determination that a sifi should be placed into ola receivership is made by the us treasury secretary who must conclude that the sifi is in default or in danger of default and that the sifis failure poses a risk to the stability of the us financial system this determination must come after supermajority recommendations by the federal reserve and the fdic and consultation between the us treasury secretary and the president if the fdic is appointed as receiver under the ola its powers and the rights and obligations of creditors and other relevant parties would be determined exclusively under the ola the powers of a receiver under the ola are generally based on the fdics powers as receiver for insured depository institutions under the fdia certain provisions of the ola were modified to reduce disparate treatment of creditors claims between the us bankruptcy code and the ola however substantial differences between the two regimes remain including the fdics right to disregard claim priority in some circumstances the use of an administrative claims procedure under ola to determine creditors claims rather than a judicial procedure in bankruptcy the fdics right to transfer claims to a bridge entity and limitations on the ability of creditors to enforce contractual crossdefaults against potentially viable affiliates of the entity in receivership ola liquidity would be provided through credit support from the us treasury and assessments made first on claimants against the receivership that received more in the ola resolution than they would have received in ordinary liquidation to the full extent of the excess and second if necessary on sifis like keycorp utilizing a riskbased methodology in december the fdic published a notice for comment regarding its single point of entry resolution strategy under the ola this strategy involves the appointment of the fdic as receiver for the sifis toplevel us holding company only while permitting the operating subsidiaries of the failed holding company to continue operations uninterrupted as receiver the fdic would establish a bridge financial company for the failed holding company and would transfer the assets and a very limited set of liabilities of the receivership estate the claims of unsecured creditors and other claimants in the receivership would be satisfied by the exchange of their claims for the securities of one or more new holding companies emerging from the bridge company the fdic has not taken any subsequent regulatory action relating to this resolution strategy under ola since the comment period ended in march depositor preference the fdia provides that in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution the claims of its depositors including claims of its depositors that have subrogated to the fdic and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as receiver have priority over other general unsecured claims if an insured depository institution fails insured and uninsured depositors along with the fdic will be placed ahead of unsecured nondeposit creditors including the institutions parent bhc and subordinated creditors in order of priority of payment resolution plans bhcs with at least billion in total consolidated assets like keycorp have been required to periodically submit to the federal reserve and fdic a plan discussing how the company could be rapidly and orderly resolved if the company failed or experienced material financial distress insured depository institutions with at least billion in total consolidated assets like keybank have also been required to submit a resolution plan to the fdic these plans have been due annually unless the requirement to submit the plans was deferred by the regulators the federal reserve and fdic make available on their websites the public sections of resolution plans for the companies including keycorp and keybank that submitted plans the public sections of the resolution plans of keycorp and keybank are available at httpwwwfederalreservegovsupervisionregresolutionplanshtm and httpswwwfdicgovregulationsreformresplans in october the federal reserve and fdic adopted a final rule to modify the resolution planning requirements applicable to large bhcs under this final rule bhcs with less than billion in total consolidated assets will no longer be required to submit a resolution plan unless they have billion or more in certain riskbased indicators under this final rule keycorp is no longer subject to resolution planning requirements on april the fdic issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking anpr requesting public comment on potential changes to its rule imposing resolution planning requirements on large insured depository institutions including potential modifications to the rule in the following areas i creation of tiered resolution planning requirements based on institution size complexity and other factors ii revisions to the frequency and required content of plan submissions including elimination of plan submissions for a category of smaller and less complex institutions iii improvements to the process for periodic engagements between the fdic and institutions on resolutionrelated matters and iv revision of the billion asset threshold in the current rule the fdic indicated that it is considering two alternate approaches with respect to the tiering of resolution plan requirements under each of these approaches institutions would be placed into three groups with the first two groups required to submit resolution plans with streamlined content requirements and the third group not required to submit a resolution plan the fdic would engage with institutions in all three groups on a periodic basis on a limited number of items related to resolution planning and would conduct periodic testing of the resolution planning capabilities of these institutions comments on this anpr were due by june any changes to this rule will impact keybank the fdic extended the due date for the next resolution plan submission for all institutions until after the rulemaking is completed on january the fdic issued a statement announcing that it will resume requiring insured depository institutions with billion or more in assets to submit resolution plans the fdic said that it intends to streamline resolution plan content requirements and emphasize periodic engagement with firms regarding resolution planning issues the fdic further indicated that no firm will be required to submit a plan without at least twelve months advance notice being provided to the firm other regulatory developments the bank secrecy act the bsa requires all financial institutions including banks and securities brokerdealers to among other things maintain a riskbased system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism it includes a variety of recordkeeping and reporting requirements such as cash and suspicious activity reporting as well as due diligence and knowyourcustomer documentation requirements key has established and maintains an antimoney laundering program to comply with the bsas requirements consumer financial protection bureau title x of the doddfrank act created the cfpb a consumer financial services regulator with supervisory authority over banks and their affiliates with assets of more than billion like key to carry out federal consumer protection laws the cfpb also regulates financial products and services sold to consumers and has rulemaking authority with respect to federal consumer financial laws any new regulatory requirements promulgated by the cfpb or modifications in the interpretations of existing regulations could require changes to keys consumerfacing businesses the doddfrank act also gives the cfpb broad data collecting powers for fair lending for both small business and mortgage loans as well as extensive authority to prevent unfair deceptive and abusive practices volcker rule the volcker rule implements section of the doddfrank act which prohibits banking entities such as keycorp keybank and their affiliates and subsidiaries from owning sponsoring or having certain relationships with hedge funds and private equity funds referred to as covered funds and engaging in shortterm proprietary trading of financial instruments including securities derivatives commodity futures and options on these instruments the volcker rule excepts certain transactions from the general prohibition against proprietary trading including transactions in government securities eg us treasuries or any instruments issued by the gnma fnma fhlmc a federal home loan bank or any state or a political division of any state among others transactions in connection with underwriting or marketmaking activities and transactions as a fiduciary on behalf of customers a banking entity may also engage in riskmitigating hedging activity if it can demonstrate that the hedge reduces or mitigates a specific identifiable risk or aggregate risk position of the entity the banking entity is required to conduct an analysis supporting its hedging strategy and the effectiveness of the hedges must be monitored and if necessary adjusted on an ongoing basis although the volcker rule became effective on april the federal reserve exercised its unilateral authority to extend the compliance deadline until july with respect to covered funds in addition on december the federal reserve released additional guidelines regarding how banking entities may seek an extension of the conformance period for certain legacy covered fund investments under the doddfrank act the federal reserve is authorized to provide a banking entity up to an additional five years to conform legacy investments ie contractual commitments of a banking organization on or before may to make an investment in illiquid covered funds key does not anticipate that the proprietary trading restrictions in the volcker rule will have a material impact on its business but it may be required to divest certain fund investments as discussed in more detail in note fair value measurements in item of this report on january key filed for an additional extension for illiquid funds to retain certain indirect investments until the earlier of the date on which the investments are conformed or are expected to mature or july the application for an extension was approved on february as of december we have not committed to a plan to sell these investments therefore these investments continue to be valued using the net asset value per share methodology on october five federal agencies announced their adoption of a final rule to simplify and tailor requirements relating to the volcker rule among other things the final rule i revises the definition of certain terms relevant in determining the scope of the volcker rule ii modifies the eligibility criteria for a banking entity to be able to rely on certain exemptions and exclusions from the proprietary trading and covered fund prohibitions iii adds additional proprietary trading exclusions and iv tailors the rules compliance requirements based on the size of a firms trading assets and liabilities under the final rule a banking entity is subject to the most stringent compliance requirements if it has significant trading assets and liabilities that is total consolidated trading assets and liabilities of at least billion a banking entity with total consolidated trading assets and liabilities between billion and billion is regarded as having moderate trading assets and liabilities and is subject to a requirement to have a simplified compliance program that must be appropriate given that banking entitys activities size scope and complexity a presumption of compliance applies to a banking entity with limited trading assets and liabilities that is total consolidated trading assets and liabilities of less than billion the final rule rule became effective on january and the compliance date was january key believes that it will be regarded as having moderate trading assets and liabilities as calculated under the final rule we do not expect the final rule to have a material impact on key on june five federal agencies announced their adoption of a final rule to clarify and streamline the covered fundrelated provisions of the volcker rule among other things the final rule i permits certain lowrisk transactions including intraday credit riskless principal and payment clearing and settlement transactions between a banking entity and covered funds for which the banking entity serves as the investment adviser investment manager or sponsor ii clarifies exclusions from the covered fund definition for foreign public funds loan securitizations small business investment companies and public welfare investment funds and iii permits banking entities to invest in or sponsor certain types of funds that do not raise the concerns that the volcker rule was intended to address such as credit funds venture capital funds customer facilitation funds and family wealth management vehicles the final rule became effective on october enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements as enacted in the doddfrank act required the federal reserve to impose epss upon bhcs like keycorp with at least billion in total consolidated assets prudential standards were required to include enhanced riskbased capital requirements and leverage limits liquidity requirements riskmanagement and risk committee requirements resolution plan requirements credit exposure report requirements single counterparty credit limits sccl supervisory and companyrun stress test requirements and for certain financial companies a debttoequity limit early remediation requirements were required to include limits on capital distributions acquisitions and asset growth in early stages of financial decline and capital restoration plans capital raising requirements limits on transactions with affiliates management changes and asset sales in later stages of financial decline which would be triggered by forwardlooking indicators including regulatory capital and liquidity measures the resolution plan requirements were implemented by a joint final rule adopted by the federal reserve and fdic in and were revised by a joint final rule adopted by the federal reserve and fdic in in the federal reserve also issued a proposal to implement the stress test early remediation and sccl requirements however when that proposal was adopted as a final rule in it included only the stress test requirements and not the sccl or early remediation requirements in march the federal reserve published a final rule to implement certain of the epss required under the doddfrank act including i the incorporation of the regulatory capital rules through the federal reserves previously finalized rules on capital planning and stress tests ii liquidity requirements iii the risk management framework the risk committee and the chief risk officer as well as the corporate governance requirements as they relate to liquidity risk management and iv a 15to1 debttoequity limit for companies that the fsoc determines pose a grave threat to us financial stability keycorp was required to comply with the final rule starting on january egrrcpa which was enacted on may raised from billion to billion the asset threshold above which the federal reserve is required to apply epss to bhcs egrrcpa gave the federal reserve the authority following notice and comment procedures to continue to apply epss to any bhcs having at least billion but less than billion in total consolidated assets like keycorp also this statute requires the federal reserve to continue to conduct periodic stress tests of bhcs with assets between billion and billion like keycorp and the requirement for a publicly traded bhc to have a risk committee continues to apply if a bhc has assets of at least billion on june the federal reserve issued a final rule establishing sccl requirements for bhcs with billion or more in total consolidated assets the final rule does not apply to keycorp the federal reserve has taken no further action on the early remediation requirements proposed in in one of the tailoring rules issued in october to implement egrrcpa the federal reserve amended certain of its rules governing epss to apply tailored regulatory standards to large bhcs in each of the four riskbased categories of institutions described in the tailoring rules based on keys analysis of the tailoring rules keycorp believes that it is a category iv firm the least restrictive of these categories the tailoring rules are discussed further under the headings regulatory capital requirements liquidity requirements and regulatory capital requirements capital planning and stress testing bank transactions with affiliates federal banking law and regulation imposes qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain transactions by a bank with its affiliates including the banks parent bhc and certain companies the parent bhc may be deemed to control for these purposes transactions covered by these provisions must be on armslength terms and cannot exceed certain amounts that are determined with reference to the banks regulatory capital moreover if the transaction is a loan or other extension of credit it must be secured by collateral in an amount and quality expressly prescribed by statute and if the affiliate is unable to pledge sufficient collateral the bhc may be required to provide it these provisions significantly restrict the ability of keybank to fund its affiliates including keycorp kbcm and keycorps nonbanking subsidiaries engaged in making merchant banking investments and certain companies in which these subsidiaries have invested provisions added by the doddfrank act expanded the scope of i the definition of affiliate to include any investment fund having any bank or bhcaffiliated company as an investment adviser ii credit exposures subject to the prohibition on the acceptance of lowquality assets or securities issued by an affiliate as collateral the quantitative limits and the collateralization requirements to now include credit exposures arising out of derivative repurchase agreement and securities lendingborrowing transactions and iii transactions subject to quantitative limits to now also include credit collateralized by affiliateissued debt obligations that are not securities in addition these provisions require that a credit extension to an affiliate remain secured in accordance with the collateral requirements at all times that it is outstanding rather than the previous requirement of only at the inception or upon material modification of the transaction these provisions also raise significantly the procedural and substantive hurdles required to obtain a regulatory exemption from the affiliate transaction requirements while these provisions became effective on july the federal reserve has not yet issued a proposed rule to implement them supervision and governance on november the federal reserve announced that it is adopting a new supervisory rating system for large financial institutions including bhcs with total consolidated assets of billion or more like keycorp lfi rating system in order to align the federal reserves rating system with the postcrisis supervisory programs for these firms the lfi rating system will provide a supervisory evaluation of whether an institution possesses sufficient operational strength and resilience to maintain safe and sound operations through a range of conditions and will assess an institutions capital planning and positions liquidity risk management and positions and governance and controls institutions subject to the lfi rating system will be rated using the following scale broadly meets expectations conditionally meets expectations deficient1 and deficient2 with the conditionally meets expectations rating intended to be used as a transitory rating to allow an institution time to remediate a concern identified during the supervisory evaluation the federal reserve assigned initial ratings under the lfi rating system in to institutions that are subject to the large institution supervision coordinating committee framework excluding keycorp and assigned initial ratings in for all other large financial institutions subject to this rating system including keycorp the governance and controls component of the lfi rating system is the subject of two separate but related proposals i proposed guidance regarding supervisory expectations for boards of directors of large financial institutions and ii proposed guidance regarding core principles for effective senior management business management and independent risk management and controls for large financial institutions the proposed guidance regarding supervisory expectations for boards of directors published by the federal reserve on august identifies the attributes of effective boards of directors that would be used by an examiner to evaluate an institutions governance and controls the proposal also clarifies that for all institutions supervised by the federal reserve most supervisory findings should be communicated to the organizations senior management for corrective action and not its board of directors in addition the proposal identifies existing supervisory expectations for boards of directors set forth in federal reserve supervision and regulation letters that could be eliminated or revised the federal reserve extended the comment period for the proposed guidance regarding supervisory expectations for boards of directors until february on january the federal reserve released the final proposal related to the lfi rating system the proposed guidance regarding core principles for effective senior management business management and independent risk management and controls for large financial institutions this guidance would support the supervisory evaluation under the governance and controls component of the lfi rating system together with the abovementioned guidance regarding the effectiveness of a firms board of directors in general the guidance proposes core principles for effective senior management business line management and the independent risk management and control function the guidance encourages firms to establish a governance structure with appropriate levels of independence and stature by appointing a chief risk officer and a chief audit officer finally the guidance emphasizes the importance of independent risk management internal controls and internal audit and establishes principles that firms should use to establish or augment those management and control frameworks comments on this proposal were due by march community reinvestment act the community reinvestment act cra was enacted in to encourage depository institutions to help meet the credit needs of the communities that they serve including low and moderateincome lmi neighborhoods consistent with the institutions safe and sound operations the cra requires the federal banking agencies to assess the record of each institution that they supervise in meeting the credit needs of its entire community including lmi neighborhoods on may the occ issued a final rule to revise the agencys cra regulation to strengthen and modernize the framework by which the occ assesses a banks cra performance the occ stated that it was doing so in order to make the cra regulatory framework more objective transparent consistent in application and reflective of changes in banking and thereby better achieve the statutory purpose of encouraging banks to serve the needs of their communities particularly lmi neighborhoods and other communities that have been underserved the final rule i clarifies and expands the activities that qualify for cra credit ii updates the definition of the assessment areas where activities are evaluated for cra purposes iii creates a more consistent and objective method for evaluating cra performance and iv provides for more timely and transparent crarelated data collection recordkeeping and reporting the occ indicated that it was deferring to a future rulemaking the decision for how to calibrate the thresholds benchmarks and minimums used in the rule to determine the level of performance necessary for a bank to achieve a specific performance rating the final rule became effective on october large national banks like keybank are required to comply with the rule by january on september the federal reserve issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking anpr requesting public comment on ways to modernize cra regulations by strengthening clarifying and tailoring them to reflect the current banking landscape and better achieve the core purpose of the cra the anpr seeks public feedback on ways to evaluate how banks meet the needs of lmi communities and address inequities in credit access when it issued the anpr the federal reserve said that it hoped the anpr would provide a foundation for the federal banking agencies to come together on a consistent approach to cra regulation that has broad support among all stakeholders comments are due by february if the federal banking agencies agree on a consistent approach to revising their cra regulations keybank will be required to comply with the revised regulations on november the occ requested public comment on an npr setting forth the occs proposed approach for determining the benchmarks thresholds and minimums that would be used in assessing a banks performance under the general performance standards contained in the occs final cra rule the proposal also explains how the occ would assess a significant decline in a banks cra activities following the initial establishment of the benchmarks thresholds and minimums further the proposal would make clarifying and technical amendments to the final cra rule comments on the npr are due by february on december the occ published a notice requesting comment on an information collection survey that the occ would require banks subject to the cra general performance standards to complete the occ said that it intends to use the bankspecific data that it collects from this survey to set the benchmarks thresholds and minimums that will correspond to the presumptive ratings under the cra rule comments on this notice are due by february control standards on january the federal reserve adopted a final rule setting forth a new comprehensive framework for determining control under the bhca and the home owners loan act the final rule simplifies and provides greater transparency regarding the standards used by the federal reserve to determine whether one company has control over another company the final rule codifies existing federal reserve precedents on control and makes certain targeted adjustments to these precedents the final rule provides a tiered framework that looks at the size of an investing companys voting and total equity investment in another company along with a variety of other factors including board representation officer and employee interlocks and the existence of business relationships between the companies by providing greater clarity regarding the standards that will be applied for control determinations the final rule may facilitate i bhcs making minority investments in nonbank companies and ii nonbank investors taking minority stakes in banking organizations the final rule became effective september regulatory developments concerning covid19 federal state and local governments have adopted various statutes rules regulations orders and guidelines in order to address the covid19 pandemic and the adverse economic effects of this pandemic on individuals families businesses and governments financial institutions including key are affected by many of these measures including measures that are broadly applicable to businesses operating in the communities where key does business financial services firms like other businesses are required to operate in a manner that seeks to protect the health and safety of their customers and employees during the covid19 crisis the federal banking agencies issued a number of statements encouraging financial institutions to meet the financial needs of their customers and have taken steps to provide financial institutions with additional flexibility to meet their customers needs certain of these steps are discussed above under the headings regulatory capital requirements recent regulatory capitalrelated developments and regulatory capital requirements capital planning and stress testing in addition the federal banking agencies along with state bank regulators issued an interagency statement on march addressing loan modifications that are made by financial institutions for borrowers affected by the covid19 crisis the agencies stated that shortterm loan modifications made on a good faith basis in response to covid19 for borrowers who were current prior to any relief do not need to be categorized as tdrs and that financial institutions are not expected to designate loans with deferrals granted due to covid19 as past due because of the deferral the cares act enacted on march contains a number of provisions that affect banking organizations the cares act provides funding for various programs under which the federal government will lend to guarantee loans to or make investments in businesses banking organizations are expected to play a role in some of these programs and when they do so they will be subject to certain requirements one of these programs is the ppp a program administered by the small business administration the sba to provide loans to small businesses for payroll and other basic expenses during the covid19 crisis the loans can be made by sbacertified lenders and are guaranteed by the sba the loans are eligible to be forgiven if certain conditions are satisfied in which event the sba will make payment to the lender for the forgiven amounts keybank has participated in the ppp as a lender the cares act also authorizes temporary changes to certain provisions applicable to banking organizations among other changes the cares act gives financial institutions the right to elect to suspend gaap principles and regulatory determinations for loan modifications relating to covid19 that would otherwise be categorized as tdrs from march through the earlier of december or days after the covid19 national emergency ends in addition the cares act requires mortgage servicers to grant on a borrowers request forbearance for up to days which can be extended for an additional days on a federallybacked singlefamily mortgage loan or forbearance for up to days which can be extended for two additional 30day periods on a federallybacked multifamily mortgage loan when the borrowers experience financial hardship as a result of the covid19 emergency on april federal banking agencies along with state bank regulators issued a joint statement indicating that the agencies do not plan to take supervisory or enforcement action against mortgage servicers for delays in taking lossmitigation actions or sending notices required by the mortgage servicing rules if they provide shortterm forbearance on mortgage loans to borrowers facing hardships relating to the covid19 emergency including forbearance provided in accordance with the cares act provided that the mortgage servicers make good faith efforts to take these actions and send these notices within a reasonable time on april the federal banking agencies in consultation with state bank regulators issued an interagency statement clarifying the interaction between i their earlier statement discussing whether loan modifications relating to covid19 need to be treated as tdrs and ii the cares act provision on this subject in this interagency statement the agencies also said that when exercising supervisory and enforcement responsibility with respect to consumer protection requirements they will take into account the unique circumstances impacting borrowers and institutions resulting from the covid19 emergency and that they do not expect to take a consumer compliance public enforcement action against an institution provided that the circumstances were related to this emergency and the institution made good faith efforts to support borrowers and comply with the consumer protection requirements and addressed any needed corrective action the federal reserve has established several lending facilities that are intended to support the flow of credit to households businesses and governments one of these facilities is the paycheck protection program liquidity facility ppplf which was set up to allow the federal reserve banks to extend credit to financial institutions that originate ppp loans taking the loans as collateral at face value on april the federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule to allow banking organizations to neutralize the effect of ppp loans financed under the ppplf on the leverage capital ratios of these organizations on september the federal banking agencies
