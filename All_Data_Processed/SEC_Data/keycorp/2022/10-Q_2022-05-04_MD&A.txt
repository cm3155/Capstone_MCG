free funds such as noninterestbearing deposits and equity capital the use of derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk interest rate fluctuations and competitive conditions within the marketplace asset quality and fair value accounting of acquired earning assets and interestbearing liabilities to make it easier to compare both the results across several periods and the yields on

measure and manage such risks across the entire enterprise to maintain safety and soundness and to maximize profitability there have been no significant changes in our risk management practices as described under the heading risk management beginning on page of our form 10k market risk management market risk is the risk that movements in market risk factors including interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices commodity prices credit spreads and volatilities will reduce keys income and the value of its portfolios these factors influence prospective yields values or prices associated with the instrument we are exposed to market risk both in our trading and nontrading activities which include asset and liability management activities information regarding our fair value policies procedures and methodologies is provided in note summary of significant accounting policies under the heading fair value measurements on page of our form 10k and note fair value measurements in this report trading market risk key incurs market risk as a result of trading activities that are used in support of client facilitation and hedging activities principally within our investment banking and capital markets businesses key has exposures to a wide range of risk factors including interest rates equity prices foreign exchange rates credit spreads and commodity prices as well as the associated implied volatilities and spreads our primary market risk exposures are a result of trading and hedging activities in the derivative and fixed income markets including securitization positions exposures at march we did not have any resecuritization positions we maintain modest trading inventories to facilitate customer flow make markets in securities and hedge certain risks including but not limited to credit risk and interest rate risk the risks associated with these activities are mitigated in accordance with the market risk hedging policy the majority of our positions are traded in active markets market risk management is an integral part of keys risk culture the risk committee of our board provides oversight of trading market risks the erm committee and the market risk committee regularly review and discuss market risk reports prepared by our mrm that contain our market risk exposures and results of monitoring activities market risk policies and procedures have been defined and approved by the market risk committee a tier risk governance committee and take into account our tolerance for risk and consideration for the business environment for more information regarding monitoring of trading positions and the activities related to the market risk rule compliance see market risk management beginnin g on page of our form 10k var and stressed var var is the estimate of the maximum amount of loss on an instrument or portfolio due to adverse market conditions during a given time interval within a stated confidence level stressed var is used to assess extreme conditions on market risk within our trading portfolios the mrm calculates var and stressed var on a daily basis and the results are distributed to appropriate management var and stressed var results are also provided to our regulators and utilized in regulatory capital calculations we use a historical simulation var model to measure the potential adverse effect of changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and credit spreads on the fair value of our covered positions and other noncovered positions we analyze market risk by portfolios and do not separately measure and monitor our portfolios by risk type historical scenarios are customized for specific positions and numerous risk factors are incorporated in the calculation additional consideration is given to the risk factors to estimate the exposures that contain optionality features such as options and cancellable provisions var is calculated using daily observations over a oneyear time horizon and approximates a confidence level statistically this means that we would expect to incur losses greater than var on average five out of trading days or three to four times each quarter we also calculate var and stressed var at a confidence level for more information regarding our var model its governance and assumptions see market risk management on page of our form 10k actual losses for the total covered portfolios did not exceed aggregate daily var on any day during the quarter ended march actual losses for the total covered portfolios did not exceed the aggregate daily var at a confidence level during the quarter ended march the mrm backtests our var model on a daily basis to evaluate its predictive power the test compares var model results at the confidence level to daily held profit and loss results of backtesting are provided to the market risk committee backtesting exceptions occur when trading losses exceed var we do not engage in correlation trading or utilize the internal model approach for measuring default and credit migration risk our net var approach incorporates diversification but our var calculation does not include the impact of counterparty risk and

our riskweighted assets include a market riskequivalent asset amount which consists of a var component stressed var component a de minimis exposure amount and a specific risk addon including the securitization positions the aggregate market value of the securitization positions as defined by the market risk rule was million at march all of which were mortgagebacked security positions specific risk is the price risk of individual financial instruments which is not accounted for by changes in broad market risk factors and is measured through a standardized approach market risk weighted assets including the specific risk calculations are run quarterly by the mrm in accordance with the market risk rule and approved by the chief market risk officer nontrading market risk most of our nontrading market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations and its impacts on our traditional loan and deposit products as well as investments hedging relationships longterm debt and certain shortterm borrowings interest rate risk which is inherent in the banking industry is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest income and the eve such fluctuations may result from changes in interest rates and differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities we manage the exposure to changes in net interest income and the eve in accordance with our risk appetite and in accordance with the board approved erm policy interest rate risk positions are influenced by a number of factors including the balance sheet positioning that arises out of customer preferences for loan and deposit products economic conditions the competitive environment within our markets changes in market interest rates that affect client activity and our hedging investing funding and capital positions the primary components of interest rate risk exposure consist of reprice risk basis risk yield curve risk and option risk reprice risk is the exposure to changes in the level of interest rates and occurs when the volume of interestbearing liabilities and the volume of interestearning assets they fund eg deposits used to fund loans do not mature or reprice at the same time basis risk is the exposure to asymmetrical changes in interest rate indexes and occurs when floatingrate assets and floatingrate liabilities reprice at the same time but in response to different market factors or indexes yield curve risk is the exposure to nonparallel changes in the slope of the yield curve where the yield curve depicts the relationship between the yield on a particular type of security and its term to maturity and occurs when interestbearing liabilities and the interestearning assets that they fund do not price or reprice to the same term point on the yield curve option risk is the exposure to a customer or counterpartys ability to take advantage of the interest rate environment and terminate or reprice one of our assets liabilities or offbalance sheet instruments prior to contractual maturity without a penalty option risk occurs when exposures to customer and counterparty early withdrawals or prepayments are not mitigated with an offsetting position or appropriate compensation the management of nontrading market risk is centralized within corporate treasury the risk committee of our board provides oversight of nontrading market risk the erm committee and the alco review reports on the interest rate risk exposures described above in addition the alco reviews reports on stress tests and sensitivity analyses related to interest rate risk these committees have various responsibilities related to managing nontrading market risk including recommending approving and monitoring strategies that maintain risk positions within approved tolerance ranges the alm policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of interest rate risk and is administered by the alco the mrm as the second line of defense provides additional oversight libor transition as disclosed in item risk factors of our form 10k libor in its current form will generally not be available after for new contracts and the libor administrator will cease publishing all us libor tenors entirely after june for most products the most likely replacement benchmark is expected to be sofr which has been recommended by the arrc although uncertainty remains as to whether new benchmarks may evolve and a different credit sensitive benchmark could instead become the marketaccepted benchmark the federal reserve and the occ have encouraged financial institutions not to wait for the end of to make the transition away from libor we have established an enterprise wide program to identify and address all libor transition issues we are collaborating closely with regulators and industry groups on the transition and closely monitoring developments in industry practices related to libor alternatives the goals of our libor transition program are to identify and analyze liborbased exposure and develop and execute transition strategies review and update nearterm strategies and actions for our liborbased business currently being written assess financial impact and risk while planning and executing mitigation actions understand and strategically address the current market approach to libor relative to transition to alternative reference rates post december determine and execute system and process work to be operationally ready for additional credit sensitive benchmarks and remediate remaining libor contracts as part of the libor transition program we completed an initial risk assessment to help us identify the impact and risks associated with various products systems processes and models this risk assessment has assisted us in making necessary updates to our infrastructure and operational systems and processes to implement a replacement rate and we are operationally ready for various sofrbased benchmarks including but not limited to daily simple sofr in arrears sofr compounded in arrears sofr averages in advance and term sofr we are actively quoting alternative indexes other than libor such as sofr and term sofr and have begun to originate new loans in those indexes we have also begun to originate a small number of new loans using credit sensitive rates in a limited and managed fashion we have compiled an inventory of existing legal contracts that are impacted by the libor transition we have assessed the libor fallback language in those contracts have devised a strategy to address the libor transition for those contracts and have begun the process of remediating such contracts our progress is wellpaced especially as many of the legacy contracts were provided additional time to remediate due to announcements by the ice benchmark administration the fcaregulated and authorized administrator of libor that certain libor tenors may continue until june for legacy contract purposes in addition we completed our work to address contracts with libor tenors that had to transition by the end of we expect to leverage recommendations made by the arrc and isda that are tailored to our specific client segments we are currently evaluating the impact of the adjustable interest rate libor act which was enacted on march the legislation provides a uniform national approach for replacing libor in legacy contracts that do not provide for the use of a clearly defined or practicable replacement benchmark rate as of march key had the following instruments that were either directly or indirectly dependent on libor dollars in millions maturity through june maturity past june outstanding balance of loans notional value of derivative contracts investment securities debt and equity instruments net interest income simulation analysis the primary tool we use to measure our interest rate risk is simulation analysis for purposes of this analysis we estimate our net interest income based on the current and projected composition of our on and offbalance sheet positions accounting for recent and anticipated trends in customer activity the analysis also incorporates assumptions for the current and projected interest rate environments and balance sheet growth projections based on a most likely macroeconomic view the modeling incorporates investment portfolio and swap portfolio balances consistent with managements desired interest rate risk positioning the simulation model estimates the amount of net interest income at risk by simulating the change in net interest income that would occur if rates were to gradually increase or decrease from current levels over the next months subject to a floor on market interest rates at zero figure presents the results of the simulation analysis at march and march at march our simulated impact to changes in interest rates was moderate the exposure to declining rates has increased as a result of higher starting rate levels and a larger balance sheet compared to the march analysis exposure to declining rates remains moderate given the relative low level of short term interest rates tolerance levels for risk management require the development of remediation plans to maintain residual risk within tolerance if simulation modeling demonstrates that a gradual parallel basis point increase or basis point decrease in interest rates over the next months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than current modeled exposure is within board approved tolerances figure simulated change in net interest income march march basis point change assumption assumed floor in market rates in basis points na na tolerance level interest rate risk assessment simulation analysis produces a sophisticated estimate of interest rate exposure based on assumptions input into the model we tailor certain assumptions to the specific interest rate environment and yield curve shape being modeled and validate those assumptions on a regular basis however actual results may differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to unanticipated changes to the balance sheet composition customer behavior product pricing market interest rates changes in managements desired interest rate risk positioning investment funding and hedging activities and repercussions from unanticipated or unknown events we also perform regular stress tests and sensitivity analyses on the model inputs that could materially change the resulting risk assessments assessments are performed using different shapes of the yield curve including steepening or flattening of the yield curve immediate changes in market interest rates and changes in the relationship of money market interest rates assessments are also performed on changes to the following assumptions loan and deposit balances the pricing of deposits without contractual maturities changes in lending spreads prepayments on loans and securities investment funding and hedging activities and liquidity and capital management strategies the results of additional assessments indicate that net interest income could increase or decrease from the base simulation results presented in figure net interest income is highly dependent on the timing magnitude frequency and path of interest rate changes and the associated assumptions for deposit repricing relationships lending spreads and the balance behavior of transaction accounts if fixed rate assets increase by billion or fixed rate liabilities decrease by billion then the benefit to rising rates would decrease by approximately basis points if the interestbearing liquid deposit beta assumption increases or decreases by eg to then the benefit to rising rates would decrease or increase by approximately basis points our current interest rate risk position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk depending on the competitive environment and client behavior that may affect the actual volume mix maturity and repricing characteristics of loan and deposit flows corporate treasury discretionary activities related to funding investing and hedging may also change as a result of changes in customer business flows or changes in managements desired interest rate risk positioning as changes occur to both the configuration of the balance sheet and the outlook for the economy management proactively evaluates hedging opportunities that may change our interest rate risk profile we also conduct simulations that measure the effect of changes in market interest rates in the second and third years of a threeyear horizon these simulations are conducted in a manner similar to those based on a 12month horizon to capture longerterm exposures we calculate exposures to changes of the eve as discussed in the following section economic value of equity modeling eve complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure beyond and 36month horizons eve modeling measures the extent to which the economic values of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates eve is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates measuring the resulting change in the values of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments and comparing those amounts with the base case of the current interest rate environment eve policy limits are measures against a basis pointpolicy decline scenario the policy decline scenario is equal to the current fed target rate capped at basis points as of march the policy decline scenario is reduced to the basis point minimum this analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with noncontractual maturities those assumptions are based on historical behaviors as well as our expectations we develop remediation plans that would maintain residual risk within tolerance if this analysis indicates that our eve will decrease by more than in response to an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates we are operating within these guidelines as of march management of interest rate exposure we use the results of our various interest rate risk analyses to formulate alm strategies to achieve the desired risk profile while managing to our objectives for capital adequacy and liquidity risk exposures specifically we manage interest rate risk positions by purchasing securities issuing term debt with floating or fixed interest rates and using derivatives we predominantly use interest rate swaps and options which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities figure shows all swap positions that we hold for alm purposes these positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreedupon amounts of assets and liabilities ie notional amounts to another interest rate index for example fixedrate debt is converted to a floating rate through a receive fixedpay variable interest rate swap the volume maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as we adjust our broader alm objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged for more information about how we use interest rate swaps to manage our risk profile see note

industry is measured by our ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations and fund new business opportunities at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions factors affecting liquidity our liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect events an example of a direct event would be a downgrade in our public credit ratings by a rating agency examples of indirect events events unrelated to us that could impair our access to liquidity would be an act of terrorism or war natural disasters global pandemics including covid19 political events or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation mutual fund or hedge fund similarly market speculation or rumors about us or the banking industry in general may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources see part i item risk factors section iv liquidity risk in our form 10k for a discussion of how the covid19 global

million of securities available for secured funding at the fhlb and billion of net balances of federal funds sold and balances in our federal reserve account additionally as of march our unused borrowing capacity secured by loan collateral was billion at the federal reserve bank of cleveland and billion at the fhlb during the first quarter of our secured term borrowings increased billion as additional advances were taken if the cash flows needed to support operating and investing activities are not satisfied by deposit balances we rely on wholesale funding or onbalance sheet liquid reserves conversely excess cash generated by operating investing and depositgathering activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets liquidity for keycorp the primary source of liquidity for keycorp is from subsidiary dividends primarily from keybank keycorp has sufficient liquidity when it can service its debt support customary corporate operations and activities including acquisitions support occasional guarantees of subsidiaries obligations in transactions with third parties at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences and fund capital distributions in the form of dividends and share buybacks at march keycorp held billion in cash which we projected to be sufficient to meet our projected obligations including the repayment of our maturing debt obligations for the periods prescribed by our risk tolerance typically keycorp meets its liquidity requirements through regular dividends from keybank supplemented with term debt during the first quarter of keybank paid million in cash dividends to keycorp as of march keybank had regulatory capacity to pay billion in dividends to keycorp without prior regulatory approval our liquidity position and recent activity over the past quarter our liquid asset portfolio which includes overnight and shortterm investments as well as unencumbered high quality liquid securities held as protection against a range of potential liquidity stress scenarios has decreased primarily from a decrease in cash balances resulting from the cash consumption related to loan growth and deposit outflow the liquid asset portfolio continues to exceed the amount that we estimate would be necessary to manage through an adverse liquidity event by providing sufficient time to develop and execute a

failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms like other financial services institutions we make loans extend credit purchase securities provide financial and payments products and enter into financial derivative contracts all of which have related credit risk credit policy approval and evaluation we manage credit risk exposure through a multifaceted program the credit risk committee approves management credit policies and recommends significant credit policies to the enterprise risk management committee the keybank board and the risk committee of the board for approval these policies are communicated throughout the organization to foster a consistent approach to granting credit our credit risk management team and certain individuals within our lines of business to whom credit risk management has delegated limited credit authority are responsible for credit approval individuals with assigned credit authority are authorized to grant exceptions to credit policies it is not unusual to make exceptions to established policies when mitigating circumstances dictate however a corporate level tolerance has been established to keep exceptions at an acceptable level based upon portfolio and economic considerations our credit risk management team uses risk models to evaluate consumer loans these models known as scorecards forecast the probability of serious delinquency and default for an applicant the scorecards are embedded in the application processing system which allows for realtime scoring and automated decisions for many of our products we periodically validate the loan scoring processes we maintain an active concentration management program to mitigate concentration risk in our credit portfolios for individual obligors we employ a sliding scale of exposure known as hold limits which is dictated by the type of loan and strength of the borrower allowance for loan and lease losses we estimate the appropriate level of the alll on at least a quarterly basis the methodology used is described in note summary of significant accounting policies under the heading allowance for loan and lease losses beginning on page of our form 10k briefly the

compliance risk management like all businesses we are subject to operational risk which is the risk of loss resulting from human error or malfeasance inadequate or failed internal processes and systems and external events these events include among other things threats to our cybersecurity as we are reliant upon information systems and the internet to conduct our business activities operational risk intersects with compliance risk which is the risk of loss from violations of or noncompliance with laws rules and regulations prescribed practices and ethical standards this includes our compliance with lending programs established by the cares act including the ppp and main street lending program under the doddfrank act large financial companies like key are subject to heightened prudential standards and regulation this heightened level of regulation has increased our operational risk while operational and compliance risk are separate risk disciplines in keycorps erm framework losses andor additional regulatory compliance costs are included in operational loss reporting and could take the form of explicit charges increased operational costs harm to our reputation or foregone opportunities we seek to mitigate operational risk through identification and measurement of risk alignment of business strategies with risk appetite and tolerance and a system of internal controls and reporting we continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to improve the oversight of our operational risk and to ensure compliance with laws rules and regulations for example an operational event database tracks the amounts and sources of operational risk and losses this tracking mechanism helps to identify weaknesses and to highlight the need to take corrective action we also rely upon software programs designed to assist in assessing operational risk and monitoring our control processes this technology has enhanced the reporting of the effectiveness of our controls to senior management and the board the operational risk management program provides the framework for the structure governance roles and responsibilities as well as the content to manage operational risk for key the compliance risk management program serves the same function in managing compliance risk for key the operational risk committee and the compliance risk committee support the erm committee by identifying early warning events and trends escalating emerging risks and discussing forwardlooking assessments both the operational risk committee and the compliance risk committee include attendees from each of the three lines of defense primary responsibility for managing and monitoring internal control mechanisms lies with the managers of our various lines of business the operational risk committee and compliance risk committee are senior management committees that oversee our level of operational and compliance risk and direct and support our operational and compliance infrastructure and related activities these committees and the operational risk management and compliance risk management functions are an integral part of our erm program our risk review function regularly assesses the overall effectiveness of our operational risk management and compliance risk management programs and our system of internal controls risk review reports

ability to fulfill their contractual obligations to us recent highprofile cyberattacks have targeted retailers credit bureaus and other businesses for the purpose of acquiring the confidential information including personal financial and credit card information of their customers recently there have also been numerous highly publicized cases where hackers requested ransom payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information or to restore company access to locked systems we may incur expenses related to the investigation of such attacks or related to the protection of our customers from identity theft as a result of such attacks we may also incur expenses to enhance our systems or processes to protect against cyber or other security incidents risks and exposures related to cyberattacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats as well as due to the expanding use of internet

complex consequently we must exercise judgment in choosing and applying accounting policies and methodologies these choices are critical not only are they necessary to comply with gaap they also reflect our view of the appropriate way to record and report our overall financial performance all accounting policies are important and all policies described in note summary of significant accounting policies beginning on page of our form 10k should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance note basis of presentation and accounting policies of this report should also be reviewed for more information on accounting standards that have been adopted during the period in our opinion some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a critical effect on our financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility these policies apply to areas of relatively greater business importance or require us to exercise judgment and to make assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements because these assumptions and estimates are based on current circumstances they may prove to be inaccurate or we may find it necessary to change them we rely heavily on the use of judgment assumptions and estimates to make a number of core decisions including accounting for the alll contingent liabilities guarantees and income taxes derivatives and related hedging activities and assets and liabilities that involve valuation methodologies in addition we may employ outside valuation experts to assist us in determining fair values of certain assets and liabilities a brief discussion of each of these areas appe ars on pages through of our form 10k during

alternate rates will impact among other things contracts that reference libor this asu provides relief from cumbersome accounting consequences for certain qualifying contract modifications undertaken as a result of reference rate reform key has established an enterprisewide program to identify and address all libor related issues we have elected to apply certain optional expedients for contract modifications and hedging relationships to derivative instruments impacted by the marketwide discounting transition these optional expedients remove the requirement to remeasure contract modifications

falling under the scope of reference rate reform asu debtdebt with conversion and other options subtopic and derivatives and hedging contracts in entitys own equity subtopic january the asu simplifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments by eliminating the legacy accounting models for convertible instruments with beneficial conversion features or cash conversion features the guidance also amends the guidance used to determine if a freestanding financial instrument or an embedded feature qualifies for a scope exception from derivative accounting for freestanding financial instruments and embedded features that have all the characteristics of a derivative instrument and are potentially settled in an entitys own stock the guidance simplifies the settlement assessment that entities are required to perform also the update now requires the use of the ifconverted method for all convertible instruments and includes the effect of potential share settlement in diluted eps if the effect is more dilutive the new guidance also makes clarifications to the eps calculation further the asu expands disclosure requirements the guidance should be applied on a modified

described in note summary of significant accounting policies under the heading allowance for loan and lease losses beginning on page of our form 10k we estimate the alll using relevant available information from internal and external sources relating to past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts in our estimation of expected credit losses we use a two year reasonable and supportable period across all products following this two year period in which supportable forecasts can be generated for all modeled loan portfolios we revert expected credit losses to a level that is consistent with our historical information by reverting the macroeconomic variables model inputs to their long run average we revert to historical loss rates for less complex estimation methods for smaller portfolios a year fixed length look back period is used to calculate the long run average of the macroeconomic variables a four quarter reversion period is used where the macroeconomic variables linearly revert to their long run average following the two year reasonable and supportable period we develop our reasonable and supportable forecasts using relevant data including but not limited to changes in economic output unemployment rates property values and other factors associated with the credit losses on financial assets some macroeconomic variables apply to all portfolio segments while others are more portfolio specific the following table discloses key macroeconomic variables for each loan portfolio segment portfolio key macroeconomic variables a

drivers additionally variables may have varying impacts at different points in the economic cycle in addition to macroeconomic drivers portfolio attributes such as remaining term outstanding balance risk ratings utilization fico ltv and delinquency also drive alll changes our alll models were designed to capture the correlation between economic and portfolio changes as such evaluating shifts in individual portfolio attributes and macroeconomic variables in isolation may not be indicative of past or future performance economic outlook as of march economic growth is expected to be healthy but the russianukrainian conflict has provided additional stress on global supply chains adding uncertainty to the outlook and stress to existing inflationary pressures inflation in the united states is at high levels monetary policy is projected to become more restrictive which is expected to reduce inflation throughout the remainder of employment levels continue to be very strong with unemployment rates expected to remain at relatively low levels we utilized the moodys february consensus forecast as our baseline forecast to estimate our expected credit losses as of march we determined such forecast to be a reasonable view of the outlook for the economy given all available information at quarter end the baseline scenario continues to reflect moderate economic growth over the next two years in markets in which we operate us gdp continues to grow albeit at a slower pace at a annualized rate in the first quarter of and at an annual rate of approximately and for and respectively the national unemployment rate forecast is in the first quarter of and is expected to decline to by the fourth quarter of and continue at that level through the fourth quarter of we recognize the baseline forecast may not fully capture the increased economic uncertainty emerging as of quarterend specifically due to the russiaukraine conflict and monetary policy pressures these considerations were addressed through qualitative adjustments as a result of the current economic uncertainty our future loss estimates may vary considerably from our march assumptions commercial loan portfolio the alll from continuing operations for the commercial segment increased by million or from december the overall increase in the allowance is driven by loan growth and economic uncertainties geopolitical and monetary policy offset by reductions in covidrelated reserves the primary changes to the outlook are due to russiaukraine crisis as well as the associated risk around the global supply chain and inflation improvements in real estate price indices led to a reduction in reserve for our commercial real estate portfolio as of march there was an immaterial alll associated with million of outstanding ppp loans this alll relates to a small number of loans denied by the sba for forgiveness consumer loan portfolio the alll from continuing operations for the consumer segment increased by million or from december the overall increase in the allowance is driven by higher uncertainty in the economic outlook in addition to loan growth the most meaningful changes in the economic outlook contributing to the increase in reserves are the ongoing conflict in ukraine and us inflationarymonetary policy pressures the potential incremental risk associated with these economic factors is largely considered through qualitative reserve adjustments as it relates to the changes in the alll due to portfolio factors shifts are largely driven by targeted growth in the consumer real estate and laurel road student lending portfolios credit risk profile the prevalent risk characteristic for both commercial and consumer loans is the risk of loss arising from an obligors inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms evaluation of this risk is stratified and monitored by the loan risk rating grades assigned for the commercial loan portfolios and the refreshed fico score assigned for the consumer loan portfolios the internal risk grades assigned to loans follow our definitions of pass and criticized which are consistent with published definitions of regulatory risk classifications loans with a pass rating represent those loans not classified on our rating scale for problem credits as minimal credit risk has been identified criticized loans are those loans that either have a potential weakness deserving managements close attention or have a welldefined weakness that may put full collection of contractual cash flows at risk borrower fico scores provide information about the credit quality of our consumer loan portfolio as they provide an indication as to the likelihood that a debtor will repay its debts the scores are obtained from a nationally recognized consumer rating agency and are presented in the tables below at the dates indicated most extensions of credit are subject to loan grading or scoring loan grades are assigned at the time of origination verified by credit risk management and periodically reevaluated thereafter this risk rating methodology blends our judgment with quantitative modeling commercial loans generally are assigned two internal risk ratings the first rating reflects the probability that the borrower will default on an obligation the second rating reflects expected recovery rates on the credit facility default probability is determined based on among other factors the financial strength of the borrower an assessment of the borrowers management the borrowers competitive position

similar securities traded in the secondary markets d the fair value of loans is based on the present value of the expected cash flows the projected cash flows are based on the contractual terms of the loans adjusted for prepayments and use of a discount rate based on the relative risk of the cash flows taking into account the loan type maturity of the loan liquidity risk servicing costs and a required return on debt and capital in addition an incremental liquidity discount is applied to certain loans using historical sales of loans during periods of similar economic conditions as a
