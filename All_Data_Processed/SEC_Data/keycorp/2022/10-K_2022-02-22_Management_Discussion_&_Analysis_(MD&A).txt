risk factors including interest rates equity prices foreign exchange rates credit spreads and commodity prices as well as the associated implied volatilities and spreads our primary market risk exposures are a result of trading and hedging activities in the derivative and fixed income markets including securitization exposures at december we did not have any resecuritization positions we maintain modest trading inventories to facilitate customer flow make markets in securities and hedge certain risks including but not limited to credit risk and interest rate risk the risks associated with these activities are mitigated in accordance with the market risk hedging policy the majority of our positions are traded in active markets management of trading market risks market risk management is an integral part of keys risk culture the risk committee of our board provides oversight of trading market risks the erm committee and the market risk committee regularly review and

significant market risks monitoring compliance with established limits and escalating limit exceptions to appropriate senior management the various business units and trading desks are responsible for ensuring that market risk exposures are wellmanaged and prudent market risk is monitored through various measures such as var and through routine stress testing sensitivity and scenario analyses the mrm conducts stress tests for each position using historical worst case and standard shock scenarios var stressed var and other analyses are prepared daily and distributed to appropriate management covered positions we monitor the market risk of our covered positions as defined in the market risk rule which includes all of our trading positions as well as all foreign exchange and commodity positions regardless of whether the position is in a trading account keys covered positions may also include mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities that may be identified as securitization positions or resecuritization positions under the market risk rule the mrm as well as the lob that trades securitization positions monitor the positions the portfolio composition and the risks identified in this section on a daily basis consistent with the market risk policies and procedures at december covered positions did not include any resecuritization positions instruments that are used to hedge nontrading activities such as bankissued debt and loan portfolios equity positions that are not actively traded and securities financing activities do not meet the definition of a covered position the mrm is responsible for identifying our portfolios as either covered or noncovered the covered position working group develops the final list of covered positions and a summary is provided to the market risk committee our significant portfolios of covered positions are detailed below we analyze market risk by portfolios of covered positions and do not separately measure and monitor our portfolios by risk type the descriptions below incorporate the respective risk types associated with each of these portfolios fixed income includes those instruments associated with our capital markets business and the trading of securities as a dealer these instruments may include positions in municipal bonds bonds backed by the us government agency and corporate bonds certain mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities securities issued by the us treasury money markets and certain cmos the activities and instruments within the fixed income portfolio create exposures to interest rate and credit spread risks interest rate derivatives include interest rate swaps caps and floors which are transacted primarily to accommodate the needs of commercial loan clients in addition we enter into interest rate derivatives to offset or mitigate the interest rate risk related to the client positions the activities within this portfolio create exposures to interest rate risk var and stressed var var is the estimate of the maximum amount of loss on an instrument or portfolio due to adverse market conditions during a given time interval within a stated confidence level stressed var is used to assess extreme conditions on market risk within our trading portfolios the mrm calculates var and stressed var on a daily basis and the results are distributed to appropriate management var and stressed var results are also provided to our regulators and utilized in regulatory capital calculations table of contents we use a historical simulation var model to measure the potential adverse effect of changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and credit spreads on the fair value of our covered positions and other noncovered positions historical scenarios are customized for specific positions and numerous risk factors are incorporated in the calculation additional consideration is given to the risk factors to estimate the exposures that contain optionality features such as options and cancellable provisions var is calculated using daily observations over a oneyear time horizon and approximates a confidence level statistically this means that we would expect to incur losses greater than var on average five out of trading days or three to four times each quarter we also calculate var and stressed var at a confidence level the var model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of possible gains and losses on our positions however there are limitations inherent in the var model since it uses historical results over a given time interval to estimate future performance historical results may not be indicative of future results and changes in the market or composition of our portfolios could have a significant impact on the accuracy of the var model we regularly review and enhance the modeling techniques inputs and assumptions used our market risk policy includes the independent validation of our var model by keys internal model validation group on an annual basis the model risk committee oversees the model validation program and results of validations are discussed with the erm committee actual losses for the total covered positions did not exceed aggregate daily var on any day during the quarters ended december and december the mrm back tests our var model on a daily basis to evaluate its predictive power the test compares var model results at the confidence level to daily held profit and loss results of back testing are provided to the market risk committee back testing exceptions occur when trading losses exceed var we do not engage in correlation trading or utilize the internal model approach for measuring default and credit migration risk our net var approach incorporates diversification but our var calculation does not include the impact of counterparty risk and our own credit spreads on derivatives the aggregate var at the confidence level with a one day holding period for all covered

mortgagebacked security positions specific risk is the price risk of individual financial instruments which is not accounted for by changes in broad market risk factors and is measured through a standardized approach market risk weighted assets including the specific risk calculations are run quarterly by the mrm in accordance with the market risk rule and approved by the chief market risk officer nontrading market risk most of our nontrading market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations and its impacts on our traditional loan and deposit products as well as investments hedging relationships longterm debt and certain shortterm borrowings interest rate risk which is inherent in the banking industry is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest income and the eve such fluctuations may result from changes in interest rates and differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities we manage the exposure to changes in net interest income and the eve in accordance with our risk appetite and in accordance with the board approved erm policy interest rate risk positions are influenced by a number of factors including the balance sheet positioning that arises out of customer preferences for loan and deposit products economic conditions the competitive environment within our markets changes in market interest rates that affect client activity and our hedging investing funding and capital positions the primary components of interest rate risk exposure consist of reprice risk basis risk yield curve risk and option risk reprice risk is the exposure to changes in the level of interest rates and occurs when the volume of interestbearing liabilities and the volume of interestearning assets they fund eg deposits used to fund loans do not mature or reprice at the same time basis risk is the exposure to asymmetrical changes in interest rate indexes and occurs when floatingrate assets and floatingrate liabilities reprice at the same time but in response to different market factors or indexes yield curve risk is the exposure to nonparallel changes in the slope of the yield curve where the yield curve depicts the relationship between the yield on a particular type of security and its term to maturity and occurs when interestbearing liabilities and the interestearning assets that they fund do not price or reprice to the same term point on the yield curve option risk is the exposure to a customer or counterpartys ability to take advantage of the interest rate environment and terminate or reprice one of our assets liabilities or offbalance sheet instruments prior to contractual maturity without a penalty option risk occurs when exposures to customer and counterparty early withdrawals or prepayments are not mitigated with an offsetting position or appropriate compensation the management of nontrading market risk is centralized within corporate treasury the risk committee of our board provides oversight of nontrading market risk the erm committee and the alco review reports on the interest rate risk exposures described above in addition the alco reviews reports on stress tests and sensitivity analyses related to interest rate risk these committees have various responsibilities related to managing nontrading market risk including recommending approving and monitoring strategies that maintain risk positions within approved tolerance ranges the alm policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of interest rate risk and is administered by the alco the mrm as the second line of defense provides additional oversight libor transition as disclosed in item risk factors of this report libor in its current form will generally not be available after for new contracts and the libor administrator will cease publishing all us libor tenors entirely after june for most products the most likely replacement rate is expected to be sofr which has been recommended by the arrc although uncertainty remains as to whether new benchmarks may evolve and a different credit sensitive benchmark could instead become the marketaccepted benchmark the federal reserve and the occ have encouraged financial institutions not to wait for the end of to make the transition away from libor we have established an enterprise wide program to identify and address all libor transition issues we table of contents are collaborating closely with regulators and industry groups on the transition and closely monitoring developments in industry practices related to libor alternatives the goals of our libor transition program are to identify and analyze liborbased exposure and develop and execute transition strategies review and update nearterm strategies and actions for our liborbased business in response to evolving regulatory and market conditions assess financial impact and risk while planning and executing mitigation actions understand and strategically address the market approach to libor leading up to december and then post december relative to transition to alternative reference rates determine and execute system and process work to be operationally ready for additional credit sensitive benchmarks and remediate remaining libor contracts as part of the libor transition program we completed an initial risk assessment to help us identify the impact and risks associated with various products systems processes and models this risk assessment has assisted us in making necessary updates to our infrastructure and operational systems and processes to implement a replacement rate and we are operationally ready for various sofrbased benchmarks including but not limited to daily simple sofr in arrears sofr compounded in arrears sofr averages in advance and term sofr we are actively quoting alternative indexes other than libor such as sofr and term sofr and have begun to originate new loans in those indexes we have also begun to originate a small number of new loans using credit sensitive rates in a limited and managed fashion we have compiled an inventory of existing legal contracts that are impacted by the libor transition we have assessed the libor fallback language in those contracts and are devising a strategy to address the libor transition for those contracts our progress is wellpaced especially as many of the legacy contracts will be provided additional time to remediate due to announcements by the ice benchmark administration the fcaregulated and authorized administrator of libor that certain libor tenors may continue until june for legacy contract purposes in addition we completed our work to address contracts with libor tenors that had to transition by

through june maturity past june total exposures outstanding balance of loans notional value of derivative contracts investment securities debt and equity instruments table end net interest income simulation analysis the primary tool we use to measure our interest rate risk is simulation analysis for purposes of this analysis we estimate our net interest income based on the current and projected composition of our on and offbalance sheet positions accounting for recent and anticipated trends in customer activity the analysis also incorporates assumptions for the current and projected interest rate environments and balance sheet growth projections based on a most likely macroeconomic view the modeling incorporates investment portfolio and swap portfolio balances consistent with managements desired interest rate risk positioning the simulation model estimates the amount of net interest income at risk by simulating the change in net interest income that would occur if rates were to gradually increase or decrease over the next months subject to a floor on market interest rates at zero figure presents the results of the simulation analysis at december and december at december our simulated impact to changes in interest rates was modest exposure to declining rates remains nominal given the low level of market rates in comparison to the floor utilized in the scenario exposure to rising rates has was relatively stable while exposure to declining rates increased due to higher market rates leaving room for term rates to fall tolerance levels for risk management require the development of remediation plans to maintain residual risk within tolerance if simulation modeling demonstrates that a gradual parallel basis point increase or basis point decrease in interest rates over the next months would adversely affect table of contents net interest income over the same period by more than current modeled exposure is within board approved tolerances figure simulated change in net interest income table start december december basis point change assumption shortterm rates assumed floor in market rates in basis points na na tolerance level interest rate risk assessment table end simulation analysis produces a sophisticated estimate of interest rate exposure based on assumptions input into the model we tailor certain assumptions to the specific interest rate environment and yield curve shape being modeled and validate those assumptions on a regular basis however actual results may differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to unanticipated changes to the balance sheet composition customer behavior product pricing market interest rates changes in managements desired interest rate risk positioning investment funding and hedging activities and repercussions from unanticipated or unknown events we also perform regular stress tests and sensitivity analyses on the model inputs that could materially change the resulting risk assessments assessments are performed using different shapes of the yield curve including steepening or flattening of the yield curve immediate changes in market interest rates and changes in the relationship of money market interest rates assessments are also performed on changes to the following assumptions loan and deposit balances the pricing of deposits without contractual maturities changes in lending spreads prepayments on loans and securities investment funding and hedging activities and liquidity and capital management strategies the results of additional assessments indicate that net interest income could increase or decrease from the base simulation results presented in figure net interest income is highly dependent on the timing magnitude frequency and path of interest rate changes and the associated assumptions for deposit repricing relationships lending spreads and the balance behavior of transaction accounts if fixed rate assets increase by billion or fixed rate liabilities decrease by billion then the benefit to rising rates would decrease by approximately basis points if the interestbearing liquid deposit beta assumption increases or decreases by eg to then the benefit to rising rates would decrease or increase by approximately basis points our current interest rate risk position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk depending on the competitive environment and client behavior that may affect the actual volume mix maturity and repricing characteristics of loan and deposit flows corporate treasury discretionary activities related to funding investing and hedging may also change as a result of changes in customer business flows or changes in managements desired interest rate risk positioning as changes occur to both the configuration of the balance sheet and the outlook for the economy management proactively evaluates hedging opportunities that may change our interest rate risk profile we also conduct simulations that measure the effect of changes in market interest rates in the second and third years of a threeyear horizon these simulations are conducted in a manner similar to those based on a 12month horizon to capture longerterm exposures we calculate exposures to changes of the eve as discussed in the following section economic value of equity modeling eve complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure beyond and 36month horizons eve modeling measures the extent to which the economic values of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates eve is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates measuring the resulting change in the values of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments and comparing those amounts with the base case of the current interest rate environment the interest rate shock scenarios are equal to the current fed target rate capped at basis points in the current low rate environment the declining shock scenario is reduced with a basis point minimum this analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with noncontractual maturities those assumptions are based on historical behaviors as well as our expectations we develop remediation plans that would maintain residual risk within tolerance if this analysis indicates that our eve will decrease by more than in response to an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates we are operating within these guidelines as of december table of contents management of interest rate exposure we use the results of our various interest rate risk analyses to formulate alm strategies to achieve the desired risk profile while managing to our objectives for capital adequacy and liquidity risk exposures specifically we manage interest rate risk positions by purchasing securities issuing term debt with floating or fixed interest rates and using derivatives we predominantly use interest rate swaps and options which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities figure shows all derivative positions that we hold for alm purposes the swap positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreedupon amounts of assets and liabilities ie notional amounts to another interest rate index for example fixedrate debt is converted to a floating rate through a receive fixedpay variable interest rate swap the volume maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as we adjust our broader alm objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged for more information about how we use interest rate swaps to manage our risk profile see note

is measured by our ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations and fund new business opportunities at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions governance structure we manage liquidity for all of our affiliates on an integrated basis this approach considers the unique funding sources available to each entity as well as each entitys capacity to manage through adverse conditions the approach also recognizes that adverse market conditions or other events that could negatively affect the availability or cost of liquidity will affect the access of all affiliates to sufficient wholesale funding the management of consolidated liquidity risk is centralized within corporate treasury oversight and governance is provided by the board the erm committee the alco and the chief risk officer the asset liability management policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of liquidity risk and is administered by the alco the corporate treasury oversight group within the mrm as the second line of defense provides additional oversight our current liquidity risk management practices are in compliance with the federal reserve boards enhanced prudential standards these committees regularly review liquidity and funding summaries liquidity trends peer comparisons variance analyses liquidity projections hypothetical funding erosion stress tests and goal tracking reports the reviews generate a discussion of positions trends and directives on liquidity risk and shape a number of our decisions when liquidity pressure is elevated positions are monitored more closely and reporting is more intensive to ensure that emerging issues are identified we also communicate with individuals inside and outside of the company on a daily basis table of contents factors affecting liquidity our liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect events an example of a direct event would be a downgrade in our public credit ratings by a rating agency examples of indirect events events unrelated to us that could impair our access to liquidity would be an act of terrorism or war natural disasters global pandemics including covid19 political events or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation mutual fund or hedge fund similarly market speculation or rumors about us or the banking industry in general may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources our credit ratings at december are shown in figure we believe these credit ratings under

is derived from our business model which involves taking in deposits many of which can be withdrawn at anytime and lending them out in the form of illiquid loan assets the assessments of liquidity risk are measured under the assumption of normal operating conditions as well as under a stressed environment we manage these exposures in accordance with our risk appetite and within boardapproved policy limits we regularly monitor our liquidity position and funding sources and measure our capacity to obtain funds in a variety of hypothetical scenarios in an effort to maintain an appropriate mix of available and affordable funding in the normal course of business we perform a monthly hypothetical funding erosion stress test for both keycorp and keybank in a heightened monitoring mode we may conduct the hypothetical funding erosion stress tests more frequently and use assumptions to reflect the changed market environment our testing incorporates estimates for loan and deposit lives based on our historical studies erosion stress tests analyze potential liquidity scenarios under various funding constraints and time periods ultimately they determine the periodic effects that major direct and indirect events would have on our access to funding markets and our ability to fund our normal operations to compensate for the effect of these assumed liquidity pressures we consider alternative sources of liquidity and maturities over different time periods to project how funding needs would be managed we maintain a contingency funding plan that outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis the plan provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions it also assigns specific roles and responsibilities for managing liquidity through a problem period as part of the plan we maintain onbalance sheet liquid reserves referred to as our liquid asset portfolio which consists of high quality liquid assets during a problem period that reserve could be used as a source of funding to provide time to develop and execute a longerterm strateg y the liquid asset portfolio at december totaled billion consisting of billion of unpledged securities million of securities available for secured funding at the fhlb and billion of net balances of federal funds sold and balances in our federal reserve account the liquid asset portfolio can fluctuate due to excess liquidity heightened risk changes in market value or prefunding of expected outflows such as debt maturities additionally as of december our unused borrowing capacity secured by loan collateral was billion at the federal reserve bank of cleveland and billion at the fhlb of cincinnati in keys outstanding fhlb of cincinnati advances decreased by million due to a decrease in borrowings table of contents longterm liquidity strategy our longterm liquidity strategy is to be predominantly funded by core deposits however we may use wholesale funds to sustain an adequate liquid asset portfolio meet daily cash demands and allow management flexibility to execute business initiatives keys clientbased relationship strategy provides for a strong core deposit base that in conjunction with intermediate and longterm wholesale funds managed to a diversified maturity structure and investor base supports our liquidity risk management strategy we use the loantodeposit ratio as a metric to monitor these strategies our target loantodeposit ratio is at december our loantodeposit ratio was which we calculate as the sum of total loans loans held for sale and nonsecuritized discontinued loans divided by deposits sources of liquidity our primary sources of liquidity include customer deposits wholesale funding and liquid assets if the cash flows needed to support operating and investing activities are not satisfied by deposit balances we rely on wholesale funding or onbalance sheet liquid reserves conversely excess cash generated by operating investing and depositgathering activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets liquidity programs we have several liquidity programs which are described in note longterm debt that are designed to enable keycorp and keybank to raise funds in the public and private debt markets the proceeds from most of these programs can be used for general corporate purposes including acquisitions these liquidity programs are reviewed from time to time by the board and are renewed and replaced as necessary there are no restrictive financial covenants in any of these programs on june keybank issued million fixedtofloating rate senior bank notes due june and million floating rate senior bank notes due june liquidity for keycorp the primary source of liquidity for keycorp is from subsidiary dividends primarily from keybank keycorp has sufficient liquidity when it can service its debt support customary corporate operations and activities including acquisitions support occasional guarantees of subsidiaries obligations in transactions with third parties at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences and fund capital distributions in the form of dividends and share buybacks we use a parent cash coverage months metric as the primary measure to assess parent company liquidity the parent cash coverage months metric measures the number of months into the future where projected obligations can be met with the current quantity of liquidity we generally issue term debt to supplement dividends from keybank to manage our liquidity position at or above our targeted levels the parent company generally maintains cash and shortterm investments in an amount sufficient to meet projected debt maturities over at least the next months at december keycorp held billion in cash which we projected to be sufficient to meet our projected obligations including the repayment of our maturing debt obligations for the periods prescribed by our risk tolerance typically keycorp meets its liquidity requirements through regular dividends from keybank supplemented with term debt federal banking law limits the amount of capital distributions that a bank can make to its holding company without prior regulatory approval a national banks dividendpaying capacity is affected by several factors including net profits as defined by statute for the two previous calendar years and for the current year up to the date of dividend declaration during keybank paid billion in cash dividends to keycorp at january keybank had regulatory capacity to pay million in dividends to keycorp without prior regulatory approval table of contents our liquidity position and recent activity over the past months our liquid asset portfolio which includes overnight and shortterm investments as well as unencumbered high quality liquid securities held as protection against a range of potential liquidity stress scenarios has increased as a result of the elevated level of deposits the liquid asset portfolio continues to exceed the amount that we estimate would be necessary to manage through an adverse liquidity event by providing sufficient time to develop and execute a longerterm solution from time to time keycorp or keybank may seek to retire repurchase or exchange outstanding debt capital securities preferred shares or common shares through cash purchase privately negotiated transactions or other means additional information on repurchases of common shares by keycorp is included in part ii item market for the registrants common equity related

like other financial services institutions we make loans extend credit purchase securities provide financial and payments products and enter into financial derivative contracts all of which have related credit risk credit policy approval and evaluation we manage credit risk exposure through a multifaceted program the credit risk committee approves management credit policies and recommends significant credit policies to the enterprise risk management committee the keybank board and the risk committee of the board for approval these policies are communicated throughout the organization to foster a consistent approach to granting credit our credit risk management team and certain individuals within our lines of business to whom credit risk management has delegated limited credit authority are responsible for credit approval individuals with assigned credit authority are authorized to grant exceptions to credit policies it is not unusual to make exceptions to established policies when mitigating circumstances dictate however a corporate level tolerance has been established to keep exceptions at an acceptable level based upon portfolio and economic considerations our credit risk management team uses risk models to evaluate consumer loans these models known as scorecards forecast the probability of serious delinquency and default for an applicant the scorecards are embedded in the application processing system which allows for realtime scoring and automated decisions for many of our products we periodically validate the loan scoring processes we maintain an active concentration management program to mitigate concentration risk in our credit portfolios for individual obligors we employ a sliding scale of exposure known as hold limits which is dictated by the type of loan and strength of the borrower table of contents allowance for loan and lease losses we estimate the appropriate level of the alll on at least a quarterly basis the methodology used is

all businesses we are subject to operational risk which is the risk of loss resulting from human error or malfeasance inadequate or failed internal processes and systems and external events these events include among other things threats to our cybersecurity as we are reliant upon information systems and the internet to conduct our business activities operational risk intersects with compliance risk which is the risk of loss from violations of or noncompliance with laws rules and regulations prescribed practices and ethical standards this includes our compliance with lending programs established by the cares act including the ppp and main street lending program under the doddfrank act large financial companies like key are subject to heightened prudential standards and regulation this heightened level of regulation has increased our operational risk while operational and compliance risk are separate risk disciplines in keycorps erm framework losses andor additional regulatory compliance costs are included in operational loss reporting and could take the form of explicit charges increased operational costs harm to our reputation or foregone opportunities we seek to mitigate operational risk through identification and measurement of risk alignment of business strategies with risk appetite and tolerance and a system of internal controls and reporting we continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to improve the oversight of our operational risk and to ensure compliance with laws rules and regulations for example an operational event database tracks the amounts and sources of operational risk and losses this tracking mechanism helps to identify weaknesses and to highlight the need to take corrective action we also rely upon software programs designed to assist in assessing operational risk and monitoring our control processes this technology has enhanced the reporting of the effectiveness of our controls to senior management and the board the operational risk management program provides the framework for the structure governance roles and responsibilities as well as the content to manage operational risk for key the compliance risk management program serves the same function in managing compliance risk for key the operational risk committee and the compliance risk committee support the erm committee by identifying early warning events and trends escalating emerging risks and discussing forwardlooking assessments both the operational risk committee and the compliance risk committee include attendees from each of the three lines of defense primary responsibility for managing and monitoring internal control mechanisms lies with the managers of our various lines of business the operational risk committee and compliance risk committee are senior management committees that oversee our level of operational and compliance risk and direct and support our operational and compliance infrastructure and related activities these committees and the operational risk management and compliance risk management functions are an integral part of our erm program our risk review function regularly assesses the overall effectiveness of our operational risk management and compliance risk management programs and our system of internal controls risk review reports the results of reviews on internal controls

or cause other damage as the threat landscape continues to evolve critical infrastructure including financial services remains a top target for cyberattacks covid19 has created a unique situation globally with many more employees and thirdparty service providers working from home which inherently introduces additional risk cyberattacks may include but are not limited to attacks that are intended to disrupt or disable banking services and prevent banking transactions attempts to breach the security of systems and data and social engineering attempts aimed at tricking employees and clients into providing sensitive information or executing financial transactions cyberattack risks may also occur with our thirdparty technology service providers and may result in financial loss or liability that could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations cyberattacks could also interfere with thirdparty providers ability to fulfill their contractual obligations to us recent highprofile cyberattacks have targeted retailers credit bureaus and other businesses for the purpose of acquiring the confidential information including personal financial and credit card

company access to locked systems we may incur expenses related to the table of contents investigation of such attacks or related to the protection of our customers from identity theft as a result of such attacks we may also incur expenses to enhance our systems or processes to protect against cyber or other security incidents risks and exposures related to cyberattacks are expected to remain high

estimates our business is dynamic and complex consequently we must exercise judgment in choosing and applying accounting policies and methodologies these choices are critical not only are they necessary to comply with gaap they also reflect our view of the appropriate way to record and report our overall financial performance all accounting policies are important and all policies described in note summary of significant accounting policies should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance in our opinion some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a critical effect on our financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility these policies apply to areas of relatively greater business importance or require us to exercise judgment and to make assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements because these assumptions and estimates are based on current circumstances they may prove to be inaccurate or we may find it necessary to change them the following is a description of our current critical accounting policies allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan and lease losses represents managements estimate of all expected credit losses over the expected contractual life of our existing loan portfolio determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain these critical estimates include significant use of our own historical data and complex methods to interpret them we have an ongoing process to evaluate and enhance the quality quantity and timeliness of our data and interpretation methods used in the determination of these allowances these evaluations are inherently subjective as they require material estimates and may be susceptible to significant change and include among others pd lgd outstanding balance of the loan movement through delinquency stages amounts and timing of expected future cash flows value of collateral which may be obtained from third parties economic forecasts which are obtained from a third party provider and qualitative factors such as changes in current economic conditions that may not be reflected in modeled results as described in our accounting policy related to the alll in note basis of presentation and accounting policies of this report under the heading allowance for loan and lease losses we employ a disciplined process and methodology to establish our alll which has three main components i asset specific individual loan reserves ii quantitative formulaic or pooled reserves and iii qualitative judgmental reserves we use a nondcf factorbased approach to estimate expected credit losses that include component pdlgdead models as well as less complex estimation methods for smaller loan portfolios probability of default models estimate the likelihood a borrower will cease making payments as agreed these models use observed loanlevel table of contents information and projected paths of macroeconomic variables borrower credit attributes including fico scores of consumers and internally assigned risk ratings for commercial borrowers are significant inputs to the models consumer fico scores are refreshed quarterly and commercial risk ratings are updated annually with select borrowers updated more frequently the macroeconomic trends that have a significant impact on the probability of default vary by portfolio segment exposure at default models estimate the loan balance at the time the borrower stops making payments we use an amortization based formulaic approach to estimate account level ead for all term loans we use portfolio specific methods in each of our revolving product portfolios lgd models estimate the loss we will suffer once a loan is in default account level inputs to lgd models include collateral attributes such as loan to value if we observe limitations in the data or models we use model overlays to make adjustments to model outputs to capture a particular risk or compensate for a known limitation these variables and others may result in actual loan losses that differ from the originally estimated amounts this estimate produced by our models is forwardlooking and requires management to use forecasts about future economic conditions to determine the expected credit loss over the remaining life of an instrument moodys consensus forecast is the source of macroeconomic projections including the interest rate forecasts used in the credit models we use a two year reasonable and supportable period across all products to forecast economic conditions as the length of the life of a financial asset increases these inputs may become impractical to estimate as reasonable and supportable we believe the two year time horizon appropriately aligns with our business planning available industry guidance and reliability of various forecasting services following this two year period in which supportable forecasts can be generated for all modeled loan portfolios we revert expected credit losses to a level that is consistent with our historical information by reverting the macroeconomic variables model inputs to their long run average we revert to historical loss rates for less complex estimation methods for smaller portfolios a four quarter reversion period is used where the macroeconomic variables linearly revert to their long run average following the two year reasonable and supportable period we use a year lookback period for determining long run historical average of the macroeconomic variables we determined the year lookback period is appropriate as it captures the previous two economic cycles as well as the impact from the pandemic the alll is sensitive to various macroeconomic drivers such as gdp and unemployment as well as portfolio attributes such as remaining term outstanding balance risk ratings fico ltv and delinquency status our alll models were designed to capture the correlation between economic and portfolio changes as such evaluating shifts in individual portfolio attributes and macroeconomic variables in isolation may not be indicative of past or future performance it is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one factor or input might affect the overall alll because we consider a wide variety of factors and inputs in estimating the alll changes in the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types and changes in factors and input may be directionally inconsistent such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in others however to consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate economic forecast we compared the modeled quantitative allowance results using a downside economic scenario the maximum difference in the quarterly macroeconomic variables between the base and downside scenarios over the two year reasonable and supportable period includes an approximate decline in gdp annualized growth and an approximate increase in the us unemployment rate the difference between these two scenarios would have driven an increase of approximately for commercial and for the consumer modeled allowance results similarly deteriorating conditions for portfolio factors were also considered by moderately stressing key portfolio drivers relative to the baseline portfolio conditions stressing risk ratings by two grades for commercial loans generates a increase in the commercial modeled allowance results stressing fico by ten points and ltv and utilization by for consumer loans generates a increase in the consumer modeled allowance results note that these analyses demonstrate the sensitivity of the alll to key quantitative assumptions however they are not intended to estimate changes in the overall alll as they do not reflect qualitative factors related to idiosyncratic risk factors changes in current economic conditions that may not be reflected in quantitatively derived results and other relevant factors that must be considered to ensure the alll reflects our best estimate of current expected credit losses table of contents valuation methodologies fair value measurements we measure or monitor many of our assets and liabilities on a fair value basis fair value is generally defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price as opposed to the price that would be paid to acquire the asset or received to assume the liability an entry price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions while management uses judgment when determining the price at which willing market participants would transact when there has been a significant decrease in the volume or level of activity for the asset or liability in relation to normal market activity managements objective is to determine the point within the range of fair value estimates that is most representative of a sale to a thirdparty investor under current market conditions the value to us if the asset or liability were held to maturity is not included in the fair value estimates a fair value measure should reflect the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability including the assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset and the risk of nonperformance fair value is measured based on a variety of inputs fair value may be based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets level valuations if market prices are not available quoted market prices for similar instruments traded in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active or modelbased valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market are used level valuations where observable market data is not available the valuation is generated from model based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market but observable based on our specific data level valuations unobservable assumptions reflect our estimates for assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability valuation techniques typically include option pricing models discounted cash flow models and similar techniques but may also include the use of market prices of assets or liabilities that are not directly comparable to the subject asset or liability the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a fair value higher or lower than carrying value considerable judgment may be involved in determining the amount that is most representative of fair value for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value our policy is to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements for those items where there is an active market in certain cases when market observable inputs for modelbased valuation techniques may not be readily available we are required to make judgments about assumptions market participants would use in estimating the fair value of the financial instrument the models used to determine fair value adjustments are regularly evaluated by management for relevance under current facts and circumstances changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data for example reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable when market data is not available we use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value fair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary measure of accounting fair value is used on a nonrecurring basis to measure certain assets or liabilities including heldtomaturity securities commercial loans held for sale and oreo for impairment or for disclosure purposes in accordance with current accounting guidance impairment analysis also relates to longlived assets and core deposit and other intangible assets an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not likely to be recoverable and exceeds its fair value in determining the fair value management uses models and applies the techniques and assumptions previously discussed see note under the heading fair value measurements and note fair value measurements for a detailed discussion of determining fair value including pricing validation processes goodwill table of contents the valuation and testing methodologies used in our analysis of goodwill impairment are summarized in note under the heading goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is initially recorded as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination goodwill is tested for impairment for all three of our reporting units consumer bank commercial bank and institutional bank we perform our annual impairment test as of october 1st and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests suggest additional testing is needed testing may be either quantitative or qualitative fair value is measured during quantitative tests using a combination of income and market approaches if the fair value of a reporting unit declines below its carrying value an impairment charge will be recognized for any amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting units fair value to the extent that the loss recognized does not exceed the amount of the goodwill allocated to that reporting unit when utilizing the qualitative testing approach key examines numerous qualitative factors such as financial performance market capitalization and other industry and economic trends to conclude whether it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired we monitor impairment indicators for goodwill and other intangible assets and evaluate the carrying amount of these assets quarterly additional information is provided in note goodwill and other intangible assets table of contents derivatives and hedging we primarily use interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk for asset and liability management purposes these derivative instruments modify the interest rate characteristics of specified onbalance sheet assets and liabilities our accounting policies related to derivatives reflect the current accounting guidance which provides that all derivatives should be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value after taking into account the effects of master netting agreements accounting for changes in the fair value ie gains or losses of a particular derivative depends on whether the derivative has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further on the type of hedging relationship the application of hedge accounting requires significant judgment to interpret the relevant accounting guidance as well as to assess hedge effectiveness identify similar hedged item groupings and measure changes in the fair value of the hedged items we believe our methods of addressing these judgments and applying the accounting guidance are consistent with both the guidance and industry practices additional information relating to our use of derivatives is included in note under the heading derivatives and hedging and note derivatives and hedging activities contingent liabilities guarantees and income taxes note commitments contingent liabilities and guarantees summarizes contingent liabilities arising from litigation and contingent liabilities arising from guarantees in various agreements with third parties under which we are a guarantor and the potential effects of these items on the results of our operations we record a liability for the fair value of the obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of a guarantee contingent aspects of guarantees within the scope of asc are assessed a reserve under cecl there is a risk that our actual future payments in the event of a default by the guaranteed party could exceed the recorded amount see note commitments contingent liabilities and guarantees for a comparison of the liability recorded and the maximum potential undiscounted future payments for the various types of guarantees that we had outstanding at december it is not always clear how the internal revenue code and various state tax laws apply to transactions that we undertake in the normal course of business we may record tax benefits and then have those benefits contested by the irs or state tax authorities we have provided tax reserves that we believe are adequate to absorb potential adjustments that such challenges may necessitate however if our judgment later proves to be inaccurate the tax reserves may need to be adjusted which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and capital additionally we conduct quarterly assessments that determine the amount of deferred tax assets that are morelikelythannot to be realized and therefore recorded the available evidence used in connection with these assessments includes a history of pretax income projected future taxable income potential taxplanning strategies and projected future reversals of deferred tax liabilities these assessments are subjective and may change based on these criteria and all available positive and negative evidence we establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when we are unable to conclude it is more likely than not that they will be realized however if our assessments prove incorrect they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which they occur for further information on our accounting for income taxes see note summary of significant accounting policies and note income
