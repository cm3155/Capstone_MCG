whether as a result of new developments or otherwise the risks described in this annual report on form 10k and the safe harbor statement in this report are not the only risks faced by the company risks related to the covid pandemic the covid pandemic resulted in additional risks that could materially adversely affect the companys business financial condition results of operations andor cash flows the virus causing covid was identified in late and spread globally covid pandemic efforts to combat the virus have been complicated by viral variants and uneven access to and acceptance and effectiveness of vaccines globally the pandemic resulted in governments and other authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelter in place orders and business closures these measures have impacted and may continue to impact all or portions of the companys workforce and operations and the operations of customers and dealers although certain restrictions related to the covid pandemic have eased uncertainty continues to exist regarding such measures and potential future measures current material and component shortages have limited and could continue to limit john deeres ability to meet customer demand which could have a material adverse effect on john deeres and the companys financial condition cash flows and results of operations the covid pandemic caused a global recession and the sustainability of the economic recovery observed in remains unclear the covid pandemic has also significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty has caused inflationary pressure in the us and elsewhere and has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets economic uncertainties could continue to affect demand for john deeres products the value of the equipment financed or leased the demand for financing and the financial condition and credit risk of john deere dealers and customers continued uncertainties related to the magnitude duration and persistent effects of the covid pandemic may significantly adversely affect john deeres and the companys business and outlook these uncertainties include among other things the duration and impact of the resurgence in covid cases in any country state or region the emergence contagiousness and threat of new and different strains of virus the availability acceptance and effectiveness of vaccines additional closures or other actions as mandated or otherwise made necessary by governmental authorities including employee vaccine mandates disruptions in the supply chain including those caused by industry capacity constraints material availability and global logistics delays and constraints arising from among other things the transportation capacity of ocean shipping containers and a prolonged delay in resumption of operations by one or more of john deeres key suppliers or the failure of any key supplier an increasingly competitive labor market due to a sustained labor shortage or increased turnover caused by the covid pandemic additional operating costs due to continued remote working arrangements adherence to social distancing guidelines and other covidrelated challenges increased risk of cyberattacks on network connections used in remote working arrangements increased privacyrelated risks due to processing healthrelated personal information legal claims related to alleged exposure to covid on company premises absence of employees due to illness and the impact of the pandemic on the companys customers and john deere dealers these factors and others that are currently unknown or considered immaterial could materially and adversely affect the companys business liquidity results of operations and financial position geopolitical uncertainties international national and regional trade laws regulations and policies particularly those related to or restricting global trade and government farm programs and policies could significantly impair john deeres profitability and growth prospects as the companys acquisition volume of receivables and leases is largely dependent upon the level of retail sales and leases of john deere products these geopolitical uncertainties could also negatively impact the companys profitability and growth prospects international national and regional laws regulations and policies directly or indirectly related to or restricting the import and export of john deeres products services and technology or those of its customers including protectionist policies in particular jurisdictions or for the benefit of favored industries or sectors could harm john deeres global business john deeres profitability and growth prospects are tied directly to the global marketplace restricted access to global markets impairs john deeres ability to export goods and services from its various manufacturing locations around the world and limits the ability to access raw materials and high quality parts and components at competitive prices on a timely basis trade restrictions including withdrawal from or modification of existing trade agreements negotiation of new trade agreements nontariff trade barriers local content requirements and imposition of new or retaliatory tariffs against certain countries or covering certain products including developments in uschina trade relations could limit john deeres ability to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities in international markets and impair john deeres ability to expand the business by offering new technologies products and services these trade restrictions and changes in or uncertainty surrounding global trade policies may affect john deeres competitive position furthermore market access and the ability to export agricultural and forestry commodities is critical to john deeres agricultural and forestry customers policies impacting exchange rates and commodity prices or those limiting the export or import of commodities could have a material adverse effect on the international flow of agricultural and other commodities that may result in a corresponding negative effect on the demand for agricultural and forestry equipment in many areas of the world john deeres agricultural equipment sales could be especially harmed by such policies because farm income strongly influences sales of agricultural equipment around the world furthermore trade restrictions could impede those in developing countries from achieving a higher standard of living which could negatively impact john deeres future growth opportunities arising from increasing global demand for food fuel and infrastructure additionally changes in government farm programs and policies including direct payment and other subsidies can significantly influence demand for agricultural equipment as well as create unequal competition for multinational companies relative to domestic companies embargoes sanctions and export controls imposed by the us and other governments restricting or prohibiting transactions with certain persons or entities including financial institutions to certain countries or regions or involving certain products limit the sales of john deere products embargoes sanctions and export control laws are changing rapidly for certain geographies including with respect to china russia myanmar burma and belarus in particular changing us export controls and sanctions on china as well as other restrictions affecting transactions involving china and chinese parties could affect john deeres ability to collect receivables provide aftermarket and warranty support for john deere equipment and sell products and otherwise impact john deeres reputation and business although john deere and the company have a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of import and export laws and sanctions violations of these laws or sanctions could harm john deeres and the companys reputation and business and may subject john deere or the company to civil and criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on john deeres or the companys results of operations and financial condition greater political economic and social uncertainty and the evolving globalization of businesses could significantly change the dynamics of john deeres and the companys competition customer base and product offerings and impact john deeres and the companys growth opportunities globally john deeres efforts to grow its businesses depend in part upon access to additional geographic markets including but not limited to argentina brazil china india russia and south africa and its success in developing market share and operating profitably in such markets in some cases these countries have greater political and economic volatility greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions and differing local customer product preferences and requirements than john deeres other markets negative market conditions resulting from economic and political uncertainties in these and other countries could reduce customer confidence resulting in declines in demand and increases in delinquencies and default rates which could affect writeoffs and provisions for credit losses operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries exposes john deere and the company to multiple and potentially conflicting cultural practices business practices and legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change and are often complex and difficult to navigate including those related to tariffs and trade barriers investments property ownership rights taxation sanctions and export control requirements repatriation of earnings and advanced technologies the agricultural equipment industry continues to undergo significant changes and is becoming even more competitive through the emergence and expanding global capability of many competitors expanding business operations globally also increases exposure to currency fluctuations which can materially affect john deeres and the companys financial results while john deere maintains a positive corporate image and its brands are widely recognized and valued in its traditional markets the brands are less well known in some emerging markets which could impede john deeres efforts to successfully compete in these markets although john deere is taking measures to adapt to these changing circumstances john deeres and the companys reputation andor business results could be negatively affected should these efforts prove unsuccessful uncertain economic conditions negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for john deeres equipment and services limit access to funding and result in higher funding costs for john deere and the company the demand for the companys and john deeres products and services can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by high unemployment cautious consumer spending lower corporate earnings us budget issues and lower business investment negative or uncertain economic conditions that cause john deeres customers to lack confidence in the general economic outlook can significantly reduce their likelihood of purchasing john deeres equipment as discussed under risks related to the covid pandemic the covid pandemic resulted in additional risks that could materially adversely affect the companys business financial condition results of operations andor cash flows the covid pandemic caused a global recession and significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty sustained negative economic conditions and outlook affect housing starts energy demand and other construction which dampens demand for certain construction equipment john deeres turf operations and its construction and forestry business are dependent on construction activity and general economic conditions decreases in construction activity and housing starts could have a material adverse effect on john deeres and the companys results of operations if negative economic conditions affect the overall farm economy there could be a similar effect on john deeres agricultural equipment sales in addition uncertain or negative outlook with respect to pervasive us fiscal issues as well as general economic conditions and outlook can cause significant changes in market liquidity conditions such changes could impact access to funding and associated funding costs which could reduce the companys earnings and cash flows additionally john deeres and the companys investment management activities could be adversely affected by changes in the equity and bond markets which would negatively affect earnings in addition demand for john deeres and the companys products and services can be significantly reduced by concerns regarding the diverse economic and political circumstances of the individual countries in the eurozone the debt burden of certain eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations the risk that one or more other european union countries could come under increasing pressure to leave the european union or the longterm stability of the euro as a single common currency persistent disparity with respect to the widely varying economic conditions within the individual countries in the eurozone and its implications for the euro as well as market perceptions concerning these and related issues could adversely affect the value of john deeres and the companys eurodenominated assets and obligations have an adverse effect on demand for john deeres and the companys products and services in the eurozone and have an adverse effect on financial markets in europe and globally more specifically it could affect the ability of john deeres and the companys customers suppliers and lenders to finance their respective businesses and access liquidity at acceptable financing costs if at all as well as the availability of supplies and materials and the demand for john deeres products financial risks because the company is subject to interest rate risks changes in interest rates can reduce demand for equipment adversely affect interest margins and limit access to capital markets while increasing borrowing costs rising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity andor the financial condition of the companys customers either or both of which could negatively affect customer demand for john deere equipment and customers ability to repay obligations to the company in addition credit market dislocations could have an impact on funding costs which are very important to the company because such costs affect the companys ability to offer customers competitive financing rates while the company strives to match the interest rate characteristics of its financial assets and liabilities changing interest rates could have an adverse effect on the companys net interest rate marginthe difference between the yield the company earns on its assets and the interest rates the company pays for funding which could in turn affect the companys net interest income and earnings actions by credit rating agencies such as downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks can affect the availability and cost of funding for the company and can increase the companys cost of capital and hurt its competitive position changes in government banking monetary and fiscal policies could have a negative effect on the company policies of the us and other governments regarding banking monetary and fiscal policies intended to promote or maintain liquidity stabilize financial markets andor address local deficit or structural economic issues may not be effective and could have a material impact on the companys customers and markets failure of the us federal government to pass a budget resolution could lead to a us default under its sovereign debt the consequences of which could have significant and unpredictable effects on global financial markets which could in turn negatively affect john deeres and the companys operating results cash flows and financial condition the companys operations and results could also be affected by financial regulatory reform that could have an adverse effect on the company and its customers by limiting their ability to enter into hedging transactions or to finance purchases of john deere products government policies on spending can also affect john deere especially the construction and forestry segment due to the impact of government spending on infrastructure development the companys and john deeres operations including those outside of the united states may also be affected by nonus regulatory reforms being implemented to further regulate nonus financial institutions and markets changes in tax rates tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a negative effect on john deere and the company john deere and the company are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions john deeres domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change john deeres and the companys effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretations if john deeres and the companys effective tax rates were to increase or if the ultimate determination of its taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued john deeres and the companys operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected the companys consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars while certain assets and other reported items are denominated in the currencies of other countries creating currency exchange and translation risk the company operates in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies the company is subject to currency exchange risk to the extent that its costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which it earns revenues additionally the reporting currency for the companys consolidated financial statements is the us dollar certain of the companys assets liabilities expenses and revenues are denominated in other countries currencies those assets liabilities expenses and revenues are translated into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates to prepare the companys consolidated financial statements therefore increases or decreases in exchange rates between the us dollar and those other currencies affect the value of those items as reflected in the companys consolidated financial statements even if their value remains unchanged in their original currencies substantial fluctuations in the value of the us dollar could have a significant impact on the companys results because the company is a financing company negative economic conditions in the financial industry could materially impact the companys operations and financial results negative economic conditions can have an adverse effect on the financial industry in which the company operates the company provides financing for a significant portion of john deeres sales in many of the countries in which the company operates the company is exposed to the risk that customers and others will default on contractual obligations and may experience credit losses that exceed its expectations and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations the companys inability to access funds at costeffective rates to support its financing activities could have a material adverse effect on the companys business the companys liquidity and ongoing profitability depend largely on timely access to capital in order to meet future cash flow requirements and to fund operations and costs associated with engaging in diversified funding activities additionally negative market conditions could reduce customer confidence levels resulting in declines in credit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates which could materially impact the companys writeoffs and provision for credit losses the companys results could be adversely affected by a decrease in the value or higher than estimated returns of equipment on operating lease the company estimates the endoflease term residual value at the inception of the operating leases based on a number of factors including lease term expected hours of usage historical wholesale sale prices return experience intended use of the equipment market dynamics and trends and thirdparty residual guarantees used equipment values may decrease as a result of any one or a combination of factors including market conditions supply of and demand for used equipment and technological advancements in new equipment lower residual value estimates could result in increasing operating lease depreciation impairment losses and losses on the sale of matured operating lease inventory which would decrease the companys earnings the transition away from the london interbank offered rate libor and the adoption of alternative reference rates could adversely affect the companys business and results of operations the company is exposed to liborbased financial instruments primarily relating to debt derivative and receivables transactions that have been entered into previously and remain outstanding the libor benchmark has been subject of national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform in july the uk financial conduct authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for calculation of libor after in november the intercontinental exchange announced that it intends to cease publication of certain libor settings by the end of while continuing to publish overnight and one three six and twelvemonth us dollar libor rates through june however in early the united states federal reserve board and other regulatory bodies issued guidance encouraging banks and other financial market participants to cease entering into new contracts that use us dollar libor as a reference rate as soon as practicable and in any event no later than december these actions may cause libor to perform differently than in the past and libor will likely ultimately cease to exist to facilitate an orderly transition from libor to alternative benchmark rates john deere and the company established an initiative led by internal subject matter experts to assess and mitigate risks associated with the discontinuation of libor as part of this initiative several alternative benchmark rates have been and continue to be evaluated at this time however the effects of the phase out of libor and the adoption of alternative benchmark rates have not been fully determined any new benchmark rate will likely not replicate libor exactly which could affect the companys contracts that mature after a libor cessation date in addition there is uncertainty about how applicable laws the courts or the company will address the replacement of libor with alternative rates on variablerate contracts that do not include or contain unclear alternative rate fallback provisions a failure to properly transition away from libor could expose the company to various financial operational and regulatory risks which could affect the companys results of operations and cash flows uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes may also adversely affect the trading market for the companys securities market conditions john deeres ability to adapt in highly competitive markets could affect its business results of operations and financial condition john deere operates in a variety of highly competitive global and regional markets john deere competes worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products john deere competes on the basis of product performance innovation and quality distribution customer service and price aggressive pricing or other strategies pursued by competitors unanticipated product or manufacturing delays or john deeres failure to price its products competitively could adversely affect john deeres business results of operations and financial condition which could have a negative effect on the companys results john deeres ability to understand its customers specific preferences and requirements and to develop manufacture and market products that meet customer demand could significantly affect its business results john deeres ability to match new product offerings to diverse global customers anticipated preferences for different types and sizes of equipment and various equipment features and functionality at affordable prices is critical to its success this requires a thorough understanding of john deeres existing and potential customers on a global basis failure to deliver quality products that meet customer needs at competitive prices ahead of competitors could have a significant adverse effect on john deeres business which could have a negative effect on the companys results changing worldwide demand for food and different forms of bioenergy could affect the price of farm commodities and consequently the demand for certain john deere equipment and could also result in higher research and development costs related to changing machine fuel requirements changing worldwide demand for farm outputs to meet the worlds growing food and bioenergy demands driven in part by government policies including those related to climate change and a growing world population are likely to result in fluctuating agricultural commodity prices which directly affect sales of agricultural equipment lower agricultural commodity prices directly affect farm incomes which could negatively affect sales of agricultural equipment and result in higher credit losses while higher commodity prices benefit john deeres cropproducing agricultural equipment customers higher commodity prices also could result in greater feed costs for livestock and poultry producers which in turn may result in lower levels of equipment purchased by these customers furthermore changing bioenergy demands may cause farmers to change the types or quantities of the crops they raise with corresponding changes in equipment demands finally changes in governmental policies regulating biofuel utilization could affect commodity demand and commodity prices demand for john deeres dieselfueled equipment and result in higher research and development costs for john deere related to equipment fuel standards these changes could have a negative effect on the companys results data security and privacy risks security breaches and other disruptions to the companys information technology infrastructure could interfere with the companys operations and could compromise the information of the company as well as its customers andor john deere dealers exposing the company to liability that could cause the companys business and reputation to suffer in the ordinary course of business the company relies upon information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including loan application and collection of payments from dealers and other purchasers of john deere equipment the company uses information technology systems to record process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting legal and tax requirements additionally the company collects and stores sensitive data including intellectual property proprietary business information and the proprietary business information of the companys customers and john deere dealers as well as personally identifiable information of the companys customers and employees in data centers which are often owned by third parties and on information technology networks the secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to the companys business operations and strategy despite security measures including a vulnerability disclosure program and business continuity plans the companys information technology networks and infrastructure have been and may be vulnerable to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by cyber criminals or breaches due to employee supplier or dealer error or malfeasance or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware power outages computer viruses telecommunication or utility failures terrorist acts natural disasters or other catastrophic events although the company has not suffered any significant cyber incidents that resulted in a material business impact it has from time to time been the target of malicious cyber threat actors the occurrence of any significant event could compromise the companys networks and the information stored there could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen any such access disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information disruption to the companys operations and damage the companys reputation which could adversely affect the companys business results of operations and financial condition in addition as security threats continue to evolve and increase in frequency and sophistication the company may need to invest additional resources to protect the security of its systems the company is subject to governmental laws regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy and data protection and any inability or perceived inability of the company to address these requirements could adversely affect our business the legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future the company collects personal information and other data as integral parts of its business processes and activities this data is subject to a variety of us and foreign laws and regulations including oversight by various regulatory and other governmental bodies many foreign countries and governmental bodies including the european union and other relevant jurisdictions where the company conducts business have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of personal information and other data obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdictions the european union general data protection regulation and the california consumer privacy act among others impose stringent data protection requirements and provide significant penalties for noncompliance new privacy laws will continue to come into effect around the world in the future any inability or perceived inability to adequately address privacy and data protection concerns even if unfounded or comply with applicable laws regulations policies industry standards contractual obligations or other legal obligations could result in additional cost and liability to the company or company officials damage our reputation inhibit sales and otherwise adversely affect our business human capital risks the companys ability to attract develop engage and retain qualified employees could affect its ability to execute its strategy the companys continued success depends in part on its ability to identify and attract qualified candidates with the requisite education background and experience as well as its ability to develop engage and retain qualified employees failure to attract develop engage and retain qualified employees whether as a result of an insufficient number of qualified applicants difficulty in recruiting new employees or inadequate resources to train integrate and retain qualified employees could impair the companys ability to execute its business strategy and could adversely affect the companys business in addition while the company strives to reduce the impact of the departure of employees the companys operations or ability to execute its business strategy and meet its business objectives may be affected by the loss of employees particularly when departures involve larger numbers of employees such as those the company could experience if a surge occurs in the number of employees voluntarily leaving their jobs similar to that experienced by other employers and industries since higher rates of employee separations may adversely affect the company through decreased employee morale the loss of knowledge of departing employees and the devotion of resources to recruiting and onboarding new employees disputes with labor unions have adversely affected john deeres ability to operate its facilities as well as its financial results many of john deeres production and maintenance employees are represented by labor unions under various collective bargaining agreements with different expiration dates the failure of john deere to successfully renegotiate labor agreements as they expire has from time to time led and could in the future lead to work stoppages or other disputes with labor unions disruptions to john deeres manufacturing and partsdistribution facilities through various forms of labor disputes adversely affect john deere and the company on october after employees represented by the international union united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america uaw failed to approve a new collective bargaining agreement between john deere and the uaw the uaw initiated a labor strike affecting more than workers at john deere facilities across the us which adversely affected john deeres operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal the strike ended after a new collective bargaining agreement was approved on november the uaw strike is expected to have an adverse effect on john deeres results of operations for the three months ending january as a result of reduced production and shipments any strike work stoppage or other dispute with a labor union distracts management from operating the business may displace employees from ordinary job positions to fill in vacant positions may affect john deeres reputation and could materially adversely affect john deeres business which could have a negative effect on the company environmental climate and weather risks unfavorable weather conditions or natural calamities that reduce agricultural production and demand for agriculture and turf equipment could directly and indirectly affect john deeres and the companys business poor or unusual weather conditions particularly during the planting and early growing season can significantly affect the purchasing decisions of john deeres customers particularly the purchasers of agriculture and turf equipment the timing and quantity of rainfall are two of the most important factors in agricultural production insufficient levels of rain prevent farmers from planting new crops and may cause growing crops to die or result in lower yields excessive rain or flooding can prevent planting from occurring at optimal times and may cause crop loss through increased disease or mold growth temperatures outside normal ranges can also cause crop failure or decreased yields and may also affect disease incidence temperature affects the rate of growth maturity and quality of crops natural calamities such as regional floods hurricanes or other storms droughts diseases and pests can have significant negative effects on agricultural and livestock production the resulting negative impact on farm income can strongly affect demand for agricultural equipment and the financial condition and credit risk of our customers and john deeres dealers adverse weather conditions in a particular geographic region particularly during the important spring selling season may adversely affect sales of some turf equipment drought conditions can adversely affect sales of certain mowing equipment and unusually rainy weather can similarly cause lower sales volumes increasingly rigorous environmental health and safety laws and regulations of federal state and local authorities in the us and various regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions apply to john deeres and the companys operations suppliers and customers and enforcement actions or civil litigation related to those requirements could adversely affect john deeres and the companys business results enforcement actions arising from violations of environmental health and safety laws or regulations can lead to investigations and legal costs and result in significant fines or penalties in addition new or more stringent requirements of governmental authorities including with respect to disclosure relating to climate change risks could prevent or restrict john deeres operations or those of john deeres suppliers and customers require significant expenditures to achieve compliance andor give rise to civil or criminal liability further civil litigation on these subjects continues to increase primarily in the us there can be no assurance that violations of such laws andor regulations civil claims for damages to property or personal injury arising from the environmental health or safety impacts of john deeres or the companys operations or those of john deeres suppliers and customers or other civil claims in which john deere or the company becomes a party would not have consequences that result in a material adverse effect on john deeres and the companys business results of operations or financial condition governmental actions designed to address climate change and the emergence of new technologies and business models in connection with the transition to a lowercarbon economy could adversely affect john deere and its customers the physical effects attributed to climate change could further impact john deeres facilities suppliers and customers there is global scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases ghg continue to alter the composition of earths atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue to affect the global climate these considerations may lead to new international national regional or local legislative or regulatory responses various stakeholders including legislators and regulators shareholders and nongovernmental organizations as well as companies in many business sectors including john deere and the company are continuing to look for ways to reduce ghg emissions the regulation of ghg emissions from certain stationary or mobile sources or the imposition of carbon pricing mechanisms could result in additional costs to john deere and the company in the form of taxes or emission allowances facilities improvements and energy costs which would increase john deeres and the companys operating costs through higher utility transportation and materials costs increased input costs such as fuel and fertilizer and compliancerelated costs could also affect customer operations and demand for john deere equipment because the impact of any future climate changerelated legislative regulatory or product standard requirements on john deeres and the companys global businesses and products is dependent on the timing and design of mandates or standards the company is unable to predict their potential impact at this time customer preferences in the markets served by john deere could change as these markets transition to less carbonintensive business models demand for electric agricultural turf and construction equipment could rise the development of alternative farming techniques carbon sequestration technologies and new lowcarbon biofuels could change farmers business models and equipment needs if john deere fails to properly develop or invest in new technologies to meet changing customer demands john deere will be at risk of losing potential sources of revenue which could affect the companys future financial results the potential physical impacts of climate change on john deeres facilities suppliers and customers and therefore on john deeres and the companys operations are highly uncertain and will be particular to the circumstances developing in various geographic regions these may include extreme weather events and longterm changes in temperature levels and water availability these potential physical effects may adversely affect the demand for john deeres products and the financial performance of john deeres and the companys operations legal and regulatory risks the companys global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations the violation of which could expose the company to potential liabilities increased costs and other adverse effects the companys global operations are subject to numerous international federal state and local laws and regulations many of which are complex frequently changing and subject to varying interpretations these laws and regulations cover a broad spectrum of subject areas including advertising antimoney laundering antitrust consumer finance environmental health and safety including proper handling of electronic waste recycling and climate change foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions foreign ownership and investment human rights labor and employment and data privacy these laws may vary substantially within the different markets in which the company operates compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and may further increase the cost of conducting the companys global operations in addition the company must comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act and all applicable foreign anticorruption laws including the uk bribery act which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence government officials or private individuals for the purpose of obtaining or retaining a business advantage regardless of whether those practices are legal or culturally expected in a particular jurisdiction although the company has a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of such laws and regulations there can be no assurance that the companys employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the companys policies and procedures violations of these laws and regulations could result in criminal or civil sanctions and have a materially adverse effect on the companys reputation business results of operations and financial condition changes to existing laws and regulations or changes to how they are interpreted or the implementation of new more stringent laws or regulations could adversely affect the companys business by increasing compliance costs limiting the companys ability to offer a product or service requiring changes to the companys business practices or otherwise making the companys products and services less attractive to customers legislative and regulatory changes and other actions that could potentially affect the companys business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse effects from such measures strategic performance risks the company may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of its business strategies or these benefits may take longer to realize than expected the company may not realize all anticipated benefits of its recent reorganization and the implementation of its operating model within the anticipated timeframe or at all factors that could affect these benefits include the adoption of new job types within the company changing job responsibilities of employees the number of layers of management the ability of employees to embrace change anxiety within the workforce and temporary inefficiencies further the ability of john deere to execute its business strategies in production systems precision technologies and aftermarket support could affect john deeres and the companys results of operations and financial condition
