form 10k there have been no material changes to these policies other than as described below related to the allowance for credit losses as a result of the adoption of asu no during the first quarter of the allowance for credit losses is an estimate of the credit losses expected over the life of the companys receivable portfolio the company measures expected credit losses on a collective basis when similar risk characteristics exist risk characteristics considered by the company include finance product category market geography credit risk and remaining duration receivables that do not share risk characteristics with other receivables in the portfolio are evaluated on an individual basis the company utilizes loss forecast models which are selected based on the size and credit risk of the underlying pool of receivables to estimate expected credit losses transition matrix models are used for large and complex customer receivable pools while weighted average remaining maturity models are used for smaller and less complex customer receivable pools expected credit losses on wholesale receivables are based on historical loss rates adjusted for current economic conditions the modeled expected credit losses are adjusted based on reasonable and supportable forecasts which may include economic indicators such as commodity prices industry equipment sales unemployment rates and housing starts management reviews each models output quarterly and qualitative adjustments are incorporated as necessary while the company believes its allowance is sufficient to provide for losses over the life of its existing receivable portfolio different assumptions or changes in economic conditions would result in changes to the allowance for credit losses and the provision for credit
