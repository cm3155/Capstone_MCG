achieve its leap ambitions trends and economic conditions our volume of receivables and leases is largely dependent upon the level of retail sales and leases of john deere products the level of john deere retail sales and leases is responsive to a variety of economic financial climatic legislative and other factors that influence supply and demand for its products industry sales outlook for fiscal year agriculture and turf construction and forestry john deere trends customers seek to improve profitability productivity and sustainability through technology integration of technology into equipment is a persistent market trend john deeres smart industrial operating model and leap ambitions are intended to capitalize on this market trend the technologies that are the focus of john deeres operating model are incorporated into products within each of john deeres operating segments we expect this trend to persist for the foreseeable future agriculture and turf outlook for john deere expects large and small agricultural equipment sales to be down from levels across all its major markets agricultural fundamentals are expected to continue to moderate in due to rising global grain stocks from excellent growing conditions lower commodity prices elevated interest rates and geopolitical uncertainty demand in the us and canada continues to be affected by declining farm income margins partially offset by stable farm balance sheets the us equipment fleet age is elevated for tractors and in line with historic averages for combines however increases in used inventory levels are impacting purchasing decisions sales of compact utility tractors in the us are forecasted to be down due to higher interest rates partially offset by small and midtractor tailwinds from improving dairy and livestock fundamentals in europe volatile weather conditions continue to drive uncertainty about crop yields and along with elevated input costs are impacting demand in the region while the dairy and livestock sector remains steady due to stronger pricing and lower feed costs construction and forestry outlook for construction equipment industry sales are forecasted to be down from levels benefits from strong us infrastructure spending and increasing manufacturing investment levels are expected to partially offset declines in housing starts decreases in rental purchases low levels of commercial real estate construction and the effect of elevated inventory levels roadbuilding demand remains strong in the us largely offset by continuing softness in europe company trends our net income for fiscal year is expected to be slightly higher than fiscal year primarily due to income earned on a higher average portfolio lower dealer financing incentives and favorable discrete tax items partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses and less favorable financing spreads agricultural market business cycle the agricultural market is affected by various factors including commodity prices acreage planted crop yields and government policies these factors affect farmers income and may result in lower demand for equipment we may experience higher receivable writeoffs and losses on equipment on operating leases during unfavorable market conditions interest rates central bank policy interest rates increased in and have remained elevated most of our receivables and leases with retail customers are fixed rate while our wholesale receivables generally are variable rate this receivable and lease portfolio is financed with fixed and variable rate borrowings we manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations by matching the interest rate characteristics of our portfolio with our funding sources we also enter into interest rate swap agreements to match our interest rate exposure rising interest rates have historically impacted our borrowings sooner than the benefit is realized from our receivable and lease portfolio as a result we experienced aftertax less favorable financing spreads in the first nine months of compared to we expect to continue experiencing spread compression in higher interest rates are driven by factors outside of our control and as a result we cannot reasonably foresee when these conditions will subside other items of concern and uncertainties other items that could impact our results are global and regional political conditions including the ongoing war between russia and ukraine and the conflict in the middle east economic tax and trade policies new or retaliatory tariffs capital market disruptions foreign currency and capital control policies regulations and legislation regarding right to repair or right to modify weather conditions marketplace adoption and monetization of technologies we have invested in john deeres and our ability to strengthen our digital capabilities automation autonomy and alternative power technologies workforce reductions impact on employee retention morale and institutional knowledge changes in demand and pricing for new and used equipment delays or disruptions in john deeres supply chain significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates volatility in the

finance income we stop accruing finance income once receivables are considered nonperforming which generally occurs once receivables are days past due an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the estimated credit losses expected over the life of the receivable portfolio we measure expected credit losses on a collective basis when similar risk characteristics exist risk characteristics include product category market geography credit risk and remaining balance receivables that do not share risk characteristics with other receivables in the portfolio are evaluated on an individual basis nonperforming receivables are included in the estimate of expected credit losses while we believe our allowance is sufficient to provide for losses over the life of our existing receivable portfolio different assumptions or changes in economic conditions would result in changes to the allowance for credit losses and the provision for credit losses see note for additional information related to the allowance for credit losses deposits held from dealers and merchants amounted to at july compared with at october and at july these balances primarily represent the aggregate dealer retail note and lease deposits from individual john deere dealers to which losses from retail notes and leases originating from the respective dealers can be charged recoveries from dealer deposits are recognized in other income when the dealers deposit account is charged we also utilize other freestanding credit enhancements such as credit insurance and bank guarantees to mitigate credit risk recoveries from these freestanding credit enhancements are generally recognized when the associated credit loss is recorded recoveries from dealer deposits and other freestanding credit enhancements recorded in other income were in the third quarter and for the first nine months of compared with and for the same periods last year respectively the increases were driven by expected recoveries on
