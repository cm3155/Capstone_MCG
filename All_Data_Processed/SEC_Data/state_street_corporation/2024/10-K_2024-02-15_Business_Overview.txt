clients and potential employees improves brand recognition and builds public trust supervision and regulation we are registered with the federal reserve as a bank holding company pursuant to the bank holding company act of the bank holding company act generally limits the activities in which bank holding companies and their nonbanking subsidiaries may engage to managing or controlling banks and to a range of activities that are considered to be closely related to banking bank holding companies that have elected to be treated as financial holding companies such as the parent company may engage in a broader range of activities considered to be financial in nature the regulatory limits on our activities also apply to nonbanking entities that we are deemed to control for purposes of the bank holding company act which may include companies of which we own or control or more of a class of voting shares the federal reserve may order a bank holding company to terminate any activity or its ownership or control of a nonbanking subsidiary if the federal reserve finds that the activity ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety soundness or stability of a banking subsidiary or is inconsistent with sound banking principles or statutory purposes the bank holding company act also requires a bank holding company to obtain prior approval of the federal reserve before it acquires substantially all the assets of any bank or ownership or control of more than of the voting shares of any bank the parent company has elected to be treated as a financial holding company and as such may engage in a broader range of nonbanking activities than permitted for bank holding companies and their subsidiaries that have not elected to become financial holding companies financial holding companies may engage directly or indirectly either de novo or by acquisition in activities that are defined by the federal reserve to be financial in nature provided that the financial holding company gives the federal reserve afterthefact notice of the new activities activities defined to be financial in nature include but are not limited to providing financial or investment advice underwriting dealing in or making markets in securities making merchant banking investments subject to significant limitations and any activities previously found by the federal reserve to be closely related to banking in order to maintain our status as a financial holding company we and each of our us depository institution subsidiaries are expected to be well capitalized and well managed as defined in applicable regulations and determined in part by the results of regulatory examinations and must comply with community reinvestment act obligations failure to maintain these standards may result in restrictions on our activities and may ultimately permit the federal reserve to take enforcement actions against us and restrict our ability to engage in activities defined to be financial in nature state street corporation in response to the financial crisis as well as other factors such as technological and market changes both the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which our business is subject has increased regulatory enforcement and fines have also increased across the banking and financial services sector many of these changes have occurred as a result of the doddfrank act and its implementing regulations most of which are now in place subsequently in the egrrcpa was enacted the egrrcpas revisions to the us financial regulatory framework have altered certain laws and regulations applicable to us and other major financial services firms changes in key personnel at the federal banking agencies that regulate such banking organizations including the federal reserve the fdic and the occ us agencies may result in increased prudential and conduct oversight more extensive regulatory requirements changing interpretations of existing rules and guidelines and potentially more stringent enforcement and more severe penalties irrespective of any regulatory change we expect that our business will remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision in addition increased regulatory requirements and initiatives have been and are being implemented globally with respect to financial institutions including the implementation of the basel iii rule refer to regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity standards in this supervision and regulation section and under capital in financial condition in our managements discussion and analysis in this form 10k for a discussion of basel iii as well as the us agencies proposed rule regarding the basel iii endgame the capital requirements directive and capital requirements regulation and the eu digital operational resilience act dora as well as proposals for amending the alternative investment fund managers directive and under the capital markets union action plan many aspects of our business are subject to regulation by other us federal and state governmental and regulatory agencies and selfregulatory organizations including securities exchanges and by nonus governmental and regulatory agencies and selfregulatory organizations some aspects of our public disclosure corporate governance principles and internal control systems are subject to the sarbanesoxley act of sox the doddfrank act and regulations and rules of the sec and the new york stock exchange regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity standards basel iii rule we are subject to the basel iii framework basel iii rule in the united states the provisions of the basel iii rule related to minimum capital requirements capital buffers and deductions and adjustments to regulatory capital were fully implemented as of january we are also subject to the market risk capital rule as implemented by us banking regulators as required by the doddfrank act we are subject to a capital floor also referred to as the collins amendment in the assessment of our regulatory capital adequacy thus our riskbased capital ratios for regulatory assessment purposes are the lower of each ratio calculated under the standardized approach and the advanced approaches we are also subject to the capital conservation buffer and the countercyclical capital buffer described below in this supervision and regulation section on july the us agencies issued a proposed rule to implement the basel iii endgame basel iii endgame proposal for large banks and separately proposed revisions to the us gsib capital surcharge framework gsib surcharge proposal the basel iii endgame proposal would among other things eliminate the advanced approaches for monitoring capital adequacy in favor of a new standardized expanded riskbased approach that would include unlike the current standardized approach operational risk and cva risk rwa components and would also replace the existing market risk rule with the new fundamental review of the trading book frtb framework the gsib surcharge proposal would among other things measure the gsib surcharge in more granular increments as opposed to the increments that currently apply the basel iii endgame proposal would maintain the current basel iii rules dualrequirement structure whereby we and state street bank would be required to calculate our riskbased capital ratios under both the expanded riskbased approach and the standardized approach in addition the proposal would modify the existing standardized approach by requiring that the proposed new market risk standards frtb also be applied in the standardized approach state street corporation the basel iii endgame proposal would apply the scb and gsib surcharge to the riskbased capital requirements calculated under both the expanded riskbased approach and the existing standardized approach the basel iii endgame proposal includes an effective date of july with threeyear transition arrangements until the requirements are fully phased in on july the gsib surcharge proposal is set to be implemented two calendar quarters after the date of the adoption of the final rule which is currently to be determined based on our current understanding of the basel iii endgame proposal we estimate that if the expanded riskbased approach had been applied on a fully phasedin basis as of december and in the absence of taking any actions to mitigate its impact our expanded riskbased approach rwa as of that date would have been approximately higher than our actual standardized approach rwa as of that date any estimate of how the expanded riskbased approach may impact us is subject to uncertainty as actual results may differ from the anticipated results and may be materially affected by and dependent on a range of factors including business performance future capital actions the results of future supervisory stress tests and interpretations including changes in interpretations of and potential modifications by the us agencies to the proposal risk weighted assets the existing basel iii rule provides two frameworks for the calculation of rwa for purposes of bank regulatory compliance the standardized approach and the advanced approaches which are applicable to advanced approaches banking organizations like us the standardized approach prescribes standardized risk weights for certain on and offbalance sheet exposures in the calculation of rwa the advanced approaches consist of the advanced internal ratingsbased approach airb used for the calculation of rwa related to credit risk and the advanced measurement approach ama used for the calculation of rwa related to operational risk in november the us agencies issued a final rule that among other things implements the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk saccr a methodology for calculating the exposure amount for derivative contracts under the final rule beginning on january we had the option to use the saccr or the internal model methodology imm to measure the exposure amount of our cleared and uncleared derivative transactions under our advanced approaches calculation we have elected to use the saccr for purposes of our advanced approaches capital calculations since january we are required to determine the amount of these exposures under our standardized approach capital calculation using the saccr minimum riskbased capital requirements among other things the basel iii rule as amended requires a minimum cet1 riskbased capital ratio of and a minimum slr of for advanced approaches banking organizations a minimum tier riskbased capital ratio of a minimum total capital ratio of and the stress capital and countercyclical capital buffers referenced below as well as a gsib surcharge and the enhanced slr which acts as an slr buffer described in capital in financial condition in our managements discussion and analysis in this form 10k under the basel iii rule our total regulatory capital is composed of three tiers cet1 capital tier capital which includes cet1 capital and tier capital the total of tier and tier capital adjusted as applicable is referred to as total regulatory capital cet1 capital is composed of core capital elements such as qualifying common shareholders equity and related surplus plus retained earnings and the cumulative effect of foreign currency translation plus net unrealized gains losses on debt and equity securities classified as afs less treasury stock and less goodwill and other intangible assets net of related deferred tax liabilities tier capital is composed of cet1 capital plus additional tier capital instruments which for us includes four series of preferred equity outstanding as of december tier capital includes certain eligible subordinated longterm debt instruments total regulatory capital consists of tier capital and tier capital certain other items if applicable must be deducted from tier and tier capital including certain investments in the capital of unconsolidated banking financial and insurance entities and the amount of expected credit losses that exceeds recorded allowances for loan and other credit losses expected credit losses are calculated for wholesale credit exposures by formula in conformity with the basel iii rule state street corporation gsib surcharge the eight us bank holding companies deemed to be gsibs including us are required to calculate the gsib surcharge annually according to two methods and be bound by the higher of the two method assesses systemic importance based upon five equallyweighted components size interconnectedness complexity crossjurisdictional activity and substitutability or method alters the calculation from method by factoring in a shortterm wholesale funding score in place of substitutability and applying a fixed coefficient to each of the five components method is the binding methodology for us as of december our current gsib surcharge through december is based upon preliminary calculations using data as of december we currently anticipate that our surcharge will remain at through december however that calculation has not yet been finalized and is subject to many financial balance sheet market and other factors and consequently there is a risk that a higher gsib surcharge of will result from the final calculation as noted above our gsib surcharge must be calculated annually and yearoveryear changes in our method or method gsib scores may therefore result in changes to our gsib surcharge if our method or method score changes yearoveryear such that we would become subject to a higher surcharge the higher surcharge would not become effective for two years from the as of date eg a higher surcharge calculated as of december would not become effective until january if however our method or method score changes yearoveryear such that we would become subject to a lower surcharge we would be subject to the lower surcharge beginning one full year from the as of date eg a lower surcharge calculated as of december would become effective january stress capital buffer on march the us agencies issued the scb final rule that replaced under the standardized approach the fixed capital conservation buffer with an scb calculated as the difference between the institutions starting and lowest projected cet1 ratio under the severely adverse scenario of the federal reserves supervisory stress test plus planned common stock dividend payments as a percentage of rwa from the fourth through seventh quarter of the supervisory stress testing planning horizon based on our results from the supervisory stress test our scb for the period of october through september is set at the prescribed minimum of of rwa for additional information about the scb final rule refer to capital planning stress tests and dividends in this supervision and regulation section under the scb final rule a banking organization would be able to make capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments without specified quantitative limitations although subject to other potential regulatory constraints such as supervisory limitations as long as it maintains its required scb plus the applicable gsib surcharge plus any potentially applicable countercyclical capital buffer over the minimum required riskbased capital ratios and as long as it satisfies all leverage based capital requirements and buffers from time to time under certain economic conditions banking regulators may establish a minimum countercyclical capital buffer up to a maximum of of total rwa the countercyclical capital buffer was initially set by banking regulators at zero and has not been increased since its inception assuming a countercyclical buffer of the minimum capital ratios as of january including a capital conservation buffer and an scb of for advanced and standardized approaches respectively and a gsib surcharge of are for cet1 capital for tier riskbased capital and for total riskbased capital in order for us to make capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments without limitation leverage ratios we are subject to a minimum tier leverage ratio and slr the tier leverage ratio is based on tier capital and adjusted quarterly average onbalance sheet assets the tier leverage ratio differs from the slr primarily in that the denominator of the tier leverage ratio is a quarterly average of onbalance sheet assets while the slr additionally includes offbalance sheet exposures we must maintain a minimum tier leverage ratio of we are also subject to a minimum slr of and as a us gsib we must maintain a slr buffer in order to avoid any limitations on distributions to shareholders and discretionary bonus payments to certain executives if we do not maintain this buffer limitations on these distributions and discretionary bonus payments would be increasingly stringent based upon the extent of the shortfall in november pursuant to the egrrcpa the us agencies adopted a final rule that excludes central bank deposits from a custodial banking organizations total leverage exposure for purpose of calculating the slr this exclusion is not applicable to total leverage exposure under the calculation of tier leverage this exclusion is equal to the lesser of i the total amount of funds the custodial banking organization and its consolidated subsidiaries have state street corporation on deposit at qualifying central banks and ii the total amount of client funds on deposit at the custodial banking organization that are linked to fiduciary or custodial and safekeeping accounts the rule became effective on april for the quarter ended december we excluded billion of average balances held on deposit at central banks from the denominator used in the calculation of our slr based on this custodial banking exclusion the tlac and ltd that state street is required to hold under slrbased requirements reflect the exclusion of certain central bank balances as a consequence of the rule the saccr final rule that went into effect for us on january also requires us to incorporate the saccr into the calculation of our total leverage exposure for the purpose of calculating slr total lossabsorbing capacity the federal reserve has implemented rules on tlac ltd and clean holding company requirements for us domiciled gsibs such as us the requirements are intended to improve the resiliency and resolvability of certain us banking organizations through enhanced prudential standards the tlac rule imposes external tlac requirements ie combined eligible tier regulatory capital and ltd separate external ltd requirements and clean holding company requirements that impose restrictions on certain types of liabilities and limit nontlac related third party liabilities to of external tlac among other things the tlac rule requires us to comply with minimum requirements for external tlac and external ltd specifically since january we must hold combined eligible tier regulatory capital and ltd in the amount equal to the greater of of total rwa minimum plus a capital conservation buffer plus a gsib surcharge calculated for these purposes under method of plus any applicable countercyclical buffer which is currently and of total leverage exposure minimum plus the enhanced slr buffer of as defined by the slr rule and qualifying external ltd equal to the greater of of rwa minimum plus a gsib surcharge calculated for these purposes under method of and of total leverage exposure as defined by the slr rule additionally certain large banking organizations such as us and state street bank are required to make deductions from regulatory capital for investments in certain unsecured debt instruments issued by bank holding companies and us intermediate holding companies of foreign banks that are subject to the federal reserves tlac and ltd requirements as well as foreign gsibs liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio in addition to capital standards the basel iii framework introduced two quantitative liquidity standards the lcr and the nsfr we are subject to the rule issued by the us agencies implementing the bcbss lcr in the united states the lcr is intended to promote the shortterm resilience of internationally active banking organizations like us to improve the banking industrys ability to absorb shocks arising from market stress over a calendar day period and improve the measurement and management of liquidity risk the lcr measures an institutions hqla against its net cash outflows under a prescribed stress environment we report lcr to the federal reserve daily and are required to calculate and maintain an lcr that is equal to or greater than in addition we publicly disclose certain qualitative and quantitative information about our lcr consistent with the quarterly disclosure requirements of the federal reserves final rule compliance with the lcr has required that we maintain an investment portfolio that contains an adequate amount of hqla in general hqla investments generate a lower investment return than other types of investments resulting in a negative impact on our nii and our nim in addition the level of hqla we are required to maintain under the lcr is dependent upon our client relationships and the nature of services we provide which may change over time deposits resulting from certain services provided operational deposits are treated as more resilient during periods of stress than other deposits as a result if balances of operational deposits increased relative to our total client deposit base we would expect to require less hqla in order to maintain our lcr conversely if balances of operational deposits decreased relative to our total client deposit base we would expect to require more hqla on may the us agencies issued a rule that modified the lcr rule to neutralize the impact on lcr of the advances made by the mmlf and paycheck protection liquidity facility program and the exposures securing such advances in october the us agencies issued a final rule implementing the bcbss nsfr in the us the final rule requires large banking organizations to maintain an amount of available stable funding which is a weighted measure of a companys funding sources over a oneyear time horizon calculated by applying standardized weightings to the companys equity and liabilities based on their expected stability that is no less than the amount of required stable funding which is calculated by applying standardized state street corporation weightings to assets derivatives exposures and certain other items based on their liquidity characteristics as a us gsib we are required to maintain an nsfr that is equal to or greater than in addition in we began publicly disclosing certain qualitative and quantitative information about our nsfr consistent with the semiannual disclosure requirements of the federal reserves final rule additional information about our nsfr is provided in asset liquidity in liquidity risk management in our managements discussion and analysis in this form 10k capital planning stress tests and dividends pursuant to the doddfrank act in march the federal reserve adopted capital planning and stress test requirements for large bank holding companies including us which form part of the federal reserves annual stress testing and capital planning framework the federal reserve conducts its own stress tests of our business operations using supervisory models referred to as supervisory stress tests the results of which it uses to calibrate our annual scb subject to a minimum of in addition under the federal reserves capital plan rule we must conduct periodic stress testing of our business operations and submit an annual capital plan to the federal reserve taking into account the results of separate stress tests designed by us and by the federal reserve the federal reserve conducts a qualitative assessment of our capital plan as part of the annual supervisory process known as ccar to evaluate the strength of our capital planning practices including our ability to identify measure and determine the appropriate amount of capital for our risks and controls and governance supporting capital planning the federal reserves final scb rule to integrate its annual capital planning and stress testing requirements with certain ongoing regulatory capital requirements applies to certain bank holding companies including us the final rule introduced an scb and related changes to the capital planning and stress testing processes the standardized approach scb equals the greater of i and ii the maximum decline in our cet1 capital ratio under the severely adverse scenario over the supervisory stress test measurement period plus the ratio of a the sum of the dollar amount of our planned common stock dividends for the fourth through seventh quarters of the supervisory stress test projection period to b our projected rwa for the quarter in which our projected cet1 capital ratio reaches its minimum in the supervisory stress test riskedbased regulatory capital requirements under the standardized approach include the scb as summarized above as well as our gsib capital surcharge and any applicable countercyclical capital buffer the final rule made related changes to capital planning and stress testing processes for bank holding companies subject to the scb requirement in particular the final rule assumes that bank holding companies maintain a constant level of assets and rwa throughout the supervisory stress test projection period in addition under the final rule the supervisory stress test no longer assumes that bank holding companies make all nine quarters of planned capital distributions under stress although the scb incorporates the dollar amount of four quarters of planned common stock dividends as described above the final rule did not change regulatory capital requirements under the advanced approaches the tier leverage ratio or the slr our scb requirement was for the period from october through september on june we were notified by the federal reserve of the results from the supervisory stress test our scb calculated under the supervisory stress test was well below the minimum resulting in an scb at that floor which went into effect starting october and will remain effective through september although the final scb rule changed the effects of the ccar and supervisory stress test processes so that the scb rather than ccar is the source of our stressbased capital requirements we continue to be subject to ccars capital plan requirements and the supervisory assessment of our capital planning activities under the capital planning requirements our annual capital plan must include a description of all of our planned capital actions over a ninequarter planning horizon including any capital qualifying instruments any capital distributions such as payments of dividends on or repurchases of our stock and any similar action that the federal reserve determines could affect our consolidated capital the capital plan must include a discussion of how we will maintain capital above the minimum regulatory capital ratios including the minimum ratios under the basel iii rule and serve as a source of strength to state street bank under supervisory stress scenarios changes in our strategy merger or acquisition activity or unanticipated uses of capital could result in a change in our capital plan and its associated capital actions including capital raises or modifications to planned capital actions such as repurchases of our stock and may require resubmission of the capital plan to the federal reserve if among other reasons we would not meet our regulatory capital requirements after making the proposed capital distribution in addition to its stress testing and capital planning requirements the federal reserve has the authority to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends the repurchase of common stock or other capital actions that reduce capital by the banking state street corporation organizations it supervises including the parent company and state street bank if in the federal reserves opinion the capital action would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light ofthe financial condition of the banking organization all of these policies and other requirements could affect our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our stock or require us to provide capital assistance to state street bank and any other banking subsidiary our common stock and other stock dividends including the declaration timing and amount thereof remain subject to consideration and approval by our board of directors at the relevant times the federal reserve under the doddfrank act previously required us to conduct semiannual state streetrun stress tests and to publicly disclose the summary results of our state streetrun stress tests under the severely adverse economic scenario we are also required to undergo an annual supervisory stress test conducted by the federal reserve the egrrcpa modifies certain aspects of these stresstesting requirements reducing the number of scenarios in the federal reserves supervisory stress test from three to two and modifying our obligation to perform companyrun stresstests from semiannually to annually the federal reserve adopted a final rule in october that among other things implemented this modification enhanced prudential standards the doddfrank act as amended by the egrrcpa establishes a systemic risk regime to which large bank holding companies with billion or more in consolidated assets such as us are subject the federal reserve is required to tailor the application of the enhanced prudential standards to bank holding companies based on their size complexity risk profile and other factors us gsibs such as us are subject to the most stringent requirements including heightened capital leverage liquidity and risk management requirements and singlecounterparty credit limits sccl the fsoc can recommend prudential standards reporting and disclosure requirements for sifis to the federal reserve and must approve any finding by the federal reserve that a financial institution poses a grave threat to financial stability and must undertake mitigating actions the fsoc is also empowered to designate systemically important payment clearing and settlement activities of financial institutions subjecting them to prudential supervision and regulation and assisted by the office of financial research within the us department of the treasury can gather data and reports from financial institutions including us under the federal reserves enhanced prudential standards regulation under the doddfrank act as amended by the egrrcpa we are required to comply with various liquidityrelated risk management standards and maintain a liquidity buffer of unencumbered highly liquid assets based on the results of internal liquidity stress testing this liquidity buffer is in addition to other liquidity requirements such as the lcr and the nsfr the regulations also establish requirements and responsibilities for our risk committee and mandate risk management standards in the federal reserve finalized rules that established sccl for large banking organizations us gsibs including us are subject to a limit of of tier capital for aggregate net credit exposures to any major counterparty defined to include other us gsibs foreign gsibs and nonbank sifis supervised by the federal reserve in addition we are subject to a limit of of tier capital for aggregate net credit exposures to any other unaffiliated counterparty the final sccl rules became effective for us on january the federal reserve has established a rule that imposes contractual requirements on certain qualified financial contracts to which us gsibs including us and their subsidiaries are parties under the rule certain qualified financial contracts generally must expressly provide that transfer restrictions and default rights against a us gsib or subsidiary of a us gsib are limited to the same extent as they would be under the federal deposit insurance act and title ii of the doddfrank act and their implementing regulations in addition certain qualified financial contracts may not among other things permit the exercise of any crossdefault right against a us gsib or subsidiary of a us gsib based on an affiliates entry into insolvency resolution or similar proceedings subject to certain creditor protections the systemicrisk regime also provides that for us gsibs deemed to pose a grave threat to us financial stability the federal reserve upon an fsoc vote must limit that institutions ability to merge restrict its ability to offer financial products require it to terminate activities impose conditions on activities or as a last resort require it to dispose of assets upon a grave threat determination by the fsoc the federal reserve must issue rules that require financial institutions subject to the systemicrisk regime to maintain a debttoequity ratio of no more than to if the fsoc considers it necessary to mitigate the risk of the grave threat the federal reserve also has the ability to establish further standards including those regarding contingent capital enhanced public disclosures and limits on shortterm debt including offbalance sheet exposures as a gsib we are subject to enhanced supervision and prudential standards our status as a gsib has also resulted in heightened expectations of our us and international regulators with respect to state street corporation our capital and liquidity management and our compliance and risk oversight programs these heightened expectations have increased our regulatory compliance costs including personnel technology and systems as well as significant additional implementation and related costs to enhance our regulatory compliance programs regulatory compliance requirements are anticipated to remain at least at the elevated levels we have experienced over the past several years failure to meet current and future regulatory capital requirements could subject us to a variety of enforcement actions including the termination of state street banks deposit insurance by the fdic and to certain restrictions on our business including those that are described above in this supervision and regulation section not all of our competitors have similarly been designated as systemically important nor are all of them subject to the same degree of regulation as a bank or financial holding company and therefore some of our competitors may not be subject to the same additional capital requirements for additional information about our regulatory capital position and our regulatory capital adequacy as well as current and future regulatory capital requirements refer to capital in financial condition in our managements discussion and analysis and note to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k the volcker rule we are subject to the volcker rule and implementing regulations the volcker rule prohibits banking entities including us and our affiliates from engaging in certain prohibited proprietary trading activities as defined in the volcker rule regulations subject to exemptions for marketmaking related activities riskmitigating hedging underwriting and certain other activities the volcker rule also requires banking entities to either restructure or divest certain ownership interests in and relationships with covered funds as such terms are defined in the volcker rule regulations the volcker rule regulations require banking entities to establish extensive programs designed to promote compliance with the restrictions of the volcker rule we have established a compliance program that we believe complies with the volcker rule regulations as currently in effect our compliance program restricts our ability in the future to service certain types of funds in particular covered funds for which state street global advisors acts as an advisor and certain types of trustee relationships consequently volcker rule compliance entails both the cost of a compliance program and loss of certain revenue and future opportunities recovery and resolution planning under section 165d of the doddfrank act we are required to submit a resolution plan on a biennial basis jointly to the federal reserve and the fdic as used in this recovery and resolution planning section the agencies the purpose of our resolution plan is to describe our preferred resolution strategy and to demonstrate that we have the resources and capabilities to execute on that strategy in the event of major financial distress through resolution planning we seek to maintain our role as a key infrastructure provider within the financial system while minimizing risk to the financial system the final rule published on november requires us gsibs to file a full resolution plan and a targeted resolution plan on an alternating basis in the relevant submission years we submitted our updated 165d resolution plan by july under the 165d rule results are due from the agencies by july unless the deadline is extended due to extenuating circumstances our next 165d resolution plan submission to the agencies is due by july in the event of material financial distress our preferred resolution strategy is the single point of entry spoe strategy the spoe strategy provides that prior to the bankruptcy of the parent company and pursuant to a support agreement among the parent company ssif a direct subsidiary of the parent company our beneficiary entities as defined below and certain of our other entities ssif is obligated up to its available resources to recapitalize andor provide liquidity to state street bank and the other entities benefiting from such capital andor liquidity support collectively with state street bank beneficiary entities in amounts designed to prevent the beneficiary entities from themselves entering into resolution proceedings following the recapitalization of or provision of liquidity to the beneficiary entities the parent company would enter into a bankruptcy proceeding under the us bankruptcy code the beneficiary entities and our other subsidiaries would be transferred to a newly organized holding company held by a reorganization trust for the benefit of the parent companys claimants under the support agreement the parent company prefunded ssif by contributing certain of its assets primarily its liquid assets cash deposits investments in intercompany debt investments in marketable securities and other cash and noncash equivalent investments to ssif at the time it entered into the support agreement and will continue to contribute such assets to the extent available on an ongoing basis in consideration for these contributions ssif has agreed in the support agreement to provide capital and liquidity support to the parent company and all of the beneficiary state street corporation entities in accordance with the parent companys capital and liquidity policies under the support agreement the parent company is only permitted to retain cash needed to meet its upcoming obligations and to fund expected expenses during a potential bankruptcy proceeding ssif has provided the parent company with a committed credit line and issued and may issue one or more promissory notes to the parent company the parent company funding notes that together are intended to allow the parent company to continue to meet its obligations throughout the period prior to the occurrence of a recapitalization event which is defined as the earlier occurrence of one or more capital and liquidity thresholds being breached or the authorization by the parent companys board of directors for the parent company to commence bankruptcy proceedings the support agreement does not obligate ssif to maintain any specific level of resources and ssif may not have sufficient resources to implement the spoe strategy in the event a recapitalization event occurs the obligations outstanding under the parent company funding notes would automatically convert into or be exchanged for capital contributed to ssif the obligations of the parent company and ssif under the support agreement are secured through a security agreement that grants a lien on the assets that the parent company and ssif would use to fulfill their obligations under the support agreement to the beneficiary entities ssif is a distinct legal entity separate from the parent company and the parent companys other affiliates in accordance with our policies we are required to monitor on an ongoing basis the capital and liquidity needs of state street bank and our other beneficiary entities to support this process we have established a trigger framework that identifies key actions that would need to be taken or decisions that would need to be made if certain events tied to our financial condition occur the trigger thresholds are set at levels intended to provide for the availability of sufficient capital and liquidity to enable an orderly resolution without extraordinary government support that results in us emerging from resolution as a stabilized institution with market confidence restored upon the occurrence of a recapitalization event ssif would not be authorized to provide any further liquidity to the parent company the parent company would be required to contribute to ssif any remaining assets it is required to contribute to ssif under the support agreement which specifically exclude amounts designated to fund expected expenses during a potential bankruptcy proceeding ssif would be required to provide capital and liquidity support to the beneficiary entities to support such entities continued operation to the extent of its available resources and consistent with the support agreement and the parent company would be expected to commence chapter proceedings under the us bankruptcy code no person or entity other than a party to the support agreement should rely on any of our affiliates being or remaining a beneficiary entity or receiving capital or liquidity support pursuant to the support agreement including in evaluating any of our entities from a creditors perspective or determining whether to enter into a contractual relationship with any of our entities state street bank is also required to submit periodically to the fdic a plan for resolution in the event of its failure referred to as an idi plan we submitted our last idi plan by december in alignment with changes to the idi plan requirements as set out in the june policy statement issued by the fdic the fdic

total assets which is the category applicable to state street additionally we are required to submit a recovery plan periodically to the federal reserve the plan includes strategies designed to respond to stress factors at an early stage and stabilize and maintain operational continuity and market confidence our recovery strategies are intended to be implemented before our resolution plan is triggered we are also engaged in recovery planning requirements in certain international jurisdictions where we operate orderly liquidation authority under the doddfrank act certain financial companies including bank holding companies such as the parent company and certain covered subsidiaries can be subjected to the orderly liquidation authority for the fdic to be appointed as our receiver twothirds of the fdic board and twothirds of the federal reserve board must recommend appointment and the us treasury secretary in consultation with the us president must then make certain extraordinary financial distress and systemic risk determinations absent such actions we as a bank holding company would remain subject to the us bankruptcy code the orderly liquidation authority went into effect in and rulemaking is proceeding incrementally with some regulations now finalized and others planned but not yet proposed if the fdic were appointed as the receiver of the parent company pursuant to the orderly liquidation authority the fdic would have considerable powers to resolve the parent company including the power to remove officers and directors responsible for the parent companys failure and to appoint new directors and state street corporation officers the power to assign assets and liabilities to a third party or bridge financial company without the need for creditor consent or prior court review the ability to differentiate among similarly situated creditors subject to a minimum recovery right to receive at least what they would have received in bankruptcy liquidation and broad powers to administer the claims process to determine distributions from the assets of the receivership to creditors not transferred to a third party or bridge financial institution in the fdic released its proposed spoe strategy for resolution of a sifi under the orderly liquidation authority the fdics release outlines how it would likely use its powers under the orderly liquidation authority to resolve a sifi by placing its toptier us holding company in receivership and keeping its operating subsidiaries open and out of insolvency proceedings by transferring the operating subsidiaries to a new bridge holding company recapitalizing the operating subsidiaries and imposing losses on the shareholders and creditors of the holding company in

discussion and analysis in this form 10k the fdic is required to determine whether and to what extent adjustments to the assessment base are appropriate for custody banks that satisfy specified institutional eligibility criteria the fdic has concluded that certain liquid assets could be excluded from the deposit insurance assessment base of custody banks this subject to change by the fdic has the effect of reducing the amount of dif insurance premiums due from custody banks state street bank qualifies as a custody bank for this purpose the custody bank assessment adjustment may not exceed total transaction account deposits state street corporation identified by the institution as being directly linked to a fiduciary or custody and safekeeping asset prompt corrective action the fdic improvement act of requires the appropriate federal banking regulator to take prompt corrective action with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards including minimum capital ratios while these regulations apply only to banks such as state street bank the federal reserve is authorized to take appropriate action against a parent bank holding company such as our parent company based on the undercapitalized status of any banking subsidiary in certain instances we would be required to guarantee the performance of a capital restoration plan if one of our banking subsidiaries were undercapitalized support of subsidiary banks under federal reserve regulations a bank holding company such as our parent company is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its banking subsidiaries this requirement was added to the federal deposit insurance act by the doddfrank act this means that we have a statutory obligation to commit resources to state street bank and any other banking subsidiary in circumstances in which we otherwise might not do so absent such a requirement in the event of bankruptcy any commitment by us to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a banking subsidiary will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and will be entitled to a priority payment insolvency of an insured us subsidiary depository institution if the fdic is appointed the conservator or receiver of an fdicinsured us subsidiary depository institution such as state street bank upon

institutions creditors enforce the terms of the depository institutions contracts pursuant to their terms or repudiate or disaffirm contracts or leases to which the depository institution is a party additionally the claims of holders of deposit liabilities and certain claims for administrative expenses against an idi would be afforded priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution including claims of debt holders of the institution and under current interpretation depositors in nonus branches and offices in the liquidation or other resolution of such an institution by any receiver as a result such persons would be treated differently from and could receive if anything substantially less than the depositors in us offices of the depository institution cybersecurity and data privacy the financial services industry faces increased global regulatory focus regarding cybersecurity and data privacy many aspects of our businesses are subject to cybersecurity and data privacy legal and regulatory requirements enacted by us federal and state governments and other nonus jurisdictions these requirements impose among other things mandatory cybersecurity and data privacy obligations including providing for individual rights enhanced governance and accountability requirements and significant fines and litigation risk for noncompliance in addition several jurisdictions have enacted or proposed localization requirements and restrictions on crossborder transfers of personal information that may restrict our ability to conduct business in those jurisdictions or create additional financial legal and regulatory burdens to do so for example in the eu we are subject to the gdpr which requires among other things a comprehensive privacy data protection and cybersecurity program to protect the personal and sensitive data of residents of the european economic area following the withdrawal of the uk from the eu we are also subject to the uk general data protection regulation a version of the gdpr as implemented into uk law the us agencies finalized a rule in november requiring banking organizations to notify their primary federal regulators as soon as possible and no later than hours after identifying a computersecurity incident that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the viability of their operations their ability to deliver banking products and services or the stability of the financial sector the final rule became effective april in march the cyber incident reporting for critical infrastructure act circia was signed into law and requires among other things the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency cisa to develop and implement regulations for covered entities to report certain covered cyber incidents within hours from the time the company reasonably believes the incident occurred in addition the sec adopted new rules on july that require registrants to publicly disclose on a form 8k material cybersecurity incidents within four business days of determining that such an incident is material most recently the eu adopted dora in november which requires among other things financial institutions to follow certain rules regarding protection detection containment recovery and repair capabilities with respect to information and communication technologyrelated incidents financial institutions will have until january to comply with dora before enforcement begins in addition numerous jurisdictions have passed laws state street corporation rules and regulations regarding cybersecurity and data privacy risk management and many are considering new or updated requirements that could impact our businesses particularly as the application interpretation and enforcement of these laws rules and regulations are often uncertain and evolving further discussion of cybersecurity and data privacy risk management is provided in information technology risk management included in our managements discussion and analysis in this form 10k economic conditions and government policies economic policies of the us government and its agencies influence our operating environment monetary policy conducted by the federal reserve directly affects the level of interest rates which may affect overall credit conditions of the economy monetary policy is applied by the federal reserve through open market operations in us government securities changes in reserve requirements for depository institutions and changes in the discount rate and availability of borrowing from the federal reserve government regulation of banks and bank holding companies is intended primarily for the protection of depositors of the banks rather than for the shareholders of the institutions and therefore may in some cases be adverse to the interests of those shareholders we are similarly affected by the economic policies of nonus government agencies such as the ecb
