low with less than million of deposits denominated in russian roubles and with less than of our auca and less than of our aum consisting of russian securities as of march as of march we had no direct credit exposures to russiandomiciled entities including the russian central bank other than our subcustodian in russia which is an affiliate of a large multinational bank approximately of our employees globally continued to work remotely as of march compared to approximately as of december primarily due to the transition to hybrid working in many locations worldwide revenue total fee revenue and total revenue both increased in the first quarter of compared to the same period in primarily driven by increases across management fees foreign exchange trading services software and processing fees and other fee revenue servicing fee revenue was flat in the first quarter of compared to the same period in as higher client activity and flows average equity market levels and net new business were offset by normal pricing headwinds and the impact of currency translation currency translation negatively impacted servicing fees by in the first quarter of compared to the same period in management fee revenue increased in the first quarter of compared to the same period in primarily due to higher average equity market levels and net inflows from etfs foreign exchange trading

of march compared to march primarily due to higher equity market levels client flows and net new business growth in the first quarter of newly announced asset servicing mandates totaled approximately billion servicing assets remaining to be installed in future period totaled approximately trillion as of march aum of trillion increased as of march compared to march primarily due to higher market

totaling million in the same period in in july our board authorized a common share repurchase plan of up to billion of our common stock through the end of however in connection with our proposed acquisition of the bbh investor services business we did not repurchase any common stock during the third and fourth quarters of as well as the first quarter of we no longer expect to resume our share repurchase program in the second and third quarter of due primarily to net unrealized losses on afs securities reported in other comprehensive income for the first quarter of related to higher interest rates described below our standardized cet1 capital ratio decreased to as of march compared to as of december primarily reflecting lower aoci related to afs securities driven by the significant increase in rates across the yield curve the implementation of the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk saccr as well as the temporary deployment of rwa capital for revenue generating activities in our markets businesses our tier leverage ratio decreased to as of march compared to as of december primarily driven by lower aoci actions are underway that are intended to mitigate additional aoci risk in the current environment including but not limited to transfers of securities from afs to htm and shortening the portfolio duration through hedging activities and portfolio runoff there can be no assurance that such measures will be sufficient if the pace of rate increases continues at a historical level we expect both our cet1 and tier leverage capital ratios to be at or near the lower end of our target ranges of and respectively during the quarter within which the proposed acquisition of the bbh investor services business closes debt issuances and

fee revenue table total revenue provides the breakout of fee revenue for the first quarter of and servicing and management fees collectively made up approximately and of the total fee revenue in the first quarter of and respectively servicing fee revenue servicing fee revenue comprises revenue from both back office and middle office services generally our servicing fee revenues are affected by several factors including changes in market valuations client activity and asset flows net new business and the manner in which we price our services we provide a range of services to our clients including core custody services accounting reporting and administration which we refer to collectively as back office services and middle office services the nature and mix of services provided affects our servicing fees the basis for fees will differ across regions and clients changes in market valuations our servicing fee revenue is impacted by both our levels and the geographic and product mix of our auca increases or decreases in market valuations have a corresponding impact on the level of our auca and servicing fee revenues though the degree of impact will vary depending on asset types and classes and geography of assets held within our clients portfolios for certain asset classes where the valuation process is more complex including alternative investments or where our valuation is dependent on third party information auca is reported on a lag typically onemonth for those asset classes the impact of market levels on our reported auca does not reflect current periodend market levels over the five years ended december we estimate that worldwide market valuations impacted our servicing fee revenues by approximately on average with a range of to annually and

from the performance of the indices presented in addition our asset classifications may differ from those industry classifications presented nm state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations assuming that all other factors remain constant including client activity asset flows and pricing we estimate using relevant information as of march that a increase or decrease in worldwide equity valuations on a weighted average basis over the relevant periods for which our servicing fees are calculated would result in a corresponding change in our total servicing fee revenues on average and over multiple quarters of approximately we estimate similarly assuming all other factors remain constant and using relevant information as of march that changes in worldwide fixed income markets which on a weighted average basis and over time are typically less volatile than worldwide equity markets have a significantly smaller impact on

factors including transaction volumes asset levels and asset classes in which funds are invested as well as industry trends associated with these clientrelated activities our clients may change the asset classes in which their assets are invested based on their market outlook risk acceptance tolerance or other considerations over the five years ended december we estimate that client activity and asset flows together impacted our servicing fee revenues by approximately on average with a range of to annually and approximately and in and respectively see table industry asset flows for selected asset flow information while the asset flows presented are indicative of general market trends the asset types and classes relevant to individual client portfolios can and do differ and our flows may

africa are composed of the european market flows mainly in equities allocation and fixedincome asset classes the first quarter of data for europe is on a rolling three month basis for december through february sourced by morningstar net new business over the five years ended december net new business which includes business both won and lost has affected our servicing fee revenues by approximately on average with a range of to annually and approximately and in and respectively gross investment servicing mandates were billion in the first quarter of and trillion per year on average over the past five years over the five years ended december gross annual investment servicing mandates ranged from billion to trillion servicing fee revenue associated with new servicing mandates may vary based on the breadth of services provided the time required to install the assets and the types of assets installed revenues associated with new mandates are not reflected in our servicing fee revenue until the assets have been installed our installation timeline in general can range from to months with the average installation timeline being approximately to months over the past years our more complex installations including new state street alpha mandates will generally be on the longer end of that range with respect to the current asset mandates of approximately trillion that are yet to be installed as of march we expect the conversion will occur over the coming months pricing the industry in which we operate has historically faced pricing pressure and our servicing fee revenues are also affected by such pressures today consequently no assumption should be drawn as to future revenue run rate from announced servicing wins as the amount of revenue associated with auca can vary materially on average over the five years ended december we estimate that pricing pressure with respect to existing clients has impacted our servicing fees by approximately annually with the impact ranging from to in any given year and approximately in both and pricing concessions can be a part of a contract renegotiation with a client including terms that may benefit us such as extending the term of our relationship with the client expanding the scope of services that we provide or reducing our dependency on manual processes through the standardization of the services we provide the timing of the impact of additional revenue generated by anticipated additional services and the amount of revenue generated may differ from expectations due to the impact of pricing concessions on existing services due to the necessary time required to onboard those new services the nature of those services and client investment practices and other factors these same market pressures also impact the fees we negotiate when we win business from new clients state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in order to offset the typical client attrition and normal pricing headwinds we estimate that we need at least trillion of new auca per year although notwithstanding increases in auca servicing fees remain subject to several factors including changes in market valuations client activity and asset flows the manner in which we price our services the nature of the assets being serviced and the type of services and the other factors described in this form 10q historically and based on an indicative sample of revenue we estimate that approximately on average of our servicing fee revenues have been variable due to changes in asset valuations including changes in daily average valuations of auca another on average of our servicing fees are impacted by the volume of activity in the funds we serve and the remaining approximately of our servicing fees tend not to be variable in nature nor impacted by market fluctuations or values based on the impact of the above client activity and asset flows net new business and pricing noted drivers of our servicing fee revenue will vary depending on the mix of products and services we provide to our clients the full impact of changes in market valuations and the volume of activity in the funds may not be fully reflected in our servicing fee revenues in the periods in which the changes occur particularly in periods of higher volatility servicing fees as presented in table total revenue were flat in the first quarter of compared to the same period in as higher client activity and flows average equity market levels and net new business were offset by normal pricing headwinds and the impact of currency translation currency translation negatively impacted servicing fees by in the first quarter of compared to the same period in servicing fees

total consistent with past practice auca values for certain asset classes are based on a lag typically onemonth geographic mix is generally based on the domicile of the entity servicing the funds and is not necessarily representative of the underlying asset mix asset servicing mandates newly announced in the first quarter of totaled approximately billion servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods totaled approximately trillion as of march which will be reflected in auca in future periods after installation and will generate servicing fee revenue in subsequent periods the full revenue impact of such mandates will be realized as the assets are installed and additional services are added over that period new asset servicing mandates may be subject to completion of definitive agreements approval of applicable boards and shareholders and customary regulatory approvals new asset servicing mandates and servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods exclude certain new business which has been contracted but for which the client has not yet provided permission to publicly disclose and the expected installation date extends beyond one quarter these excluded assets which from time to time may be significant will be included in new asset servicing mandates and reflected in servicing assets remaining to be installed in the period in which the client provides its permission servicing mandates and servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods are presented on a gross basis and therefore also do not include the impact of clients who have notified us during the period of their intent to terminate or reduce their relationship with us which may from time to time be significant state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations with respect to these new servicing mandates once installed we may provide various services including back office services such as custody and safekeeping transaction processing and trade settlement fund administration reporting and record keeping security servicing fund accounting middle office services such as investment

liquidity solutions currency and collateral management securities finance and front office services such as portfolio management solutions risk analytics scenario analysis performance and attribution trade order and execution management pretrade compliance and esg investment tools revenues associated with new servicing mandates may vary based on the breadth of services provided and the timing of installation and the types of assets as a result of a decision to diversify providers one of our large asset servicing clients has advised us it expects to move a significant portion of its etf assets currently with state street to one or more other providers pending necessary approvals we expect to continue as a significant service provider for this client after this transition and for the client to continue to be meaningful to our business the transition is expected to begin in but will principally occur in and for the year ended december the fee revenue associated with the transitioning assets represented approximately of our total fee revenue the actual total revenue and income impact of this transition will reflect a range of factors including potential growth in our continuing business with the client and expense reductions associated with the transition management fee revenue management fees generally are affected by our level of aum which we report based on monthend valuations management fees for certain components of managed assets such as etfs mutual funds and undertakings for collective investments in transferable securities are affected by daily average valuations of aum management fee revenue is more sensitive to market valuations than servicing fee revenue as a higher proportion of the underlying services provided and the associated management fees earned are dependent on equity and fixedincome security valuations additional factors such as the relative mix of assets managed may have a significant effect on our management fee revenue while certain management fees are directly determined by the values of aum and the investment strategies employed management fees may reflect other factors including performance fee arrangements as well as our relationship pricing for clients in addition in a prolonged lowinterest rate environment we have waived and may in the future waive certain fees for our clients for money market products the impact of state street global advisors gross money market fund fee waivers on total management fee revenue was approximately million in the first quarter of down from levels in prior quarters following the federal reserve rate hike in march we do not expect money market fund fee waivers to materially impact subsequent quarters in assetbased management fees for passively managed products to which our aum is currently primarily weighted are generally charged at a lower fee on aum than for actively managed products actively managed products may also include performance fee arrangements which are recorded when the fee is earned based on predetermined benchmarks associated with the applicable accounts performance in light of the above we estimate using relevant information as of march and assuming that all other factors remain constant including the impact of business won and lost and client flows that a increase or decrease in worldwide equity valuations on a weighted average basis over the relevant periods for which our management fees are calculated would result in a corresponding change in our total management fee revenues on average and over multiple quarters of approximately and changes in worldwide fixed income markets which on a weighted average basis and over time are typically less volatile than worldwide equity markets will have a significantly smaller impact on our management fee revenues on average and over time daily averages monthend averages and yearend indices demonstrate worldwide changes in equity and debt markets that affect our management fee revenue yearend indices affect the values of aum as of those dates see table daily averages monthend averages and quarterend equity indices for selected indices while the specific indices

trading desk directly these principal marketmaking activities include transactions for funds serviced by third party custodians or prime brokers as well as those funds under custody with us indirect fx trading represents fx transactions with clients for which we are the funds custodian or their investment managers routed to our fx desk through our assetservicing operation we execute indirect fx trades as a principal at rates disclosed to our clients our fx trading revenue is influenced by multiple factors including the volume and type of client fx transactions and related spreads currency volatility reflecting market conditions and our management of exchange rate interest rate and other market risks associated with our fx activities the relative impact of these factors on our total fx trading revenues often differs from period to period for example assuming all other factors remain constant increases or decreases in volumes or bidoffer spreads across product mix tend to result in increases or decreases as the case may be in clientrelated fx revenue our clients that utilize indirect fx trading can in addition to executing their fx transactions through dealers not affiliated with us transition from indirect fx trading to either direct sales and trading execution including our street fx service or to one of our electronic trading platforms street fx in which we continue to

securities finance revenue earned from our agency lending activities which is composed of our split of both the spreads related to cash collateral and the fees related to noncash collateral is principally a function of the volume of securities on loan the interest rate spreads and fees earned on the underlying collateral and our share of the fee split as principal our enhanced custody business borrows securities from the lending client or other market participants and then lends such securities to the subsequent borrower either our client or a brokerdealer we act as principal when the lending client is unable to or elects not to transact directly with the market and execute the transaction and furnish the securities in our role as principal we provide support to the transaction through our credit rating while we source a significant proportion of the securities furnished by us in our role as principal from third parties we have the ability to source securities through assets under custody from clients who have designated us as an eligible borrower securities finance revenue as presented in table total revenue decreased in the first quarter of compared to the same period in primarily driven by lower average agency assets on loan partially offset by new business wins in enhanced custody market influences may continue to affect client demand for securities finance and as a result our revenue from and the profitability of our securities lending activities in future periods in addition the constantly evolving regulatory environment including revised or proposed

total revenue increased in the first quarter of compared to the same period in front office software and data revenue which includes primarily revenue from crd alpha data platform and alpha data services increased in the first quarter of compared to the same period in primarily due to higher crd revenue from onpremises renewals revenue related to the front office solutions provided by crd is primarily driven by the sale of term software licenses and saas including professional services such as consulting and implementation services software support and maintenance approximately of revenue associated with a sale of software to be installed onpremises is recognized at a point in time when the customer benefits from obtaining access to and use of the software license with the percentage varying based on the length of the contract and other contractual terms the remainder of revenue for onpremise installations is recognized over the length of the contract as maintenance and other

contract revenue for a saas related arrangement where the state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations customer does not take possession of the software is recognized over the term of the contract as services are provided upon renewal of a saas arrangement revenue continues to be recognized as services are provided under the

company as defined in the us lcr final rule as it prohibits the upstreaming of liquidity under stress the average hqla for the parent company under the lcr final rule definition was billion and billion postprescribed haircuts for the quarters ended march and december respectively for the quarter ended march lcr for state street bank and trust was approximately state street bank and trusts lcr is higher than the parent companys lcr primarily due to application of the transferability restriction in the lcr final rule to the calculation of the parent companys lcr this restriction limits the hqla used in the calculation of the parent companys lcr to the amount of net cash outflows of its principal banking subsidiary state street bank and trust this transferability restriction does not apply in the calculation of state street bank and trusts lcr and therefore state street bank and trusts lcr reflects the benefit of all of its hqla holdings we maintained average cash balances in excess of regulatory requirements governing deposits with the federal reserve of approximately billion at the federal reserve the ecb and other nonus central banks for the quarter ended march and billion for the quarter ended december the lower levels of average cash balances with central banks reflect lower levels of client deposits liquid securities carried in our asset liquidity include securities pledged without corresponding advances from the federal reserve bank of boston frbb the fhlb and other nonus central banks state street bank is a member of the fhlb this membership allows for advances of liquidity in varying terms against highquality collateral which helps facilitate assetandliability management as of both march and december we had no outstanding borrowings from the fhlb access to primary intraday and contingent liquidity provided by these utilities is an important source of contingent liquidity with utilization subject to underlying conditions as of both march and december we had no outstanding primary credit borrowings from the frbb discount window or any other central bank facility in addition to the securities included in our asset liquidity we have significant amounts of other unencumbered investment securities these securities are available sources of liquidity although not as rapidly deployed as those included in our asset liquidity the average fair value of total unencumbered securities was billion for the quarter ended march compared to billion for the quarter ended december state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations uses of liquidity significant uses of our liquidity could result from the following withdrawals of client deposits drawdowns by our custody clients of lines of credit advances to clients to settle securities transactions increases in our investment and loan portfolios or other permitted purposes such circumstances would generally arise under stress conditions including deterioration in credit ratings a recurring use of our liquidity involves our deployment of hqla from our investment portfolio to post collateral to financial institutions serving as sources of securities under our enhanced custody program we had unfunded commitments to extend credit with gross contractual amounts totaling billion and billion and standby letters of credit totaling billion and billion as of march and december respectively these amounts do not reflect the value of any collateral as of march approximately of our unfunded commitments to extend credit and of our standby letters of credit expire within one year since many of our commitments are expected to expire or renew without being drawn upon the gross contractual amounts do not necessarily represent our future cash requirements resolution planning under section 165d of the doddfrank act we are required to submit a resolution plan on a biennial basis jointly to the federal reserve and the fdic the agencies the purpose of our resolution plan is to describe our preferred resolution strategy and to demonstrate that we have the resources and capabilities to execute on that strategy in the event of major financial distress through resolution planning we seek to maintain our role as a key infrastructure provider within the financial system while minimizing risk to the financial system the final rule published in the federal register on november requires a full resolution plan and a targeted resolution plan on an alternating basis in the relevant submission years we submitted our updated targeted 165d resolution plan by july the targeted resolution plan included the core elements of resolution planning and some specific firm level information about the impact of the covid19 pandemic on resolution planning in addition actions taken to remediate the shortcoming related to the implementation of governance mechanisms were included in the plan our next full resolution plan is due july in the event of material financial distress our preferred resolution strategy is the spoe strategy the spoe strategy provides that prior to the bankruptcy of the parent company and pursuant to a support agreement among the parent company ssif a direct subsidiary of the parent company our beneficiary entities as defined below and certain of our other entities ssif is obligated up to its available resources to recapitalize andor provide liquidity to state street bank and the other entities benefiting from such capital andor liquidity support collectively with state street bank beneficiary entities in amounts designed to prevent the beneficiary entities from themselves entering into resolution proceedings following the recapitalization of or provision of liquidity to the beneficiary entities the parent company would enter into a bankruptcy proceeding under the us bankruptcy code the beneficiary entities and our other subsidiaries would be transferred to a newly organized holding company held by a reorganization trust for the benefit of the parent companys claimants under the support agreement the parent company has prefunded ssif by contributing certain of its assets primarily its liquid assets cash deposits investments in intercompany debt investments in marketable securities and other cash and noncash equivalent investments to ssif at the time it entered into the support agreement and will continue to contribute such assets to the extent available on an ongoing basis in consideration for these contributions ssif has agreed in the support agreement to provide capital and liquidity support to the parent company and all of the beneficiary entities in accordance with the parent companys capital and liquidity policies under the support agreement the parent company is only permitted to retain cash needed to meet its upcoming obligations and to fund expected expenses during a potential bankruptcy proceeding ssif has provided the parent company with a committed credit line and issued and may issue one or more promissory notes to the parent company the parent company funding notes that together are intended to allow the parent company to continue to meet its obligations throughout the period prior to the occurrence of a recapitalization event which is defined under the support agreement as the earlier occurrence of one or more capital and liquidity thresholds being breached or the authorization by the parent companys board of directors for the parent company to commence bankruptcy proceedings the support agreement does not obligate ssif to maintain any specific level of resources and ssif may not have sufficient resources to implement the spoe strategy in the event a recapitalization event occurs the obligations outstanding under the parent company funding notes would automatically convert into or be exchanged for capital contributed to ssif the obligations of the parent company and ssif under the support agreement are secured through a security state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations agreement that grants a lien on the assets that the parent company and ssif would use to fulfill their obligations under the support agreement to the beneficiary entities ssif is a distinct legal entity separate from the parent company and the parent companys other affiliates in accordance with our policies we are required to monitor on an ongoing basis the capital and liquidity needs of state street bank and our other beneficiary entities to support this process we have established a trigger framework that identifies key actions that would need to be taken or decisions that would need to be made if certain events tied to our financial condition occur the trigger thresholds are set at levels intended to provide for the availability of sufficient capital and liquidity to enable an orderly resolution without extraordinary government support that results in us emerging from resolution as a stabilized institution with market confidence restored upon the occurrence of a recapitalization event ssif would not be authorized to provide any further liquidity to the parent company the parent company would be required to contribute to ssif any remaining assets it is required to contribute to ssif under the support agreement which specifically exclude amounts designated to fund expected expenses during a potential bankruptcy proceeding ssif would be required to provide capital and liquidity support to the beneficiary entities to support such entities continued operation to the extent of its available resources and consistent with the support agreement and the parent company would be expected to commence chapter proceedings under the us bankruptcy code no person or entity other than a party to the support agreement should rely on any of our affiliates being or remaining a beneficiary entity or receiving capital or liquidity support pursuant to the support agreement including in evaluating any of our entities from a creditors perspective or determining whether to enter into a contractual relationship with any of our entities state street bank is also required to submit periodically to the fdic a plan for resolution in the event of its failure referred to as an idi plan we submitted our last idi plan before july in november the fdic had announced that until the fdic completed revisions to its idi plan requirements no idi plans would be required to be filed on june the fdic issued a policy statement on resolution plans for idis that allows for content streamlining and adjusts the frequency of submissions to a threeyear cycle state street banks next idi plan submission deadline is december additionally we are required to submit a recovery plan to the federal reserve this plan includes detailed governance triggers and contingency actions that can be implemented in a timely manner in the event of extreme financial distress in those entities we also have recovery planning requirements in certain international jurisdictions where we operate funding deposits we provide products and services including custody accounting administration daily pricing fx services cash management financial asset management securities finance and investment advisory services as a provider of these products and services we generate client deposits which have generally provided a stable lowcost source of funds as a global custodian clients place deposits with our entities in various currencies as of both march and december approximately of our average total deposit balances were denominated in us dollars in eur in the british pound sterling gbp and in all other currencies shortterm funding our onbalance sheet liquid assets are also an integral component of our liquidity management strategy these assets provide liquidity through maturities of the assets but more importantly they provide us with the ability to raise funds by pledging the securities as collateral for borrowings or through outright sales in addition our access to the global capital markets gives us the ability to source incremental funding from wholesale investors as discussed earlier under asset liquidity state street banks membership in the fhlb allows for advances of liquidity with varying terms against highquality collateral shortterm secured funding also comes in the form of securities lent or sold under agreements to repurchase these transactions are shortterm in nature generally overnight and are collateralized by highquality investment securities these balances were billion and billion as of march and december respectively state street bank currently maintains a line of credit with a financial institution of cad billion or approximately billion as of march to support its canadian securities processing operations the line of credit has no stated termination date and is cancelable by either party with prior notice as of both march and december there was no balance outstanding on this line of credit state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations longterm funding we have the ability to issue debt and equity securities under our current universal shelf registration statement to meet current commitments and business needs the total amount remaining for issuance under the registration statement is billion as of march in addition state street bank also has current authorization from the board to issue up to billion in unsecured senior debt on february we issued million aggregate principal amount of fixedtofloating rate senior notes due million aggregate principal amount of fixedtofloating rate senior notes due and million aggregate principal amount of fixedtofloating rate senior notes due on march we redeemed million aggregate principal amount of fixedtofloating rate senior notes due on april we notified the holders of our million aggregate principal amount of fixedtofloating rate senior notes due that we will redeem all of the notes on may agency credit ratings our ability to maintain consistent access to liquidity is fostered by the maintenance of high investment grade ratings as measured by the major independent credit rating agencies factors essential to maintaining high credit ratings include diverse and stable core earnings relative market position strong risk management strong capital ratios diverse liquidity sources including the global capital markets and client deposits strong liquidity monitoring procedures and preparedness for current or future regulatory developments high ratings limit borrowing costs and enhance our liquidity by providing assurance for unsecured funding and depositors increasing the potential market for our debt and improving our ability to offer products serving markets and engaging in transactions in which clients value high credit ratings a downgrade or reduction of our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity by restricting our ability to access the capital markets which could increase the related cost of funds in turn this could cause the sudden and largescale withdrawal of unsecured deposits by our clients which could lead to drawdowns of unfunded commitments to extend credit or trigger requirements under securities purchase commitments or require additional collateral or force terminations of certain trading derivative contracts a majority of our derivative contracts have been entered into under bilateral agreements with counterparties who may require us to post collateral or terminate the transactions based on changes in our credit ratings we assess the impact of these arrangements by determining the collateral that would be required assuming a downgrade by all rating agencies the additional collateral or termination payments related to our net derivative liabilities under these arrangements that could have been called by counterparties in the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings below levels specified in the agreements is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10q other funding sources such as secured financing transactions and other margin requirements for which there are no explicit triggers could

trillion of which trillion was composed of foreign exchange forward swap and spot contracts we seek to match positions closely with the objective of mitigating related currency and interest rate risk all foreign exchange contracts are valued daily at current market rates valueatrisk and stressed var we use a variety of risk measurement tools and methodologies including var which is an estimate of potential loss for a given period within a stated statistical confidence interval we use a risk measurement methodology to measure tradingrelated var daily we have adopted standards for measuring tradingrelated var and we maintain regulatory capital for market risk associated with our trading activities in conformity with currently applicable bank regulatory market risk requirements our regulatory varbased measure is calculated based on historical volatilities of market risk factors during a twoyear observation period calibrated to a onetail confidence interval and a tenbusinessday holding period we calculate a stressed varbased measure using the same model we use to calculate var but with model inputs calibrated to historical data from a range of continuous twelvemonth periods that reflect significant financial stress the stressed var model is designed to identify the secondworst outcome occurring in the worst continuous oneyear rolling period since july this stressed var meets the regulatory requirement as the rolling tenday period with an outcome that is worse than of other outcomes during that twelvemonth period of financial stress for each portfolio the stress period is determined algorithmically by seeking the oneyear time horizon that produces the largest tenbusinessday var from within the available historical data this historical data set includes the financial crisis of the highly volatile period surrounding the eurozone sovereign debt crisis and the standard poors downgrade of us treasury debt in august as the historical data set used to determine the stress period expands over time future market stress events will be incorporated for additional information about our var measurement tools and methodologies refer to pages to included

we could suffer in a hypothetical scenario of adverse economic and financial conditions we also monitor concentrations of risk such as concentration by branch risk component and currency pairs we conduct stress testing on a daily basis based on selected historical stress events that are relevant to our positions in order to estimate the potential impact to our current portfolio should similar market conditions recur and we also perform stress testing as part of the federal reserves ccar process stress testing is conducted analyzed and reported at the corporate trading desk division and

reported to the credit and market risk committee cmrc limit breaches are addressed by erm risk managers in conjunction with the business units escalated as appropriate and reviewed by the cmrc if material in addition we have established several action triggers that prompt review by management and the implementation of a remediation plan validation and backtesting we perform frequent backtesting to assess the accuracy of our varbased model in estimating loss at the stated confidence level this backtesting involves the comparison of estimated var model outputs to daily actual profitandloss pl outcomes observed from daily market movements we backtest our var model using clean pl which excludes nontrading revenue such as fees commissions and nii as well as estimated revenue from intraday trading our var definition of trading losses excludes items that are not specific to the price movement of the trading assets and liabilities themselves such as fees commissions changes to reserves and gains or losses from intraday activity we had one backtesting exception in the quarter ended march one backtesting exception in the quarter ended december and no backtesting exceptions

sustainable nii under varying economic conditions while protecting the economic value of the assets and liabilities carried on our consolidated statement of condition from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates while many market factors affect the level of nii and the economic value of our assets and liabilities one of the most significant factors is our exposure to movements in interest rates most of our nii is earned from the investment of client deposits generated by our businesses we invest these client deposits in assets that conform generally to the characteristics of our balance sheet liabilities including the currency composition of our significant nonus dollar denominated client deposits we quantify nii sensitivity using an earnings simulation model that includes our expectations for new business growth changes in balance sheet mix and investment portfolio positioning this measure compares our baseline view of nii over a twelvemonth horizon based on our internal forecast of interest rates to a wide range of rate shocks our baseline view of nii is updated on a regular basis table key interest rates for baseline forecasts presents the spot and 12month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts at march and march our march baseline forecast aligns to the markets expectations for a rapid increase in global central bank rates in response to

interim term points are interpolated as of march nii is expected to benefit from an increase in interest rates compared to march nii is less sensitive to parallel rate increases primarily due to improvement in our nii from recent rate increases in our baseline forecast and the benefit of additional us rate hikes beginning to diminish due to higher deposit betas our current simulations assume that deposit betas are higher than the last us rising rate cycle from due to our current deposit mix and the pacing of us rate hikes occurring over a shorter period of time with the change to our baseline interest rate forecast which assumes a sharp rise in central bank rates nii is now exposed to lower interest rate scenarios as our baseline outlook for nii improves over the next twelvemonth period lower rate scenarios relative to our baseline view highlight the nii at risk if the baseline rate outlook is not realized as previously disclosed during periods when us interest rates are near

related to the transition potential risks that could impact our remediation efforts include overall transition readiness across the industry third party vendor dependencies and resource constraints from the concentration of remediation activities at key points in the transition process our direct on balance sheet exposures to libor are limited and primarily include assets held in the investment portfolio certain loans made through global credit finance and issuances of longterm debt and preferred stock we have planned for and are prepared to transition our remaining on balance sheet exposures in a manner consistent with regulatory guidance and the availability of interim solutions for various legacy libor contracts we will not originate or issue new liborbased loans or longterm debt and any purchases of liborbased investment securities will be screened for adequate fallback language our remaining exposure outstanding at june is largely governed by existing fallback language

capital adequacy the standardized approach and the advanced approaches applicable to advanced approaches banking organizations like us the standardized approach prescribes standardized calculations for credit risk rwa including specified risk weights for certain on and offbalance sheet exposures the advanced approaches consist of the advanced internal ratingsbased approach used for the calculation of rwa related to credit risk and the advanced measurement approach used for the calculation of rwa related to operational risk as required by the doddfrank act enacted in and the scb rule enacted in we and state street bank as advanced approaches banking organizations are subject to a capital floor also referred to as the collins amendment in the assessment of our regulatory capital adequacy including the capital conservation buffer ccb and the scb for the advanced approaches and standardized approach respectively and a countercyclical capital buffer in addition we are subject to a gsib surcharge our riskbased capital ratios for regulatory assessment purposes are the lower of each ratio calculated under the advanced approaches and standardized approach the scb replaced under the standardized approach the capital conservation buffer with a buffer calculated as the difference between the institutions starting and lowest projected cet1 ratio under the ccar severely adverse scenario plus planned common stock dividend payments as a percentage of rwa from the fourth through seventh quarter of the ccar planning horizon the scb requirement can be no less than of rwa

compared to december mainly driven by an increase in credit risk rwa the increase in credit risk rwa was primarily driven by the implementation of saccr as expected as well as a temporary deployment of rwa capital for revenue generating activities in our markets businesses the regulatory capital ratios as of march presented in table regulatory capital structure and related regulatory capital ratios are calculated under the advanced approaches and standardized approach in conformity with the basel iii final rule the advanced approachesbased ratios reflect calculations and determinations with respect to our capital and related matters as of march based on our and external data quantitative formulae statistical models historical correlations and assumptions collectively referred to as advanced systems in effect and used by us for those purposes as of the time we first reported such ratios in a quarterly report on form 10q or an annual report on form 10k significant components of these advanced systems involve the exercise of judgment by us and our regulators and our advanced systems may not individually or collectively precisely represent or calculate the scenarios circumstances outputs or other results for which they are designed or intended our advanced systems are subject to update and periodic revalidation in response to changes in our business activities and our historical experiences forces and events experienced by the market broadly or by individual financial institutions changes in regulations and regulatory interpretations and other factors and are also subject to continuing regulatory review and approval for example a significant operational loss experienced by another financial institution even if we do not experience a related loss could result in a material change in the output of our advanced systems and a corresponding material change in our risk exposures our total rwa and our capital ratios compared to prior periods an operational loss that we experience could also result in a material change in our capital requirements for operational risk under the advanced approaches depending on the severity of the loss event its characterization among the seven baseldefined uom and the stability of the distributional approach for a particular uom and without direct correlation to the effects of the loss event or the timing of such effects on our results of operations due to the influence of changes in these advanced systems whether resulting from changes in data inputs regulation or regulatory supervision or interpretation specific to us or market activities or experiences or other updates or factors we expect that our advanced systems and our capital ratios calculated in conformity with the basel iii final rule will change and may be volatile over time and that those latter changes or volatility could be material as calculated and measured from period to period the full effects of the basel iii final rule on us and state street bank are therefore subject to further evaluation and also to further regulatory guidance action or rulemaking na state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tier and supplementary leverage ratios we are subject to a minimum tier leverage ratio and a supplementary leverage ratio the tier leverage ratio is based on tier capital and adjusted quarterly average onbalance sheet assets the tier leverage ratio differs from the slr primarily in that the denominator of the tier leverage ratio is a quarterly average of onbalance sheet assets while the slr additionally includes offbalance sheet exposures we must maintain a minimum tier leverage ratio of we are also subject to a minimum slr of and as a us gsib we must maintain a slr buffer in order to avoid any limitations on distributions to shareholders and discretionary bonus payments to certain executives if we do not maintain this buffer

modifications to our tlac and eligible ltd requirements applicable to gsibs at this point in time it is unclear whether this proposal will be implemented as proposed in november the federal reserve and other us federal banking agencies issued a final rule that among other things implemented the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk saccr a methodology for calculating the exposure amount for derivative contracts under the final rule which became effective on january we have the option to use the saccr or the internal model methodology imm to measure the exposure amount of our cleared and uncleared derivative transactions under our advanced approaches calculation we have elected to use the saccr for purposes of our advanced approaches capital calculations we are required to determine the amount of these exposures using the saccr under our standardized approach capital calculation additionally we have to apply a revised formula to determine the rwa amount of our central counterparty default fund contributions the adoption of the saccr in place of thenapplicable current exposure method cem resulted in an increase in our standardized rwa as of march as part of a plan to partially offset this impact various optimization actions are being implemented across business lines with an expected completion in the first half of on march the us federal banking agencies issued the scb final rule that replaces under the standardized approach the capital conservation buffer with a scb calculated as the difference between an institutions starting and lowest projected cet1 ratio under the ccar severely adverse scenario plus planned common stock dividend payments as a percentage of rwa from the fourth through seventh quarter of the ccar planning horizon based on our results from the supervisory stress test our scb for the period of october through september is set at the minimum of of rwa the federal reserve and other us federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule effective in march and later finalized on a permanent basis on august which revised the definition of eligible retained income for all us banking organizations the revised definition of eligible retained income makes any automatic limitations on capital distributions where a banking organizations regulatory ratios were to decline below the respective minimum requirements take effect on a more gradual basis on march the bcbs announced the deferral of the implementation of the revisions to the basel iii framework to january as of now the us federal banking agencies have not formally proposed the implementation of the bcbs revisions effective april the federal reserve and other us federal banking agencies adopted a final rule as part of egrrcpa that establishes a deduction for qualifying central bank deposits from a custodial banking organizations total leverage exposure equal to the lesser of i the total amount of funds the custodial banking organization and its consolidated subsidiaries have on deposit at qualifying central banks and ii the total amount of client funds on deposit at the custodial banking organization that are linked to fiduciary or custodial and safekeeping accounts for the quarter ended march we deducted billion of average balances held on deposit at central banks from the denominator used in the calculation of our slr based on this custodial banking deduction on october the federal reserve and other us federal banking agencies issued a final rule that requires us and state street bank to make certain deductions from regulatory capital for investments in certain unsecured debt instruments including eligible ltd under the tlac rule issued by the parent company and other us and foreign gsibs the final rule became effective on april our scb requirement was for the period from october through september on june we were notified by the federal reserve of the results from the supervisory stress test our scb calculated under the supervisory stress test was well below the minimum resulting in an scb at that floor which was effective starting october and will run through september the federal reserve also
