were approximately and of total servicing fees in the first quarter of and respectively servicing fee revenue comprises revenue from both back office and middle office services generally our servicing fee revenues are affected by several factors including changes in market valuations client activity and asset flows net new business and the manner in which we price our services we provide a range of services to our clients including core custody services accounting reporting and administration which we refer to collectively as back office services and middle office services the nature and mix of services provided and the asset classes for which the services are performed affect our servicing fees the basis for fees will differ across regions and clients changes in market valuations our servicing fee revenue is impacted by both our levels and the geographic and product mix of our auca increases or decreases in market valuations have a corresponding impact on the level of our auca and servicing fee revenues though the degree of impact will vary depending on asset types and classes and geography of assets held within our clients portfolios for certain asset classes where the valuation process is more complex including alternative investments or where our valuation is dependent on third party information auca is reported on a time lag typically onemonth for those asset classes the impact of market levels on our reported auca does not reflect current periodend market levels nm state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and

can therefore differ from the performance of the indices presented in addition our asset classifications may differ from those industry classifications presented assuming that all other factors remain constant including client activity asset flows and pricing we estimate using relevant information as of march that a increase or decrease in worldwide equity valuations on a weighted average basis over the relevant periods for which our servicing fees are calculated would result in a corresponding change in our total servicing fee revenues on average and over multiple quarters of approximately we estimate similarly assuming all other factors remain constant and using relevant information as of march that changes in worldwide fixed income markets which on a weighted average basis and over time are typically less volatile than worldwide equity markets have a smaller corresponding impact on our servicing fee revenues on average and over time in periods of higher fixed income market volatility such as we have been experiencing since the second quarter of the impact of fixed income markets on our servicing fee revenues may increase table daily averages monthend averages and

trends associated with these clientrelated activities our clients may change the asset classes in which their assets are invested based on their market outlook risk acceptance tolerance or other considerations over the five years ended december we estimate that client activity and asset flows together impacted our servicing fees revenue by approximately on average with a range of to annually

fixedincome asset classes the longterm fund flows reported by morningstar direct in emea are composed of the european market flows mainly in equities allocation and fixedincome asset classes the first quarter of data for europe is on a rolling three month basis for december through february sourced by morningstar net new business over the five years ended december net new business which includes business both won and lost has affected our servicing fee revenues by approximately on average with a range of to annually and approximately in both and gross investment servicing mandates were billion in the first quarter of and trillion per year on average over the past five years over the five years ended december gross annual investment servicing mandates ranged from approximately trillion to trillion servicing fee revenue associated with new servicing mandates may vary based on the breadth of services provided the time required to install the assets and the types of assets installed revenues associated with new mandates are not reflected in our servicing fee revenue until the assets have been installed our installation timeline in general can range from to months with the average installation timeline being approximately to months over the past years we expect that our more complex installations including new state street alpha mandates will generally be on the longer end of that range with respect to the current asset mandates of approximately trillion that are yet to be installed as of march we expect the conversion will occur over the coming months pricing the industry in which we operate has historically faced pricing pressure and our servicing fee revenues are also affected by such pressures today consequently no assumption should be drawn as to future revenue run rate from announced servicing wins as the amount of revenue associated with auca once installed can vary materially on average over the five years ended december we estimate that pricing pressure with respect to existing clients has impacted our servicing fees by approximately annually with the impact ranging from to in any given year and approximately in both and pricing concessions can be a part of a contract renegotiation with a client including terms that may benefit us such as extending the term of our relationship with the client expanding the scope of services that we provide or reducing our dependency on manual processes through the standardization of the services we provide the timing of the impact of additional revenue generated by anticipated additional services and the amount of revenue generated may differ from expectations due to the impact of pricing concessions on existing services due to the necessary time required to onboard those new services the nature of those services and client investment practices and other factors these same market pressures also impact the fees we negotiate when we win business from new clients in order to offset the typical client attrition and normal pricing headwinds we estimate that we need at least trillion of new auca per year although notwithstanding increases in auca servicing fees remain subject to state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations several factors including changes in market valuations client activity and asset flows the manner in which we price our services the nature of the assets being serviced and the type of services and the other factors described in this form 10q historically and based on an indicative sample of revenue we estimate that approximately on average of our servicing fee revenues have been variable due to changes in asset valuations including changes in daily average valuations of auca another on average of our servicing fees are impacted by the volume of activity in the funds we serve and the remaining approximately of our servicing fees tend not to be variable in nature nor impacted by market fluctuations or values based on the impact of the above client activity and asset flows net new business and pricing noted drivers of our servicing fee revenue will vary depending on the mix of products and services we provide to our clients the full impact of changes in market valuations and the volume of activity in the funds may not be fully reflected in our servicing fee revenues in the periods in which the changes occur particularly in periods of higher volatility table assets under custody andor administration by product in billions march december march collective funds including

mix is generally based on the domicile of the entity servicing the funds and is not necessarily representative of the underlying asset mix asset servicing mandates newly announced in the first quarter of totaled approximately billion servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods totaled approximately trillion as of march which will be reflected in auca in future periods after installation and will generate servicing fee revenue in subsequent periods the full revenue impact of such mandates will be realized as the assets are installed and additional services are added over that period new asset servicing mandates may be subject to completion of definitive agreements approval of applicable boards and shareholders and customary regulatory approvals new asset servicing mandates and servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods exclude certain new business which has been contracted but for which the client has not yet provided permission to publicly disclose and the expected installation date extends beyond one quarter these excluded assets which from time to time may be significant will be included in new asset servicing mandates and reflected in servicing assets remaining to be installed in the period in which the client provides its permission servicing mandates and servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods are presented on a gross basis and therefore also do not include the impact of clients who have notified us during the period of their intent to terminate or reduce their relationship with us which may from time to time be significant with respect to these new servicing mandates once installed we may provide various services including back office services such as custody and safekeeping transaction

pretrade state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations compliance and esg investment tools revenues associated with new servicing mandates may vary based on the breadth of services provided the timing of installation and the types of assets as previously disclosed in early due to a decision to diversify providers one of our large asset servicing clients has advised us it expects to move a significant portion of its etf assets currently with state street to one or more other providers pending necessary approvals we expect to continue as a significant service provider for this client after this transition and for the client to continue to be meaningful to our business the transition began in but will principally occur in and and will impact our fee revenue and income growth trends through for the year ended december the fee revenue associated with the assets yet to transition represented approximately of our total fee revenue the actual total revenue and income impact of this transition will reflect a range of factors including potential growth in our continuing business with the client and expense reductions associated with the transition management fee revenue management fees decreased in the first quarter of compared to the same period of primarily due to lower average equity and fixed income market levels and a previously reported clientspecific pricing adjustment management fees generated outside the us were approximately and of total management fees in the first quarter of and respectively management fees generally are affected by our level of aum which we report based on monthend valuations management fees for certain components of managed assets such as etfs mutual funds and undertakings for collective investments in transferable securities are affected by daily average valuations of aum management fee revenue is more sensitive to market valuations than servicing fee revenue as a higher proportion of the underlying services provided and the associated management fees earned are dependent on equity and fixedincome security valuations additional factors such as the relative mix of assets managed may have a significant effect on our management fee revenue while certain management fees are directly determined by the values of aum and the investment strategies employed management fees may reflect other factors including performance fee arrangements as well as our relationship pricing for clients assetbased management fees for passively managed products to which our aum is currently primarily weighted are generally charged at a lower fee on aum than for actively managed products actively managed products may also include performance fee arrangements which are recorded when the fee is earned based on predetermined benchmarks associated with the applicable accounts performance in light of the above we estimate using relevant information as of march and assuming that all other factors remain constant including the impact of business won and lost and client flows that a increase or decrease in worldwide equity valuations on a weighted average basis over the relevant periods for which our management fees are calculated would result in a corresponding change in our total management fee revenues on average and over multiple quarters of approximately and changes in worldwide fixed income markets which on a weighted average basis and over time are typically less volatile than worldwide equity markets will have a significantly smaller

incurred by the organization and provide liquidity support in the event of the default of another member to the extent that the defaulting members clearing fund obligation and the prescribed loss allocation to ficc is depleted it is difficult to estimate our maximum possible exposure under the membership agreement since this would require an assessment of future claims that may be made against

securities finance fee revenue as well as net interest income average total interestbearing deposits decreased to billion in the first quarter of from billion in the same period of the decrease is

potential increases in cash needs or decreases in available sources of cash as well as the potential impairment of our ability to access the global capital markets we manage our liquidity on a global consolidated basis as well as on a standalone basis at our parent company and at certain branches and subsidiaries of state street bank state street bank generally has access to markets and funding sources limited to banks such as the federal funds market the federal reserves discount window and the bank term funding program the parent company is managed to a more conservative liquidity profile reflecting narrower market access additionally the parent company typically holds or has direct access to primarily through ssif a direct subsidiary of the parent company and the support agreement as

the lcr rule approved by us banking regulators the lcr is intended to promote the shortterm resilience of internationally active banking organizations like us to improve the banking industrys ability to absorb shocks arising from market stress over a calendar day period and improve the measurement and management of liquidity risk the lcr measures an institutions hqla against its net cash outflows hqla primarily consists of unencumbered cash and certain high quality liquid securities that qualify for inclusion under the lcr rule net cash outflows are measured as prescribed under the lcr rule which provides a significant benefit for deposits classified as operational we report lcr to the federal reserve daily for the quarters ended march and december daily average lcr for the parent company was and respectively the impact of higher deposits on the parent companys lcr is limited by a cap known as the transferability restriction on the hqla from state street bank and trust that can

approximately we maintained average cash balances in excess of regulatory requirements governing deposits with the federal reserve the ecb and other nonus central banks of approximately billion for

carried in our asset liquidity include securities pledged without corresponding advances from the federal reserve bank of boston frbb the fhlb and other nonus central banks state street bank is a

these additional assets are available sources of liquidity and not included in our lcr asset liquidity the average fair value of total unencumbered securities was billion for the quarter ended march

of lines of credit advances to clients to settle securities transactions increases in our investment and loan portfolios or other permitted purposes such circumstances would generally arise under

company held by a reorganization trust for the benefit of the parent companys claimants under the support agreement the parent company has prefunded ssif by contributing certain of its assets primarily its liquid assets cash deposits investments in intercompany debt investments in marketable securities and other cash and noncash equivalent investments to ssif at the time it entered into the support agreement and will continue to contribute such assets to the extent available on an ongoing basis in consideration for these contributions ssif has agreed in the support agreement to provide capital and liquidity support to the parent company and all of the beneficiary entities in accordance with the parent companys capital and liquidity policies under the support agreement the parent company is only permitted to retain cash needed to meet its upcoming obligations and to fund expected expenses during a potential bankruptcy proceeding ssif has provided the parent company with a committed credit line and issued and may issue one or more promissory notes to the parent company the parent company funding notes that together are intended to allow the parent company to continue to meet its obligations throughout the period prior to the occurrence of a recapitalization event which is defined under the support agreement as the earlier occurrence of one or more capital and liquidity thresholds being breached or the authorization by the parent companys board of directors for the parent company to commence bankruptcy proceedings the support agreement does not obligate ssif to maintain any specific level of resources and ssif may not have sufficient resources to implement the spoe strategy in the event a recapitalization event occurs the obligations outstanding under the parent company funding notes would automatically convert into or be exchanged for capital contributed to ssif the obligations of the parent company and ssif under the support agreement are secured through a security agreement that grants a lien on the assets that the parent company and ssif would use to fulfill their obligations under the support agreement to the beneficiary entities ssif is a distinct legal entity separate from the parent company and the parent companys other affiliates in accordance with our policies we are required to monitor on an ongoing basis the capital and liquidity needs of state street bank and our other beneficiary entities to support this process we have established a trigger framework that identifies key actions that would need to be taken or decisions that would need to be made if certain events tied to our financial condition occur the trigger thresholds are set at levels intended to provide for the availability of sufficient capital and liquidity to enable an orderly resolution without extraordinary government support that results in us emerging from resolution as a stabilized institution with market confidence restored upon the occurrence of a recapitalization event ssif would not be authorized to provide any further liquidity to the parent company the parent company would be required to contribute to ssif any remaining assets it is required to contribute to ssif under the support agreement which specifically exclude amounts designated to fund expected expenses during a potential bankruptcy proceeding ssif would be required to provide capital and liquidity support to the beneficiary entities to support such entities continued operation to the extent of its available resources and consistent with the support agreement and the parent company would be expected to commence chapter state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations proceedings under the us bankruptcy code no person or entity other than a party to the support agreement should rely on any of our affiliates being or remaining a beneficiary entity or receiving capital or liquidity support pursuant to the support agreement including in evaluating any of our entities from a creditors perspective or determining whether to enter into a contractual relationship with any of our entities state street bank is also required to submit periodically to the fdic a plan for resolution in the event of its failure referred to as an idi plan we submitted our last idi plan before july in november the fdic had announced that until the fdic completed revisions to its idi plan requirements no idi plans would be required to be filed on june the fdic issued a policy statement on resolution plans for idis that allows for content streamlining and adjusts the frequency of submissions to a threeyear cycle state street banks next idi plan submission deadline is december additionally we are required to submit a recovery plan to the federal reserve this plan includes detailed governance triggers and contingency actions that can be implemented in a timely manner in the event of extreme financial distress we also have recovery planning requirements in certain international jurisdictions where we operate funding deposits we provide products and services including custody accounting administration daily pricing fx services cash management financial asset management securities finance and investment advisory services as a provider of these products and services we generate client deposits which have generally provided a stable lowcost source of funds as a global custodian clients place deposits with our entities in various currencies as of both march and december approximately of our average total deposit balances were denominated in us dollars in eur in gbp and in all other currencies shortterm funding our onbalance sheet liquid assets are also an integral component of our liquidity management strategy these assets provide liquidity through maturities of the assets but more importantly they provide us with the ability to raise funds by pledging the securities as collateral for borrowings or through outright sales in addition our access to the global capital markets gives us the ability to source incremental funding from wholesale investors as discussed earlier under asset liquidity state street banks membership in the fhlb allows for advances of liquidity with varying terms against highquality collateral shortterm secured funding also comes in the form of securities lent or sold under agreements to repurchase these transactions are shortterm in nature generally overnight and are collateralized by highquality investment securities these balances were billion and billion as of march and december respectively state street bank continues to maintain a line of credit with a financial institution of cad billion or approximately billion as of march to support its canadian securities processing operations the line of credit has no stated termination date and is cancellable by either party with prior notice as of both march and december there was no balance outstanding on this line of credit longterm funding we have the ability to issue debt and equity securities under our current universal shelf registration statement to meet current commitments and business needs in addition state street bank also has current authorization from the board to issue unsecured senior debt the total amount remaining for issuance pursuant to this authority is billion as of march on january we issued million aggregate principal amount of fixedtofloating rate senior notes due and million aggregate principal amount of fixedtofloating rate senior notes due agency credit ratings our ability to maintain consistent access to liquidity is fostered by the maintenance of high investment grade ratings as measured by major credit rating agencies factors essential to maintaining high credit ratings include diverse and stable core earnings relative market position strong risk management strong capital ratios diverse liquidity sources including the global capital markets and client deposits strong liquidity monitoring procedures and preparedness for current or future regulatory developments high ratings limit borrowing costs and enhance our liquidity by providing confidence for unsecured funding and depositors increasing the potential market for our debt and improving our ability to offer products state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations facilitating reduced collateral haircuts in secured lending transactions and engaging in transactions in which clients value high credit ratings a downgrade or reduction in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity by restricting our ability to access the capital markets which could increase the related cost of funds in turn this could cause the sudden and largescale withdrawal of unsecured deposits by our clients which could lead to drawdowns of unfunded commitments to extend credit or trigger requirements under securities purchase commitments or require additional collateral or force terminations of certain trading derivative contracts a majority of our derivative contracts have been entered into under bilateral agreements with counterparties who may require us to post collateral or terminate the transactions based on changes in our credit ratings we assess the impact of these arrangements by determining the collateral that would be required assuming a downgrade by major rating agencies the additional collateral or termination payments related to our net

methodologies including var which is an estimate of potential loss for a given period within a stated statistical confidence interval we use a risk measurement methodology to measure tradingrelated var daily we have adopted standards for measuring tradingrelated var and we maintain regulatory capital for market risk associated with our trading activities in conformity with currently applicable bank regulatory market risk requirements our regulatory varbased measure is calculated based on historical volatilities of market risk factors during a twoyear observation period calibrated to a onetail confidence interval and a tenbusinessday holding period we calculate a stressed varbased measure using the same model we use to calculate var but with model inputs calibrated to historical data from a range of continuous twelvemonth periods that reflect significant financial stress the stressed var model is designed to identify the secondworst outcome occurring in the worst continuous oneyear rolling period since july this stressed var meets the regulatory requirement as the rolling tenday period with an outcome that is worse than of other outcomes during that twelvemonth period of financial stress for each portfolio the stress period is determined algorithmically by seeking the oneyear time horizon that produces the largest tenbusinessday var from within the available historical data this historical data set includes the financial crisis of the highly volatile period surrounding the eurozone sovereign debt crisis and the standard poors downgrade of us treasury debt

we have a corporatewide stress testing program in place that incorporates techniques to measure the potential loss we could suffer in a hypothetical scenario of adverse economic and financial conditions we also monitor concentrations of risk such as concentration by branch risk component and currency pairs we conduct stress testing on a daily basis based on selected historical stress events that are relevant to our positions in order to estimate the potential impact to our current portfolio should similar market conditions recur and we also perform stress testing as part of the federal reserves ccar process stress testing is conducted analyzed and reported at the corporate trading desk division and riskfactor level for example exchange risk interest rate risk and volatility risk stress testing results and limits are actively monitored on a daily basis by enterprise risk management erm and reported to the credit and market risk committee cmrc limit breaches are addressed by erm risk managers in conjunction with the business units escalated as appropriate and reviewed by the cmrc if material in addition we have established several action triggers that prompt review by management and the implementation of a remediation plan validation and backtesting we perform frequent backtesting to assess the accuracy of our varbased model in estimating loss at the stated confidence level this backtesting involves the comparison of estimated var model outputs to daily actual profitandloss pl outcomes observed from daily market movements we backtest our var model using clean pl which excludes nontrading revenue such as fees commissions and nii as well as estimated revenue from intraday trading our var definition of trading losses excludes items that are not specific to the price movement of the trading assets and liabilities themselves such as fees commissions changes to reserves and gains or losses from intraday activity we had zero backtesting exceptions in the quarter ended march we had one backtesting exception in the quarter ended december and one backtesting exception in the quarter ended march at a confidence interval the statistical expectation for a

of condition from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates while many market factors affect the level of nii and the economic value of our assets and liabilities one of the most significant factors is our exposure to movements in interest rates most of our nii is earned from the investment of client deposits generated by our businesses we invest these client deposits in assets that conform generally to the liquidity characteristics of our balance sheet liabilities as well as the currency composition of our significant nonus dollar denominated client deposits we quantify nii sensitivity using an earnings simulation model that includes our expectations for new business growth changes in balance sheet mix and investment portfolio positioning this measure compares our baseline view of nii over a twelvemonth horizon based on our internal forecast of interest rates to a wide range of rate shocks our baseline view of nii is updated on a regular basis table key interest rates for baseline forecasts presents the spot and 12month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts at march and our baseline rate forecast as of march was generally consistent with

condition and results of operations model risk management the use of models is widespread throughout the financial services industry with large and complex organizations relying on sophisticated models to support numerous aspects of their financial decision making the models contemporaneously represent both a significant advancement in financial management and a source of risk in large banking organizations like us model results influence business decisions and model failure could have a harmful effect on our financial performance as a result the model risk management framework seeks to mitigate our model risk for additional information about our model risk management framework including our governance and model validation refer to pages to included under item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations model risk management in our form 10k strategic risk management we define strategic risk as the current or prospective impact on earnings or capital arising from adverse business decisions improper implementation of strategic initiatives or lack of responsiveness to industrywide changes strategic risks are influenced by changes in the competitive environment decline in market performance or changes in our business activities and the potential secondary impacts of reputational risks not already captured as market interest rate credit operational model or liquidity risks we incorporate strategic risk into our assessment of our business plans and risk and capital management processes management of strategic risk is an integral component of all aspects of our business separating the effects of a potential material adverse event into operational and strategic risk is sometimes difficult for instance the direct financial impact of an unfavorable event in the form of fines or penalties would be classified as an operational risk loss while the impact on our reputation and consequently the potential loss of clients and corresponding decline in revenue would be classified as a strategic risk loss an additional example of strategic risk is the integration of a major acquisition failure to successfully integrate the operations of an acquired business and the resultant inability to retain clients and the associated revenue would be classified as a loss due to strategic risk strategic risk is managed with a longterm focus techniques for its assessment and management include the development of business plans which are subject to review and challenge from senior management and the board of directors as well as a formal review and approval process for all new business and product proposals the potential impact of the various elements of strategic risk is difficult to quantify with any degree of precision we use a combination of historical earnings volatility scenario analysis stresstesting and management judgment to help assess the potential effect on us attributable to strategic risk management and control of strategic risks are generally the responsibility of the business units with oversight from the control functions as part of their overall strategic planning and internal risk management processes capital managing our capital involves evaluating whether our actual and projected levels of capital are commensurate with our risk profile are in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements and are sufficient to provide us with the financial flexibility to undertake future strategic business initiatives we assess capital adequacy based on relevant regulatory capital requirements as well as our own internal capital goals targets and other relevant metrics our designation as a gsib is based on a number of factors as evaluated by banking regulators and requires us to maintain an additional capital surcharge above the minimum capital ratios set forth in the basel iii final rule further like all other us gsibs we are also currently subject to a slr buffer in addition to the required minimum of under the basel iii final rule if we fail to exceed any regulatory buffer or surcharge we will be subject to increased restrictions depending upon the extent of the shortfall regarding capital distributions and discretionary executive bonus payments not all of our competitors have similarly been designated as systemically important nor are all of them subject to the same degree of regulation as a bank or financial holding company and therefore some of our competitors may not be subject to the same capital liquidity and other regulatory

are subject to the us basel iii framework we are also subject to the final market risk capital rule issued by us banking regulators the basel iii final rule provides for two frameworks for monitoring capital adequacy the standardized approach and the advanced approaches applicable to advanced approaches banking organizations like us the standardized approach prescribes standardized calculations for credit risk rwa including specified risk weights for certain on and offbalance sheet exposures the advanced approaches consist of the advanced internal ratingsbased approach used for the calculation of rwa related to credit risk and the advanced measurement approach used for the calculation of rwa related to operational risk as required by the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act enacted in we and state street bank as advanced approaches banking organizations are subject to a capital floor also referred to as the collins amendment in the assessment of our regulatory capital adequacy such that our riskbased capital ratios for regulatory assessment purposes are the lower of each ratio calculated under the advanced approaches and the standardized approach under the advanced approaches state street and state street bank are subject to a ccb requirement plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer requirement which is currently set at under the standardized approach state street bank is subject to the same ccb and countercyclical capital buffer requirements but for state street the ccb requirement is replaced by the scb requirement according to the scb rule issued in in addition state street is subject to a gsib surcharge the scb replaced under the standardized approach the ccb with a buffer calculated as the difference between the institutions starting and lowest projected cet1 ratio under the ccar severely adverse scenario plus planned common stock dividend payments as a percentage of rwa from the fourth through seventh quarter of the ccar planning horizon the scb requirement can be no less than of rwa breaching the scb or other regulatory buffer or surcharge will limit a banking organizations ability to make capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers the countercyclical capital buffer is currently set at zero by us banking regulators on june we were notified by the federal reserve of the results from the supervisory stress test our scb calculated under this supervisory stress test was well below the minimum resulting in an scb at that floor which was effective starting october and will run through september our minimum riskbased capital ratios as of january include a ccb of and a scb of for the advanced approaches and standardized approach respectively a gsib

company we and our insured depository institution subsidiaries are required among other requirements to be well capitalized as defined by regulation y and regulation h the market risk capital rule requires us to use internal models to calculate daily measures of var which reflect general market risk for certain of our trading positions defined by the rule as covered positions as well as stressedvar measures to supplement the var measures the rule also requires a public disclosure composed of qualitative and quantitative information about the market risk associated with our trading activities and our related var and stressedvar measures the qualitative and quantitative information required by the rule is provided under market risk management included in this managements discussion and analysis on september the federal reserve vice chair for supervision stated that the federal reserve was undertaking a holistic review of us capital requirements that will help the

judgment by us and our regulators and our advanced systems may not individually or collectively precisely represent or calculate the scenarios circumstances outputs or other results for which they are designed or intended our advanced systems are subject to update and periodic revalidation in response to changes in our business activities and our historical experiences forces and events experienced by the market broadly or by individual financial institutions changes in regulations and regulatory interpretations and other factors and are also subject to continuing regulatory review and approval for example a significant operational loss experienced by another financial institution even if we do not experience a related loss could result in a material change in the output of our advanced systems and a corresponding material change in our risk exposures our total rwa and our capital ratios compared to prior periods an operational loss that we experience could also result in a material change in our capital requirements for operational risk under the advanced approaches depending on the severity of the loss event its characterization among the seven baseldefined uom and the stability of the distributional approach for a particular uom and without direct correlation to the effects of the loss event or the timing of such effects on our results of operations due to the influence of changes in these advanced systems whether resulting from changes in data inputs regulation or regulatory supervision or interpretation specific to us or market activities or experiences

balance sheet exposures in a manner consistent with regulatory guidance and the availability of interim solutions for various legacy libor contracts we will not originate or issue new liborbased loans or longterm debt and any purchases of liborbased investment securities will be screened for adequate fallback language our remaining exposure outstanding at the end of june is largely governed by existing fallback language or the libor act which provides for appropriate fallback provisions substantial risks and uncertainties are associated with the market transition away from the use of libor
