are located at one lincoln street boston massachusetts telephone for purposes of this s and reports we use acronyms and other defined terms for certain business terms and abbreviations as defined on the acronyms list and glossary under item in this cycle for the us gsibs including state street this cycle alternates between a targeted resolution plan followed two years later by a full resolution plan the agencies have published the scope for the upcoming targeted resolution plan to include the core elements of resolution planning and some specific firm level information including impacts from the covid19 pandemic the next resolution plan is due on july in the event of material financial distress or failure our preferred resolution strategy is the spoe strategy the spoe strategy provides that prior to the bankruptcy of the parent company and pursuant to a support agreement among the parent company ssif a direct subsidiary of the parent company our beneficiary entities as defined below and certain of our other entities ssif is obligated up to its available resources to recapitalize andor provide liquidity to state street bank and the other entities benefiting from such capital andor liquidity support collectively with state street bank beneficiary entities in amounts designed to prevent the beneficiary entities from themselves entering into resolution proceedings following the recapitalization of or provision of liquidity to the beneficiary entities the parent company would enter into a bankruptcy proceeding under the us bankruptcy code the beneficiary entities and our other subsidiaries would be transferred to a newly organized holding company held by a reorganization trust for the benefit of the parent companys claimants under the support agreement the parent company prefunded ssif by contributing certain of its assets primarily its liquid assets cash deposits investments in intercompany debt investments in marketable securities and other cash and noncash equivalent investments to ssif at the time it entered into the support agreement and will continue to contribute such assets to the extent available on an ongoing basis in consideration for these contributions ssif has agreed in the support agreement to provide capital and liquidity support to the parent company and all of the beneficiary entities in accordance with the parent companys capital and liquidity policies under the support agreement the parent company is only permitted to retain cash needed to meet its upcoming obligations and to fund expected expenses during a potential bankruptcy proceeding ssif has provided the parent state street corporation company with a committed credit line and issued and may issue one or more promissory notes to the parent company the parent company funding notes that together are intended to allow the parent company to continue to meet its obligations throughout the period prior to the occurrence of a recapitalization event as defined below the support agreement does not obligate ssif to maintain any specific level of resources and ssif may not have sufficient resources to implement the spoe strategy in the event a recapitalization event occurs the obligations outstanding under the parent company funding notes would automatically convert into or be exchanged for capital contributed to ssif the obligations of the parent company and ssif under the support agreement are secured through a security agreement that grants a lien on the assets that the parent company and ssif would use to fulfill their obligations under the support agreement to the beneficiary entities ssif is a distinct legal entity separate from the parent company and the parent companys other affiliates in accordance with our policies we are required to monitor on an ongoing basis the capital and liquidity needs of state street bank and our other beneficiary entities to support this process we have established a trigger framework that identifies key actions that would need to be taken or decisions that would need to be made if certain events tied to our financial condition occur in the event that we experience material financial distress the support agreement requires us to model and calculate certain capital and liquidity triggers on a regular basis to determine whether or not the parent company should commence preparations for a bankruptcy filing and whether or not a recapitalization event has occurred upon the occurrence of a recapitalization event ssif would not be authorized to provide any further liquidity to the parent company the parent company would be required to contribute to ssif any remaining assets it is required to contribute to ssif under the support agreement which specifically exclude amounts designated to fund expected expenses during a potential bankruptcy proceeding ssif would be required to provide capital and liquidity support to the beneficiary entities to support such entities continued operation to the extent of its available resources and consistent with the support agreement and the parent company would be expected to commence chapter proceedings under the us bankruptcy code no person or entity other than a party to the support agreement should rely on any of our affiliates being or remaining a beneficiary entity or receiving capital or liquidity support pursuant to the support agreement including in evaluating any of our entities from a creditors perspective or determining whether to enter into a contractual relationship with any of our entities a recapitalization event is defined under the support agreement as the earlier occurrence of one or more capital and liquidity thresholds being breached or the authorization by the parent companys board of directors for the parent company to commence bankruptcy proceedings the thresholds are set at levels intended to provide for the availability of sufficient capital and liquidity to enable an orderly resolution without extraordinary government support the spoe strategy and the obligations under the support agreement may result in the recapitalization of state street bank and the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings by the parent company at an earlier stage of financial stress than might otherwise occur without such mechanisms in place an expected effect of the spoe strategy and applicable tlac regulatory requirements is that our losses will be imposed on the parent company shareholders and the holders of longterm debt and other forms of tlac securities currently outstanding or issued in the future by the parent company as well as on any other parent company creditors before any of our losses are imposed on the holders of the debt securities of the parent companys operating subsidiaries

institution during the assessment period for larger institutions such as state street bank assessments are determined based on regulatory ratings and forwardlooking financial measures to calculate the assessment rate which is subject to adjustments by the fdic and the assessment base the fdic is required to determine whether and to what extent adjustments to the assessment base are appropriate for

other events the fdic has the ability to transfer any of the depository institutions assets and liabilities to a new obligor without the approval of the depository institutions creditors enforce the terms of the depository institutions contracts pursuant to their terms or repudiate or disaffirm contracts or leases to which the depository institution is a party additionally the claims of holders of deposit liabilities and certain claims for administrative expenses against an insured depository institution would be afforded priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution including claims of debt holders of the institution and under current interpretation depositors in nonus branches and offices in the liquidation or other resolution of such an institution by any receiver as a result such persons would be treated differently from and could receive if anything substantially less than the depositors in us offices of the depository institution cyber risk management in october the federal reserve fdic and occ issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding enhanced cyber risk management standards which would apply to a wide range of large
