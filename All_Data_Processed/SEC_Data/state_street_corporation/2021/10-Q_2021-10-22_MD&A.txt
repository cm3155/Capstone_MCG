whereas as of december approximately of our average total deposit balances were denominated in us dollars approximately in eur in the british pound sterling gbp and in all other currencies shortterm funding our onbalance sheet liquid assets are also an integral component of our liquidity management strategy these assets provide liquidity through maturities of the assets but more importantly they provide us with the ability to raise funds by pledging the securities as collateral for borrowings or through outright sales in addition our access to the global capital markets gives us the ability to source incremental funding from wholesale investors as discussed earlier under asset liquidity state street banks membership in the fhlb allows for advances of liquidity with varying terms against highquality collateral shortterm secured funding also comes in the form of securities lent or sold under agreements to repurchase these transactions are shortterm in nature generally overnight and are

potential market for our debt and improving our ability tooffer products serving markets and engaging in transactions in which clients value high credit ratingsa downgrade or reduction of our credit ratings could have a materialadverse effect on our liquidity by restricting our ability to access the capitalmarkets which could increase the related cost of funds in turn this could causethe sudden

inputs calibrated to historical data from a range of continuous twelvemonth periods that reflect significant financial stress the stressed var model is designed to identify the secondworst outcome occurring in the worst continuous oneyear rolling period since july this stressed var meets the regulatory requirement as the rolling tenday period with an outcome that is worse than of other outcomes during that twelvemonth period of financial stress for each portfolio the stress period is determined algorithmically by seeking the oneyear time horizon that produces the largest tenbusinessday var from within the available historical data this historical data set includes the financial crisis of the highly volatile period surrounding the eurozone sovereign debt crisis and the standard poors

provide sustainable nii under varying economic conditions while protecting the economic value of theassets and liabilities carried on our consolidated statement of condition from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates while many market factors affect the level of niiand the economic value of our assets and liabilities one of the most significant factors is our exposure to movements in interest rates most of our nii is earned from theinvestment of client deposits generated by our businesses we invest these client deposits in assets that conform generally to the characteristics of

results of operationsas of september nii and us dollar nii is expected to benefit from both parallel increases and decreases in interest rates compared to september our nii and us dollar nii is more sensitive to parallel rate increases primarily due to higher levels of client deposits our projection of an nii benefit to an upward rate shock of 100bps assumes deposit betas remain low consistent with the last rising rate cycle our projection also assumes that deposit levels remain relatively consistent with third quarter averages we expect that our nii benefit in the 100bps scenarios would be lower if deposits levels decline in a rising rate environment compared to september our nii and us dollar nii benefit to lower rates has increased primarily due to growth in fixed and contractually floored securities and loans our projection of an nii benefit from a downward rate shock of bps assumes negative interest rates are charged on client deposits and contractual floors are reached on our securities and loans nii is also exposed to smaller shocks to shortend us interest rates if shortend us market interest rates increase or decrease by bps we estimate the annualized impact to be approximately million in higher or lower nii primarily due to the impact on our sponsored repo activity nii is still positioned to benefit from changes in nonus interest rates with the majority of our sensitivity derived from the shortend of the curve given deposit pricing expectations compared to september our nonus benefit from higher rates increased due to higher nonus deposit balances our
