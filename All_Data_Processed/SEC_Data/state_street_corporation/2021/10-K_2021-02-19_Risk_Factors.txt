item risk factors risk factors in the normal course of our business activities we are exposed to a variety of risks the following is a discussion of material risk factors applicable to us additional information about our risk management framework is included under risk management in managements discussion and analysis in this form 10k additional risks beyond those described in our managements discussion and analysis or in the following discussion may apply to our activities or operations as currently conducted or as we may conduct them in the future or in the markets in which we operate or may in the future operate strategic risks we are subject to intense competition in all aspects of our business which could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability the markets in which we operate across all facets of our business are both highly competitive and global these markets are changing as a result of new and evolving laws and regulations applicable to financial services institutions regulatorydriven market changes cannot always be anticipated and may adversely affect the demand for and profitability of the products and services that we offer in addition new market entrants and competitors may address changes in the markets more rapidly than we do may have materially greater resources to invest in infrastructure and product development than we do or may provide clients with a more attractive offering of products and services adversely affecting our state street corporation business our efforts to develop and market new products particularly in the fintech sector may position us in new markets with preexisting competitors with strong market position we have also experienced and anticipate that we will continue to experience significant pricing pressure in many of our core businesses particularly our custodial and investment management services this pricing pressure has and may continue to impact our revenue growth and operational margins and may limit the positive impact of new client demand and growth in auca many of our businesses compete with other domestic and international banks and financial services companies such as custody banks investment advisors brokerdealers outsourcing companies and data processing companies further consolidation within the financial services industry could also pose challenges to us in the markets we serve including potentially increased downward pricing pressure across our businesses some of our competitors including our competitors in core services have substantially greater capital resources than we do are not subject to as stringent capital or other regulatory requirements as we are or may not be as constrained as we are by these requirements due to the relative size of our balance sheet in some of our businesses we are service providers to significant competitors these competitors are in some instances significant clients and the retention of these clients involves additional risks such as the avoidance of actual or perceived conflicts of interest and the maintenance of high levels of service quality and intracompany confidentiality the ability of a competitor to offer comparable or improved products or services at a lower price would likely negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability many of our core services are subject to contracts that have relatively short terms or may be terminated by our client after a short notice period in addition pricing pressures as a result of the activities of competitors client pricing reviews and rebids as well as the introduction of new products may result in a reduction in the prices we can charge for our products and services we are subject to variability in our assets under custody andor administration and assets under management and in our financial results due to the significant size of many of our institutional clients and are also subject to significant pricing pressure due to the considerable market influence exerted by those clients our clients include institutional investors such as mutual funds collective investment funds ucits hedge funds and other investment pools corporate and public retirement plans insurance companies foundations endowments and investment managers in both our asset servicing and asset management businesses we endeavor to attract institutional investors controlling large and diverse pools of assets as those clients typically have the opportunity to benefit from the full range of our expertise and service offerings due to the large pools of assets controlled by these clients the loss or gain of one client or even a portion of the assets controlled by one client could have a significant effect on our auca or our aum as applicable in the relevant period loss of all or a portion of the servicing of a clients assets can occur for a variety of reasons f or example as a result of a decision to diversify providers one of our large asset servicing clients has advised us it expects to move a significant portion of its etf assets currently with state street to one or more other providers pending necessary approvals the transition is expected to begin in but will principally occur in for the year ended december the fee revenue associated with the transitioning assets represented approximately of our total fee revenue our aum or auca are also affected by decisions by institutional owners to favor or disfavor certain investment instruments or categories similarly if one or more clients change the asset class in which a significant portion of assets are invested eg by shifting investments from emerging markets to the us those changes could have a significant effect on our results of operations in the relevant period as our fee rates often change based on the type of asset classes we are servicing or managing as our fee revenue is significantly impacted by our levels of auca and aum changes in levels of different asset classes could have a corresponding significant effect on our results of operations in the relevant period large institutional clients also by their nature are often able to exert considerable market influence and this combined with strong competitive forces in the markets for our services has resulted in and may continue to result in significant pressure to reduce the fees we charge for our services in both our asset servicing and asset management lines of business our strategy of focusing our efforts on the segments of the market for investor services represented by very large asset managers and asset owners causes us to be particularly impacted by this industry trend many of these large clients are also under competitive and regulatory pressures that are driving them to manage the expenses that they and their investment products incur more aggressively which in turn exacerbates their pressures on our fees development and completion of new products and services including state street alpha may impose costs on us involve dependencies on third parties and may expose us to increased operational and model risk our financial performance depends in part on our ability to develop and market new and innovative services and to adopt or develop new technologies that differentiate our products or provide cost efficiencies while avoiding increased related state street corporation expenses this dependency is exacerbated in the current fintech environment where financial institutions are investing significantly in evaluating new technologies such as distributed ledger technology blockchain and developing potentially industrychanging products services and standards for example in we acquired crd and are leveraging the capabilities acquired to create state street alpha by combining with offerings from our investment servicing business line the introduction of new products and services can require significant time and resources including regulatory approvals and the development and implementation of technical data management control and model validation requirements and effective security and resiliency elements new products and services such as state street alpha often also involve dependencies on third parties to among other things access innovative technologies develop new distribution channels or form collaborative product and service offerings and can require complex strategic alliances and joint venture relationships substantial risks and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services strategic alliances and joint ventures including rapid technological change in the industry our ability to access technical data and other information from our clients significant and ongoing investments required to bring new products and services to market in a timely manner at competitive prices sharing of benefits in those relationships conflicts with existing business partners and clients protection of intellectual property the competition for employees with the necessary expertise and experience and sales and other materials that fully and accurately describe the product or service and its underlying risks and are compliant with applicable regulations new products or services may fail to operate or perform as expected and may not be suitable for the intended client or may not produce anticipated efficiencies savings or benefits for either the client or us our failure to manage these risks and uncertainties also exposes us to enhanced risk of operational lapses which may result in the recognition of financial statement liabilities regulatory and internal control requirements capital requirements competitive alternatives vendor relationships and shifting market preferences may also determine if such initiatives can be brought to market in a manner that is timely and attractive to our clients failure to successfully manage all of the above risks in the development and implementation of new products or services including completion of state street alpha could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation consolidated results of operations or financial condition our business may be negatively affected by our failure to update and maintain our technology infrastructure in order to maintain and grow our business we must make strategic decisions about our current and future business plans and effectively execute upon those plans strategic initiatives that we are currently developing or executing against include cost initiatives enhancements and efficiencies to our operational processes improvements to existing and new service offerings targeting for sales growth certain segments of the markets for investor services and asset management and enhancements to existing and development of new information technology and other systems implementing strategic programs and creating cost efficiencies involves certain strategic technological and operational risks many features of our present initiatives include investment in systems integration and new technologies and also the development of new and the evolution of existing methods and tools to accelerate the pace of innovation the introduction of new services and enhancements to the resiliency of our systems and operations these initiatives also may result in increased or unanticipated costs or earnings volatility may take longer than anticipated to implement and may result in increases in operating losses inadvertent data disclosures or other operating errors in implementing these programs we may have material dependencies on third parties the transition to new operating processes and technology infrastructure may also cause disruptions in our relationships with clients and employees or loss of institutional understanding and may present other unanticipated technical or operational hurdles in addition the relocation to or expansion of servicing activities and other operations in different geographic regions or vendors may entail client regulatory and other third party data use storage and security challenges as well as other regulatory compliance business continuity and other considerations as a result we may not achieve some or all of the anticipated cost savings or other benefits and may experience unanticipated challenges from clients regulators or other parties or reputational harm in addition some systems development initiatives may not have access to significant resources or management attention and consequently may be delayed or unsuccessful many of our systems require enhancements to meet the requirements of evolving regulation to enhance security and resiliency and decommission obsolete technologies to permit us to optimize our use of capital or to reduce the risk of operating error in addition the implementation of our state street alpha platform and integration of crd requires substantial systems development and expense we may not have the state street corporation resources to pursue all of these objectives simultaneously the covid19 pandemic continues to create significant risks and uncertainties for our business the extent to which the covid19 pandemic continues to impact our business results of operations and financial condition as well as our regulatory capital and liquidity ratios and other regulatory requirements in the united states and internationally will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including the scope and duration of the pandemic the effectiveness of our work from home arrangements and staffing levels in operational facilities challenges associated with our return to office plans such as maintaining a safe office environment and integrating athome and inoffice staff the impact of market participants on which we rely actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic and the impact of equity market valuations and extended sales and implementation cycles for some clients on our service and management fee revenue the covid19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy caused fluctuations in equity market valuations at times decreased liquidity in fixed income markets created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets increased unemployment levels and disrupted global supply chains this has created at peak periods of volatility extraordinary demand on our transaction processing capabilities in our asset servicing business and volatility in our foreign exchange and asset management businesses the market and economic uncertainty has also increased the risks inherent in our activities as a credit provider to investment pools and other institutional investors and caused us to increase our provision for credit losses in addition our and other market participants reliance upon work from home capabilities and the potential inability to maintain critical staff in our operational facilities including facilities in the united states the united kingdom germany china india and poland present risks associated with our and local infrastructure increasingly restrictive local regulations illness quarantine the sustainability of a work from home environment and increased risk of cybersecurity attacks any material or extended disruption of our ability to deliver services or meet our responsibilities in the settlement of securities or other market activities is likely to result in operating losses loss of revenue or penalties under our service contracts which may have a material adverse impact on our results of operation and financial condition moreover governmental actions in response to the pandemic are meaningfully influencing the interest rate environment which has reduced and may continue to reduce our net interest income and net interest margin in march we announced together with the other usbased gsibs that we temporarily suspended our common stock repurchase program in light of the covid19 pandemic subsequently in connection with a requirement for all ccar banking organizations including state street to participate in additional supervisory capital stress tests due to the challenges created by the covid19 pandemic the federal reserve limited the ability of all ccar banking organizations to make capital distributions for the remainder of as a result we did not return capital to shareholders in the form of common stock repurchases during the nine months ended december in december we announced following the results of the additional stress test that we have been authorized to continue to pay common stock dividends at current levels and to resume purchasing common shares in the first quarter of in the aggregate amount up to the average of our quarterly net income during however there can be no assurance the federal reserve will not require additional stress testing modify existing or apply new limitations on distributions of capital to shareholders or introduce new or additional regulatory actions restrictions or requirements in connection with the covid19 pandemic or associated market or industry developments where permitted consistent with regulatory standards the timing of stock purchases types of transactions and number of shares purchased under our stock purchase programs will depend on several factors including market conditions and our capital positions financial performance and investment opportunities our common stock purchase programs do not have specific price targets and may be suspended at any time acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures and divestitures pose risks for our business as part of our business strategy we acquire complementary businesses and technologies enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures and divest portions of our business we undertake transactions of varying sizes to among other reasons expand our geographic footprint access new clients distribution channels technologies or services develop closer or more collaborative relationships with our business partners efficiently deploy capital or leverage cost savings or other business or financial opportunities we may not achieve the expected benefits of these transactions which could result in increased costs lowered revenues ineffective deployment of capital regulatory concerns exit costs or diminished competitive position or reputation transactions of this nature also involve a number of risks and financial accounting tax regulatory strategic managerial operational cultural and employment challenges which could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and state street corporation financial condition for example the businesses that we acquire or our strategic alliances or joint ventures may underperform relative to the price paid or the resources committed by us we may not achieve anticipated revenue growth or cost savings or we may otherwise be adversely affected by acquisitionrelated charges the intellectual property of an acquired business may be an important component of the value that we agree to pay for it however such acquisitions are subject to the risks that the acquired business may not own the intellectual property that we believe we are acquiring that the intellectual property is dependent on licenses from third parties that the acquired business infringes on the intellectual property rights of others that the technology does not have the acceptance in the marketplace that we anticipated or that the technology requires significant investment to remain competitive similarly such acquisitions present risks on our ability to retain the acquired talent which may be essential to achieve our objectives in the acquisition the integration of an acquired businesss information technology infrastructure into ours has in the past and may in the future also expose us to additional security and resiliency risks further past acquisitions have resulted in the recognition of goodwill and other significant intangible assets in our consolidated statement of condition for example we recorded goodwill and intangible assets of approximately billion associated with our acquisition of crd in these assets are not eligible for inclusion in regulatory capital under applicable requirements in addition we may be required to record impairment in our consolidated statement of income in future periods if we determine that the value of these assets has declined through our acquisitions or joint ventures we may also assume unknown or undisclosed business operational tax regulatory and other liabilities fail to properly assess known contingent liabilities or assume businesses with internal control deficiencies while in most of our transactions we seek to mitigate these risks through among other things due diligence indemnification provisions or insurance these or other riskmitigating provisions we put in place may not be sufficient to address these liabilities and contingencies and involve credit and execution risks associated with successfully seeking recourse from a third party such as the seller or an insurance provider other major financial services firms have recently paid significant penalties to resolve government investigations into matters conducted in significant part by acquired entities various regulatory approvals or consents formal or informal are generally required prior to closing of these transactions which may include approvals nonobjections or regulatory exceptions from the federal reserve and other domestic and nonus regulatory authorities these regulatory authorities may impose conditions on the completion of the acquisition or require changes to its terms that materially affect the terms of the transaction or our ability to capture some of the opportunities presented by the transaction or may not approve the transaction any such conditions or any associated regulatory delays could limit the benefits of the transaction acquisitions or joint ventures we announce may not be completed if we do not receive the required regulatory approvals if regulatory approvals are significantly delayed or if other closing conditions are not satisfied the integration and the retention and development of the benefits of our acquisitions result in risks to our business and other uncertainties in recent years we have undertaken several acquisitions including our acquisition of crd and our acquisition of the general electric asset management geam business the integration of acquisitions presents risks that differ from the risks associated with our ongoing operations integration activities are complicated and time consuming and can involve significant unforeseen costs we may not be able to effectively assimilate services technologies key personnel or businesses of acquired companies into our business or service offerings as anticipated and we may not achieve related revenue growth or cost savings we also face the risk of being unable to retain or crosssell our products or services to the clients of acquired companies or joint ventures and the risk of being unable to crosssell acquired products or services to our existing clients in particular some clients including significant clients of an acquired business may have the right to transition their business to other providers on short notice for convenience fiduciary or other reasons and may take the opportunity of the acquisition or market commercial relationship service satisfaction or other developments following the acquisition to terminate reduce or renegotiate the fees or other terms of our relationship any such client losses reductions or renegotiations likely will reduce the expected benefits of the acquisition including revenues crossselling opportunities and market share cause impairment to goodwill and other intangibles or result in reputational harm which effects could be material and we may not have recourse against the seller of the business or the client the risk of client loss is even greater where the client is a competitor of ours acquisitions of technology firms can involve extensive information technology integration with associated risk of defects security breaches and resiliency lapses and product enhancement and development activities the costs of which can be difficult to estimate as well as heightened cultural and compliance concerns in state street corporation integrating an unregulated firm into a bank regulatory environment acquisitions of investment servicing businesses entail information technology systems conversions which involve operational risks as well as fiduciary and other risks associated with client retention acquisitions of asset management businesses similarly involve fiduciary and similar risks associated with client retention distribution channels and additional servicing opportunities joint ventures involve all of these risks as well as risks associated with shared control and decisionmaking even in majorityowned situations minority rights and exit rights which can delay challenge or foreclose execution on material opportunities or initiatives create regulatory risks and limit divestment opportunities with any acquisition the integration of the operations and resources of the businesses could result in the loss of key employees the disruption of our and the acquired companys ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures or policies that could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients business partners or employees maintain regulatory compliance or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition integration efforts may also divert management attention and resources integration of crd and its business operations and employees with our own may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost synergies of the acquisition may not be fully realized which could adversely impact our business operations financial condition and results of operations we completed our acquisition of crd on october the success of the acquisition including the achievement of anticipated growth opportunities and cost synergies of the acquisition continues to be subject to a number of uncertainties and will depend in part on our ability to successfully combine and integrate crds business into our business in an efficient and effective manner the combined company may face significant challenges in implementing such integration including challenges related to integrating crds business into our own in a manner that permits the combined company to achieve the cost and operating synergies anticipated to result from the acquisition which could result in the anticipated benefits of the acquisition not being realized partly or wholly in the time frame currently anticipated or at all retaining crds clients some of which are our competitors retaining key management and technical personnel integrating crds software solutions with our existing products and services and related operations and systems including performance risk and compliance analytics investment manager operations outsourcing accounting administration and custody accelerating the development of enhancements to the features and functions of crds software solutions coordinating and integrating our internal operations compensation programs policies and procedures and corporate structures potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen or increased costs and expenses the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding potential synergies and the integration process incurring significant acquisitionrelated costs and expenses associated with combining our operations and performance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of managements attention and resources caused by integrating the companies operations any of these factors could result in our failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition on the expected timeline or at all and could adversely impact our business operations financial condition and results of operations competition for qualified members of our workforce is intense and we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our business our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel competition for the best people in most activities in which we engage can be intense and we may not be able to hire people or retain them particularly in light of challenges associated with compensation restrictions applicable or which may become applicable to banks and some asset managers and that are not applicable to other financial services firms in all jurisdictions or to technology firms generally the unexpected loss of services of key personnel in business units control functions information technology operations or other areas could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills their knowledge of our markets operations and clients their years of industry experience and in some cases the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel similarly the loss of key personnel either individually or as a group could adversely affect our clients perception of our ability to continue to manage certain types of investment management mandates to provide other services to state street corporation them or to maintain a culture of innovation and proficiency financial market risks geopolitical and economic conditions and developments could adversely affect us particularly if we face increased uncertainty and unpredictability in managing our businesses global financial markets can suffer from substantial volatility illiquidity and disruption particularly as a result of geopolitical disruptions slower economic growth and a shifting monetary policy stance from key central banks if such volatility illiquidity or disruption were to result in an adverse economic environment in the us or internationally or result in a lack of confidence in the financial stability of major developed or emerging markets such developments could have an adverse effect on our business as well as the businesses of our clients and our significant counterparties and could also increase the difficulty and unpredictability of aligning our business strategies our infrastructure and our operating costs in light of uncertain market and economic conditions these risks could be compounded by tighter monetary policy conditions disruptions to free trade and political uncertainty in the us and internationally market disruptions can adversely affect our consolidated results of operations if the value of our auca or aum decline while the costs of providing the related services remain constant or increase they may also result in investor preference trends towards asset classes and markets deemed more secure such as cash or nonemerging markets with respect to which our fee rates are often lower these factors could reduce the profitability of our assetbased fee revenue and could also adversely affect our transactionbased revenue such as revenues from securities finance and foreign exchange activities and the volume of transactions that we execute for or with our clients further the degree of volatility in foreign exchange rates can affect our foreign exchange trading revenue in general increased currency volatility tends to increase our market risk but also increases our opportunity to generate foreign exchange revenue conversely periods of lower currency volatility tend to decrease our market risk but also decrease our foreign exchange revenue in addition as our business grows globally and a significant percentage of our revenue is earned and of our expenses paid in currencies other than us dollars our exposure to foreign currency volatility could affect our levels of consolidated revenue our consolidated expenses and our consolidated results of operations as well as the value of our investment in our nonus operations and our nonus investment portfolio holdings the extent to which changes in the strength of the us dollar relative to other currencies affect our consolidated results of operations including the degree of any offset between increases or decreases to both revenue and expenses will depend upon the nature and scope of our operations and activities in the relevant jurisdictions during the relevant periods which may vary from period to period as our product offerings expand in part as we seek to take advantage of perceived opportunities arising under various regulatory reforms and resulting market changes the degree of our exposure to various market and credit risks will evolve potentially resulting in greater revenue volatility our businesses have significant international operations and disruptions in european and asian economies could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition european economic growth has faced significant impacts from the covid19 pandemic notably with growth in the european union expected to contract markedly in new or continued economic deterioration will renew concerns about sovereign debt sustainability interdependencies among financial institutions and sovereigns and political and other risks despite stimulus from central banks continued uncertainty in the external environment has led to increased concern around the near to mediumterm outlook for economic progress in the regions in which we operate including europe and asia in addition uncertainty around implications of the united kingdoms exit from the eu known as brexit and related developments present risks which include potential negative impacts to economic activity or to cooperation in the future relationship between the uk and eu and the resulting consequences for market access for financial services in order to conform to anticipated restrictions on activity between the eu and the uk following brexit we have developed and implemented plans that seek to maintain our servicing and operational capabilities in all material respects independent of the final outcome there can be no assurance however that our plans will address effectively in whole or in part all potential contingencies associated with brexit or that we may not experience additional costs or inefficiencies associated with our european activities or client dissatisfaction delays in receiving regulatory approvals or other difficulties in executing our regional strategy given the scope of our international operations economic or market uncertainty volatility illiquidity or disruption resulting from these and related factors could have a material adverse impact on our state street corporation consolidated results of operations or financial condition our investment securities portfolio consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in market factors including interest rates credit spreads and credit performance our investment securities portfolio represented approximately of our total assets as of december the gross interest income associated with our investment portfolio represented approximately of our total gross revenue for the year ended december and has represented as much as of our total gross revenue in the fiscal years since as such our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are materially exposed to the risks associated with our investment portfolio including changes in interest rates credit spreads credit performance including risk of default credit ratings our access to liquidity foreign exchange markets and mark tomarket valuations and our ability to profitably manage changes in repayment rates of principal with respect to our portfolio securities the continued low interest rate environment that has persisted since the financial crisis began in mid2007 limits our ability to achieve a nim consistent with our prior historical averages in addition certain regulatory liquidity standards such as the lcr require that we maintain minimum levels of hqla in our investment portfolio which generally generate lower rates of return than other investment assets this has resulted in increased levels of hqla as a percentage of our investment portfolio and an associated negative impact on our nii and our nim as a result we may not be able to attain our prior historical levels of nii and nim for additional information regarding these liquidity requirements refer to the liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio section of supervision and regulation in business in this form 10k we may enter into derivative transactions to hedge or manage our exposure to interest rate risk as well as other risks such as foreign exchange risk and credit risk derivative instruments that we hold for these or other purposes may not achieve their intended results and could result in unexpected losses or stresses on our liquidity or capital resources our investment securities portfolio represents a greater proportion of our consolidated statement of condition and our loan portfolio represents a smaller proportion approximately of our total assets as of december in comparison to many other major financial institutions in some respects the accounting and regulatory treatment of our investment securities portfolio may be less favorable to us than a more traditional heldforinvestment lending portfolio for example under the basel iii rule aftertax changes in the fair value of afs investment securities such as those which represent a majority of our investment portfolio are included in tier capital since loans held for investment are not subject to a fair value accounting framework changes in the fair value of loans other than expected credit losses are not similarly included in the determination of tier capital under the basel iii rule due to this differing treatment we may experience increased variability in our tier capital relative to other major financial institutions whose loanandlease portfolios represent a larger proportion of their consolidated total assets than ours additional risks associated with our investment portfolio include asset class concentration our investment portfolio continues to have significant concentrations in several classes of securities including agency residential mbs commercial mbs and other abs and securities with concentrated exposure to consumers these classes and types of securities experienced significant liquidity valuation and credit quality deterioration during the financial crisis that began in mid2007 we also hold nonus government securities nonus mbs and abs with exposures to european countries whose sovereigndebt markets have experienced increased stress at times since and may continue to experience stress in the future for further information refer to the risk factor titled our businesses have significant european operations and disruptions in european economies could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition further we hold a portfolio of us state and municipal bonds the value of which may be affected by the budget deficits that a number of states and municipalities currently face resulting in risks associated with this portfolio effects of market conditions if market conditions deteriorate our investment portfolio could experience a decline in market value whether due to a decline in liquidity or an increase in the yield required by investors to hold such securities regardless of our credit view of our portfolio holdings in addition in general deterioration in credit quality or changes in managements expectations regarding repayment timing or in managements investment intent to hold securities to maturity in each case with respect to our portfolio holdings could result in recognition of an allowance for expected credit losses or in impairment similarly if a material portion of our investment portfolio were to experience credit deterioration our state street corporation capital ratios as calculated pursuant to the basel iii rule could be adversely affected this risk is greater with portfolios of investment securities that contain credit risk than with holdings of us treasury securities effects of interest rates our investment portfolio is further subject to changes in both us and nonus primarily in europe interest rates and could be negatively affected by changes in those rates whether or not expected this is particularly true in the case of a quickerthananticipated increase in interest rates which would decrease market values in the nearterm or monetary policy that results in persistently low or negative rates of interest on certain investments the latter has been the case for example with respect to ecb monetary policy including negative interest rates in some jurisdictions with associated negative effects on our investment portfolio reinvestment nii and nim the effect on our nii has been exacerbated by the effects in recent fiscal years of the strong us dollar relative to other currencies particularly the euro if european interest rates remain low or decrease and the us dollar strengthens relative to the euro the negative effects on our nii likely will continue or increase the overall level of nii can also be impacted by the size of our deposit base as further increases in interest rates could lead to reduced deposit levels and also lower overall nii further a reduction in deposit levels could increase the requirements under the regulatory liquidity standards requiring us to invest a greater proportion of our investment portfolio holdings in hqla that have lower yields than other investable assets see also our business activities expose us to interest rate risk in this section our business activities expose us to interest rate risk in our business activities we assume interest rate risk by investing shortterm deposits received from our clients in our investment portfolio of longer and intermediateterm assets our nii and nim are affected by among other things the levels of interest rates in global markets changes in the relationship between short and longterm interest rates the direction and speed of interest rate changes and the asset and liability spreads relative to the currency and geographic mix of our interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities these factors are influenced among other things by a variety of economic and market forces and expectations including monetary policy and other activities of central banks such as the federal reserve and ecb that we do not control our ability to anticipate changes in these factors or to hedge the related on and offbalance sheet exposures and the cost of any such hedging activity can significantly influence the success of our assetandliability management activities and the resulting level of our nii and nim the impact of changes in interest rates and related factors will depend on the relative duration and fixed or floatingrate nature of our assets and liabilities sustained lower interest rates a flat or inverted yield curve and narrow credit spreads generally have a constraining effect on our nii in addition our ability to change deposit rates in response to changes in interest rates and other market and related factors is limited by client relationship considerations for additional information about the effects on interest rates on our business refer to the market risk management section assetandliability management activities in our managements discussion and analysis in this form 10k we assume significant credit risk to counterparties many of which are major financial institutions these financial institutions and other counterparties may also have substantial financial dependencies with other financial institutions and sovereign entities these credit exposures and concentrations could expose us to financial loss the financial markets are characterized by extensive interdependencies among numerous parties including banks central banks brokerdealers insurance companies and other financial institutions these financial institutions also include collective investment funds such as mutual funds ucits and hedge funds that share these interdependencies many financial institutions including collective investment funds also hold or are exposed to loans sovereign debt fixedincome securities derivatives counterparty and other forms of credit risk in amounts that are material to their financial condition as a result of our own business practices and these interdependencies we and many of our clients have concentrated counterparty exposure to other financial institutions and collective investment funds particularly large and complex institutions sovereign issuers mutual funds ucits and hedge funds although we have procedures for monitoring both individual and aggregate counterparty risk significant individual and aggregate counterparty exposure is inherent in our business as our focus is on servicing large institutional investors in the normal course of our business we assume concentrated credit risk at the individual obligor counterparty or group level such concentrations may be material and can often exceed of our consolidated total shareholders equity our material counterparty exposures change daily state street corporation and the counterparties or groups of related counterparties to which our risk exposure exceeds of our consolidated total shareholders equity are also variable during any reported period however our largest exposures tend to be to other financial institutions concentration of counterparty exposure presents significant risks to us and to our clients because the failure or perceived weakness of our counterparties or in some cases of our clients counterparties has the potential to expose us to risk of financial loss changes in market perception of the financial strength of particular financial institutions or sovereign issuers can occur rapidly are often based on a variety of factors and are difficult to predict this was observed during the financial crisis that began in when economic market political and other factors contributed to the perception of many financial institutions and sovereign issuers as being less credit worthy this led to credit downgrades of numerous large us and nonus financial institutions and several sovereign issuers which exposure stressed the perceived creditworthiness of financial institutions many of which invest in accept collateral in the form of or value other transactions based on the debt or other securities issued by sovereigns and substantially reduced value and liquidity in the market for their credit instruments these or other factors could again contribute to similar consequences or other market risks associated with reduced levels of liquidity as a result we may be exposed to increased counterparty risks either resulting from our role as principal or because of commitments we make in our capacity as agent for some of our clients additional areas where we experience exposure to credit risk include shortterm credit the degree of client demand for shortterm credit tends to increase during periods of market turbulence which may expose us to further counterpartyrelated risks for example investors in collective investment vehicles for which we act as custodian may experience significant redemption activity due to adverse market or economic news our relationship with our clients and the nature of the settlement process for some types of payments may result in the extension of shortterm credit in such circumstances we also provide committed lines of credit to support such activity for some types of clients we provide credit to allow them to leverage their portfolios which may expose us to potential loss if the client experiences investment losses or other credit difficulties industry and country risks in addition to our exposure to financial institutions we are from time to time exposed to concentrated credit risk at an industry or country level this concentration risk also applies to groups of unrelated counterparties that may have similar investment strategies involving one or more particular industries regions or other characteristics these unrelated counterparties may concurrently experience adverse effects to their performance liquidity or reputation due to events or other factors affecting such investment strategies though potentially not material individually relative to any one such counterparty our credit exposures to such a group of counterparties could expose us to a single market or political event or a correlated set of events that in the aggregate could have a material adverse impact on our business subcustodian risks our use of unaffiliated subcustodians exposes us to credit risk in addition to other risks such as operational risk dependencies on credit extensions and risks of the legal systems of the jurisdictions in which the subcustodians operate each of which may be material our operating model exposes us to risk of unaffiliated subcustodians to a degree greater than some of our competitors who have banking operations in more jurisdictions than we do our subcustodians operate in all jurisdictions in which our clients invest including emerging and other underdeveloped markets that entail heightened risks these risks are amplified due to evolving regulatory requirements with respect to our financial exposures in the event those subcustodians are unable to return clients assets including in some regulatory regimes such as the eus ucits v directive requirements that we be responsible for resulting losses suffered by our clients we may agree to similar or more stringent standards with clients that are not subject to such regulations our subcustodians are also large global financial institutions with whom we have other credit exposures this credit exposure to these financial institutions or subcustodians may limit the financial relationship we may have with these counterparties settlement risks we are exposed to settlement risks particularly in our payments and foreign exchange activities those activities may lead to extension of credit and consequent losses in the event of a state street corporation counterparty breach or an operational error including the failure to provide credit due to our membership in several industry clearing or settlement exchanges we may be required to guarantee obligations and liabilities or provide financial support in the event that other members do not honor their obligations or default moreover not all of our counterparty exposure is secured and even when our exposure is secured the realizable value of the collateral may have declined by the time we exercise our rights against that collateral this risk may be particularly acute if we are required to sell the collateral into an illiquid or temporarilyimpaired market or with respect to clients protected by sovereign immunity we are exposed to risk of shortterm credit or overdraft of our clients in connection with the process to facilitate settlement of trades and related foreign exchange activities particularly when contractual settlement has been agreed with our clients the occurrence of overdrafts at peak volatility could create significant credit exposure to our clients depending upon the value of such clients collateral at the time securities lending and repurchase agreement indemnification on behalf of clients enrolled in our securities lending program we lend securities to banks brokerdealers and other institutions in the event of a failure of the borrower to return such securities we typically agree to indemnify our clients for the amount by which the fair market value of those securities exceeds the proceeds of the disposition of the collateral posted by the borrower in connection with such transaction we also lend and borrow securities as riskless principal and in connection with those transactions receive a security interest in securities held by the borrowers in their securities portfolios and advance cash or securities as collateral to securities lenders borrowers are generally required to provide collateral equal to a contractually agreed percentage equal to or in excess of the fair market value of the loaned securities as the fair market value of the loaned securities or collateral changes additional collateral is provided by the borrower or collateral is returned to the borrower in addition our agency securities lending clients often purchase securities or other financial instruments from financial counterparties including brokerdealers under repurchase arrangements frequently as a method of reinvesting the cash collateral they receive from lending their securities under these arrangements the counterparty is obligated to repurchase these securities or financial instruments from the client at the same price plus an agreed rate of return at some point in the future the value of the collateral is intended to exceed the counterpartys payment obligation and collateral is adjusted daily to account for shortfall under or excess over the agreedupon collateralization level as with the securities lending program we agree to indemnify our clients from any loss that would arise on a default by the counterparty under these repurchase arrangements if the proceeds from the disposition of the securities or other financial assets held as collateral are less than the amount of the repayment obligation by the clients counterparty in such instances of counterparty default for both securities lending and repurchase agreements we rather than our client are exposed to the risks associated with collateral value repurchase and resale transactions we enter into repurchase and resale transactions in eligible securities with sponsored clients and with other ficc members and pursuant to ficc government securities division rules submit novate and net the transactions we may sponsor clients to clear their eligible repurchase transactions with ficc backed by our guarantee to ficc of the prompt and full payment and performance of our sponsored member clients respective obligations although we obtain a security interest from our sponsored clients in the collateral that they receive we are exposed to the associated risks including insufficiency of the value of collateral stable value arrangements we enter into stable value wrap derivative contracts with unaffiliated stable value funds that allow a stable value fund to provide book value coverage to its participants during the financial crisis the book value of obligations under many of these contracts exceeded the market value of the underlying portfolio holdings concerns regarding the portfolio of investments protected by such contracts or regarding the investment manager overseeing such an investment option may result in redemption demands from stable value products covered by benefitresponsive contracts at a time when the portfolios market value is less than its book value potentially exposing us to risk of loss state street corporation private equity subscription finance credit facilities we provide credit facilities to private equity funds the portfolio consists of capital call lines of credit the repayment of which is dependent on the receipt of capital calls from the underlying limited partner investors in the funds managed by these firms us municipal obligations remarketing credit facilities we provide credit facilities in connection with the remarketing of us municipal obligations potentially exposing us to credit exposure to the municipalities issuing such bonds and contingent liquidity risk leveraged loans in recent years we have increased our investment in leveraged loans both in the us and in europe we invest in these loans to noninvestment grade borrowers through participation in loan syndications in the noninvestment grade lending market we rate these loans as speculative under our internal riskrating framework and these loans have significant exposure to credit losses relative to higherrated loans we are therefore at a higher risk of default with respect to these investments relative to other of our investments activities in addition unlike other financial institutions that may have an active role in managing individual loan compliance our investment in these loans is generally as a passive investor with limited control as this portfolio grows and becomes more seasoned our allowance for credit losses related to these loans may increase through additional provisions for credit losses commercial real estate we finance commercial and multifamily properties which serve as collateral for our loans although collateralized these loans may become undersecured if the value of the collateral was overestimated or changes loan payments are dependent on the successful operation and management of the underlying collateral property to generate sufficient cash flow to repay the loan in a timely fashion a material decline in real estate markets or economic conditions could negatively impact value or property performance which could adversely impact timely loan repayment which may result in increased provision for credit losses on loans and actual losses either of which would have an adverse impact on our net income we seek to minimize these risks by maintaining lending policies and procedures and underwriting standards however there can be no assurance that these will protect us from creditrelated losses or delinquencies unavailability of netting we are generally not able to net exposures across counterparties that are affiliated entities and may not be able in all circumstances to net exposures to the same legal entity across multiple products as a consequence we may incur a loss in relation to one entity or product even though our exposure to an entitys affiliates or across product types is overcollateralized in some cases for example in our securities finance and foreign exchange activities we are able to enter into netting agreements that allow us to net offsetting exposures and payment obligations against one another in the event we become unable due to operational constraints actions by regulators changes in accounting principles law or regulation or related interpretations or other factors to net some or all of our offsetting exposures and payment obligations under those agreements we would be required to gross up our assets and liabilities on our statement of condition and our calculation of rwa accordingly this would result in a potentially material increase in our regulatory ratios including lcr and present increased credit liquidity assetandliability management and operational risks some of which could be material under currently prevailing regulatory restrictions on credit exposure we are required to limit our exposures to specific issuers or counterparties or groups of counterparties including financial institutions and sovereign issuers these credit exposure restrictions have and may further adversely affect certain of our businesses may require that we expand our credit exposure to a broader range of issuers and counterparties including issuers and counterparties that represent increased credit risk may reduce or foreclose our ability to enter into advantageous transactions or ventures with particular counterparties and may require that we modify our operating models or the policies and practices we use to manage our consolidated statement of condition the effects of these considerations may increase when evaluated under a stressed environment in stress testing including ccar in addition we are an adherent to the international swaps and derivatives association universal resolution stay protocol and as such are subject to restrictions against the exercise of rights and remedies against fellow adherents including other major financial institutions in the event they or an affiliate of theirs enters into resolution although our overall business is subject to these factors several of our activities are particularly state street corporation sensitive to them including our currency trading business and our securities finance business given the limited number of strong counterparties in the current market we are not able to mitigate all of our and our clients counterparty credit risk fee revenue represents a significant majority of our consolidated revenue and is subject to decline among other things in the event of a reduction in or changes to the level or type of investment activity by our clients we rely primarily on feebased services to derive our revenue this contrasts with commercial banks that may rely more heavily on interestbased sources of revenue such as loans during total fee revenue represented approximately of our total revenue fee revenue generated by our investment servicing and investment management businesses is augmented by foreign exchange trading services securities finance and software and processing fee revenue the level of these fees is influenced by several factors including the mix and volume of our auca and our aum the value and type of securities positions held with respect to assets under custody and the volume of our clients portfolio transactions and the types of products and services used by our clients in addition our clients include institutional investors such as mutual funds collective investment funds ucits hedge funds and other investment pools corporate and public retirement plans insurance companies foundations endowments and investment managers economic market or other factors that reduce the level or rates of savings in or with those institutions either through reductions in financial asset valuations or through changes in investor preferences could materially reduce our fee revenue and have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations if we are unable to effectively manage our capital and liquidity including by continuously attracting deposits and other shortterm funding our consolidated financial condition including our regulatory capital ratios our consolidated results of operations and our business prospects could be adversely affected liquidity management including on an intraday basis is critical to the management of our consolidated statement of condition and to our ability to service our client base we generally use our liquidity to meet clients demands for return of their deposits extend credit to our clients in connection with our investor services businesses and fund the pool of long and intermediateterm assets that are included in the investment securities and loan portfolio carried in our consolidated statement of condition because the demand for credit by our clients particularly settlement related extensions of credit is difficult to predict and control and may be at its peak at times of disruption in the securities markets and because the average maturity of our investment securities and loan portfolios is longer than the contractual maturity of our client deposit base we need to continuously attract and are dependent on access to various sources of shortterm funding since the financial crisis the level of client deposits held by us has tended to increase during times of market disruption however since such deposits are considered to be transitory we have historically deposited socalled excess deposits with us and nonus central banks and in other highly liquid but lowyielding instruments these levels of excess client deposits when they manifest have increased our nii but have adversely affected our nim in managing our liquidity our primary source of shortterm funding is client deposits which are predominantly transactionbased deposits by institutional investors our ability to continue to attract these deposits and other shortterm funding sources such as certificates of deposit is subject to variability based on a number of factors including volume and volatility in global financial markets the interest rates that we are prepared to pay for these deposits the loss or gain of one or more clients client interest in reducing noninterest bearing deposits the perception of safety of these deposits or shortterm obligations relative to alternative shortterm investments available to our clients including the capital markets and the classification of certain deposits for regulatory purposes and related discussions we may have from time to time with clients regarding better balancing our clients cash management needs with our economic and regulatory objectives the parent company is a nonoperating holding company and generally maintains only limited cash and other liquid resources at any time primarily to meet anticipated nearterm obligations to effectively manage our liquidity we routinely transfer assets among affiliated entities subsidiaries and branches internal or external factors such as regulatory requirements and standards including resolution planning and restrictions on dividend distributions influence our liquidity management and may limit our ability to effectively transfer liquidity internally which could among other things restrict our ability to fund operations dividends or stock repurchases or pay interest on debt securities or require us to seek state street corporation external and potentially more costly capital and impact our liquidity position in addition while not obligations of ours the investment products that we manage for third parties may be exposed to liquidity risks these products may be funded on a shortterm basis or the clients participating in these products may have a right to the return of cash or assets on limited notice these business activities include among others securities finance collateral pools money market and other shortterm investment funds and liquidity facilities utilized in connection with municipal bond programs if clients demand a return of their cash or assets particularly on limited notice and these investment pools do not have the liquidity to support those demands we could be forced to sell investment securities held by these asset pools at unfavorable prices damaging our reputation as a service provider and potentially exposing us to claims related to our management of the pools the availability and cost of credit in shortterm markets are highly dependent on the markets perception of our liquidity and creditworthiness our efforts to monitor and manage our liquidity risk including on an intraday basis may not be successful or sufficient to deal with dramatic or unanticipated changes in the global securities markets or other eventdriven reductions in liquidity as a result of such events among other things our cost of funds may increase thereby reducing our nii or we may need to dispose of a portion of our investment securities portfolio which depending on market conditions could result in a loss from such sales of investment securities being recorded in our consolidated statement of income we may need to raise additional capital or debt in the future which may not be available to us or may only be available on unfavorable terms we may need to raise additional capital or debt in order to maintain our credit ratings in response to regulatory changes including capital rules or for other purposes including financing acquisitions and joint ventures for example in november january and march we issued additional longterm debt in order to maintain levels to satisfy internal and regulatory requirements and in september and july we issued preferred stock and common stock respectively to finance our acquisition of crd however our ability to access the capital markets if needed on a timely basis or at all will depend on a number of factors such as the state of the financial markets and securities law requirements and standards in the event of rising interest rates disruptions in financial markets negative perceptions of our business or our financial strength or other factors that would increase our cost of borrowing we cannot be sure of our ability to raise additional capital or debt if needed on terms acceptable to us any diminished ability to raise additional capital or debt if needed could adversely affect our business and our ability to implement our business plan capital plan and strategic goals including the financing of acquisitions and joint ventures and our efforts to maintain regulatory compliance any downgrades in our credit ratings or an actual or perceived reduction in our financial strength could adversely affect our borrowing costs capital costs and liquidity position and cause reputational harm major independent rating agencies publish credit ratings for our debt obligations based on their evaluation of a number of factors some of which relate to our performance and other corporate developments including financings acquisitions and joint ventures and some of which relate to general industry conditions we anticipate that the rating agencies will continue to review our ratings regularly based on our consolidated results of operations and developments in our businesses including regulatory considerations such as resolution planning one or more of the major independent credit rating agencies have in the past downgraded and may in the future downgrade our credit ratings or have negatively revised their outlook for our credit ratings the current market and regulatory environment and our exposure to financial institutions and other counterparties including sovereign entities increase the risk that we may not maintain our current ratings and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to maintain our current credit ratings downgrades in our credit ratings may adversely affect our borrowing costs our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and in turn our liquidity a failure to maintain an acceptable credit rating may also preclude us from being competitive in various products additionally our counterparties as well as our clients rely on our financial strength and stability and evaluate the risks of doing business with us if we experience diminished financial strength or stability actual or perceived due to the effects of market or regulatory developments announced or rumored business developments consolidated results of operations a decline in our stock price or a downgrade to our credit rating our counterparties may be less willing to enter into transactions secured or unsecured with us our clients may reduce or place limits on the level of service we provide to them or seek to transfer the business in whole or in part to other service providers or our prospective clients may select other service providers any or all of these may have adverse effects on our business and reputation state street corporation the risk that we may be perceived as less creditworthy than other market participants is higher as a result of recent market developments which include an environment in which the consolidation and in some instances failure of financial institutions including major global financial institutions has resulted in a smaller number of much larger counterparties and competitors if our counterparties perceive us to be a less viable counterparty our ability to enter into financial transactions on terms acceptable to us or our clients on our or our clients behalf will be materially compromised if our clients reduce their deposits with us or select other service providers for all or a portion of the services we provide to them our revenues will decrease accordingly compliance and regulatory risks our business and capitalrelated activities including our ability to return capital to shareholders and repurchase our capital stock may be adversely affected by our implementation of regulatory capital and liquidity standards that we must meet or as a result of regulatory capital stress testing basel iii and doddfrank act we are required to calculate our riskbased capital ratios under both the basel iii advanced approaches and the basel iii standardized approach and we are subject to the more stringent of the riskbased capital ratios calculated under the advanced approaches and those calculated under the standardized approach in the assessment of our capital adequacy in implementing various aspects of these capital regulations we are making interpretations of the regulatory intent the federal reserve may determine that we are not in compliance with the capital rules and may require us to take actions to come into compliance that could adversely affect our business operations our regulatory capital structure our capital ratios or our financial performance or otherwise restrict our growth plans or strategies in addition banking regulators could change the basel iii rule or their interpretations as they apply to us including changes to these standards or interpretations made in regulations implementing provisions of the doddfrank act which could adversely affect us and our ability to comply with the basel iii rule along with the basel iii rule banking regulators also introduced additional requirements such as the slr lcr and the recently finalized nsfr each of which presents compliance risks for example the specification of the various elements of the nsfr in the final rule could have a material effect on our business activities including the management and composition of our investment securities portfolio and our ability to extend credit through committed facilities loans to our clients or our principal securities lending activities in addition further capital and liquidity requirements are being implemented or are under consideration by us and international banking regulators any of these rules or any additional regulatory initiatives introduced under the new administration could have a material effect on our capital and liquidity planning and related activities including the management and composition of our investment securities portfolio and our ability to extend committed contingent credit facilities to our clients the full effects of these rules and of other regulatory initiatives related to capital or liquidity on us and state street bank are subject to further regulatory guidance action or rulemaking systemic importance as a gsib we are generally subject to the most stringent provisions under the basel iii rule for example we are subject to the federal reserves rules on the implementation of capital surcharges for us gsibs and on tlac ltd and clean holding company requirements for us gsibs which we refer to as the tlac rule for additional information on these requirements refer to the regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity standards section under supervision and regulation in business in this form 10k not all of our competitors have similarly been designated as systemically important nor are all of them subject to the same degree of regulation as a bank or financial holding company and therefore some of our competitors are not subject to the same additional capital requirements comprehensive capital analysis and review we are required by the federal reserve to conduct periodic stress testing of our business operations and to develop an annual capital plan as part of the federal reserves ccar process the stress testing and ccar processes the severity and other characteristics of which may evolve from yeartoyear are used by the federal reserve to evaluate our management of capital and the adequacy of our regulatory capital and to determine the scb that we must maintain above our minimum regulatory capital requirements in order for us to make capital distributions and discretionary bonuses without limitation the results of the stress testing and ccar processes are difficult to predict due among other things to the federal reserves use of proprietary stress models that differ from our internal models the results of the federal reserves supervisory stress tests may result in an increase in our scb requirement the amounts of the planned capital actions in our capital plan in any year including stock repurchases and dividends may be substantially reduced from the amounts included in prior capital state street corporation plans these reductions may reflect changes in one or more different factors including our business prospects and related capital needs our capital position proposed acquisitions or other uses of capital the models used in our capital planning process the supervisory models used by the federal reserve to stress our balance sheet the federal reserves hypothetical economic scenarios for the ccar process the federal reserves ccar instructions and the federal reserves supervisory expectations for the capital planning process any of these potential events could require us as applicable to revise our stresstesting or capital management approaches resubmit our capital plan or postpone cancel or alter our planned capital actions in addition changes in our business strategy merger or acquisition activity or uses of capital could result in a change in our capital plan and its associated capital actions and may require us to resubmit our capital plan to the federal reserve and recalculate our scb requirement we are also subject to asset quality reviews and stress testing by the ecb and in the future we may be subject to similar reviews and testing by other regulators our implementation of capital and liquidity requirements including our capital plan may not be approved or may be objected to by the federal reserve and the federal reserve may impose capital requirements in excess of our expectations or require us to maintain levels of liquidity that are higher than we may expect and which may adversely affect our consolidated revenues in the event that our implementation of capital and liquidity requirements under regulatory initiatives or our current capital structure are determined not to conform with current and future capital requirements our ability to deploy capital in the operation of our business or our ability to distribute capital to shareholders or to repurchase our capital stock may be constrained and our business may be adversely affected in addition we may choose to forgo business opportunities due to their impact on our capital plan or stress tests including ccar and our scb requirement likewise in the event that regulators in other jurisdictions in which we have banking subsidiaries determine that our capital or liquidity levels do not conform with current and future regulatory requirements our ability to deploy capital our levels of liquidity or our business operations in those jurisdictions may be adversely affected for additional information about the above matters refer to regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity standards section under supervision and regulation in business and capital section under financial condition in our managements discussion and analysis in this form 10k we face extensive and changing government regulation in the us and in nonus jurisdictions in which we operate which may increase our costs and expose us to risks related to compliance most of our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by multiple regulatory bodies and many of the clients to which we provide services are themselves subject to a broad range of regulatory requirements these regulations may affect the scope of and the manner and terms of delivery of our services as a financial institution with substantial international operations we are subject to extensive regulation and supervisory oversight both inside and outside of the us this regulation and supervisory oversight affects among other things the scope of our activities and client services our capital and organizational structure our ability to fund the operations of our subsidiaries our lending practices our dividend policy our common stock purchase actions the manner in which we market our services our acquisition activities and our interactions with foreign regulatory agencies and officials in particular we are registered with the federal reserve as a bank holding company pursuant to the bank holding company act of the bank holding company act generally limits the activities in which we and our nonbanking subsidiaries may engage to managing or controlling banks and to activities considered to be closely related to banking as a bank holding company that has elected to be treated as a financial holding company under the bank holding company act we and some of our nonbanking subsidiaries may also engage in a broader range of activities considered to be financial in nature financial holding company status may be denied if we and our banking subsidiaries do not remain well capitalized and well managed or fail to comply with community reinvestment act obligations currently under the bank holding company act we may not be able to engage in new activities or acquire shares or control of other businesses we are unable to predict what if any changes to the regulatory environment may be enacted by congress both chambers of which are now under democratic control or the new presidential administration and what the impact of any such changes will be on our results of operations or financial condition including increased expenses or changes in the demand for our services or our ability to engage in transactions to expand our business or on the usdomestic or global economies or financial markets moreover the turnover of the presidential administration is expected to result in certain changes in the leadership and senior staffs of the federal banking agencies such changes are likely to impact the rulemaking supervision examination and enforcement priorities and policies of the agencies state street corporation the potential impact of any changes in agency personnel policies and priorities on the financial services sector including us cannot be predicted at this time we expect that our business will remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision several other aspects of the regulatory environment in which we operate and related risks are discussed below additional information is provided under supervision and regulation in business in this form 10k resolution planning we are required to periodically submit a plan for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure commonly referred to as a resolution plan or a living will to the federal reserve and the fdic under section 165d of the doddfrank act through resolution planning we seek in the event of insolvency to maintain state street banks role as a key infrastructure provider within the financial system while minimizing risk to the financial system and maximizing value for the benefit of our stakeholders significant management attention and resources are required in an effort to meet regulatory expectations with respect to resolution planning in the event of material financial distress or failure our preferred resolution strategy is the spoe strategy our resolution plan including our implementation of the spoe strategy with a secured support agreement involves important risks including that the spoe strategy and the obligations under the related secured support agreement may result in the recapitalization of andor provision of liquidity to state street bank and our other material entities and the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings by the parent company at an earlier stage of financial stress than might otherwise occur without such mechanisms in place an expected effect of the spoe strategy together with applicable tlac regulatory requirements is that our losses will be imposed on parent company shareholders and the holders of longterm debt and other forms of tlac securities currently outstanding or issued in the future by the parent company as well as on any other parent company creditors before any of our losses are imposed on the holders of the debt securities of state street bank or certain of the parent companys other operating subsidiaries or any of their depositors or creditors and before us taxpayers are put at risk there can be no assurance that there would be sufficient recapitalization resources available to ensure that state street bank and our other material entities are adequately capitalized following the triggering of the requirements to provide capital andor liquidity under the support agreement and there can be no assurance that credit rating agencies in response to our resolution plan or the support agreement will not downgrade place on negative watch or change their outlook on our debt credit ratings generally or on specific debt securities additional information about the spoe strategy including related risks is provided under recovery and resolution planning in business in this form 10k systemic importance our qualification in the us as a sifi and our designation by the financial stability board as a gsib to which certain regulatory capital surcharges may apply subjects us to incrementally higher capital and prudential requirements increased scrutiny of our activities and potential additional regulatory requirements or heightened regulatory expectations as compared to those applicable to some of the financial institutions with which we compete as a custodian or asset manager this qualification and designation also has significantly increased and may continue to increase our expenses associated with regulatory compliance including personnel and systems as well as implementation and related costs to enhance our programs global and nonus regulatory requirements the breadth of our business activities together with the scope of our global operations and varying business practices in relevant jurisdictions increase the complexity and costs of meeting our regulatory compliance obligations including in areas that are receiving significant regulatory scrutiny we are therefore subject to related risks of noncompliance including fines penalties lawsuits regulatory sanctions difficulties in obtaining governmental approvals limitations on our business activities or reputational harm any of which may be significant for example the global nature of our client base requires us to comply with complex laws and regulations of multiple jurisdictions relating to economic sanctions and money laundering in addition we are required to comply not only with the us foreign corrupt practices act but also with the applicable anticorruption laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate further our global operating model requires that we comply with information security resiliency and outsourcing oversight requirements including with respect to affiliated entities of multiple jurisdictions and enable our clients to comply with information security resiliency and outsourcing oversight requirements imposed upon them regulatory scrutiny of compliance with these and other laws and regulations is increasing and may in some respects impede the implementation of our global operating model that is central to both delivery of client service requirements and cost efficiency we sometimes face inconsistent laws and regulations across the various jurisdictions in which we operate the evolving regulatory landscape may interfere with our ability to conduct our operations with our pursuit of a common global operating model or with our ability to compete effectively with other financial state street corporation institutions operating in those jurisdictions or which may be subject to different regulatory requirements than apply to us in particular nonus regulations and initiatives that may be inconsistent or conflict with current or proposed regulations in the us could create increased compliance and other costs that would adversely affect our business operations or profitability geopolitical events such as the uks exit from the european union also have the potential to increase the complexity and cost of regulatory compliance in addition to us regulatory initiatives we are further affected by nonus regulatory initiatives including the implementation of the finalized basel prudential framework and the european commissions investment firm review and central securities depositories regulation as well as proposals for a review of the aifm directive and proposals under the capital markets union action plan recent proposed or potential regulations in the us and eu with respect to shortterm wholesale funding such as repurchase agreements or securities lending or other nonbank finance activities could also adversely affect not only our own operations but also the operations of the clients to which we provide services concerns regarding the liquidity and valuation of prime money market funds and similar products may adversely impact the cash management products we offer in addition anticompetitive voting power governance and other concerns with passive investment strategies continue to be the subject of legislative and regulatory debate which could significantly impact both our asset management business and the clients that we service consequences of regulatory environment and compliance risks domestic and international regulatory reform could limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities increase our regulatory capital requirements alter the risk profile of certain of our core activities and impose additional costs on us otherwise adversely affect our business our consolidated results of operations or financial condition and have other negative consequences including a reduction of our credit ratings different countries may respond to the market and economic environment in different and potentially conflicting manners which could increase the cost of compliance for us the evolving regulatory environment including changes to existing regulations and the introduction of new regulations may also contribute to decisions we may make to suspend reduce or withdraw from existing businesses activities markets or initiatives in addition to potential lost revenue associated with any such suspensions reductions or withdrawals any such suspensions reductions or withdrawals may result in significant restructuring or related costs or exposures if we do not comply with governmental regulations we may be subject to fines penalties lawsuits delays or difficulties in obtaining regulatory approvals or restrictions on our business activities or harm to our reputation which may significantly and adversely affect our business operations and in turn our consolidated results of operations the willingness of regulatory authorities to impose meaningful sanctions and the level of fines and penalties imposed in connection with regulatory violations have increased substantially since the financial crisis regulatory agencies may at times limit our ability to disclose their findings related actions or remedial measures similarly many of our clients are subject to significant regulatory requirements and retain our services in order for us to assist them in complying with those legal requirements changes in these regulations can significantly affect the services that we are asked to provide as well as our costs adverse publicity and damage to our reputation arising from the failure or perceived failure to comply with legal regulatory or contractual requirements could affect our ability to attract and retain clients if we cause clients to fail to comply with any regulatory requirements we may be liable to them for losses and expenses that they incur in recent years regulatory oversight and enforcement have increased substantially imposing additional costs and increasing the potential risks associated with our operations if this regulatory trend continues it could continue to adversely affect our operations and in turn our consolidated results of operations and financial condition for additional information see the risk factor our businesses may be adversely affected by government enforcement and litigation we are subject to enhanced external oversight as a result of certain agreements entered into in connection with the resolution of prior regulatory or governmental matters in connection with the resolution of certain proceedings relating to our having charged six clients of our transition management business during and amounts in excess of the contractual terms in january we entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the department of justice and the united states attorney for the doj under which we agreed to retain an independent compliance and ethics monitor for a term which has now been extended to subject to further extension to among other things review and monitor the effectiveness of our compliance controls and business ethics and make related recommendations and in september we entered into a settlement state street corporation agreement with the sec that also requires us to retain an independent ethics and compliance consultant we have retained a monitor who is fulfilling our obligations under both the deferred prosecution agreement and the sec settlement responding to the monitors requests entails significant cost and management attention and we are in general required to implement remediation plans to address any of the monitors recommendations these recommendations may require substantial cost and effort to remediate and even when consistent with our own control enhancement objectives may reflect differences in approach timing and cost than we may independently intend under the deferred prosecution agreement we also have a heightened obligation promptly to report issues involving potential or alleged fraudulent activities to the doj as a result of the enhanced inspections and monitoring activities to which we are subject under these agreements governmental authorities may identify areas in which we may need to take actions which may be significant to enhance our regulatory compliance or risk management practices such remedial actions may entail significant cost management attention and systems development and such efforts may affect our ability to expand our business until such remedial actions are completed these actions may be in addition to remedial measures required by the federal reserve and other financial regulators following examinations as a result of increased prudential expectations regarding our compliance programs culture and risk management our failure to implement enhanced compliance and risk management procedures in a manner and in a time frame deemed to be responsive by the applicable regulatory authority could adversely impact our relationship with such regulatory authority and could lead to restrictions on our activities or other sanctions moreover the identification of new or additional facts and circumstances suggesting inappropriate or noncompliant conduct whether identified by the monitor or a regulatory authority in the course of an inspection or independently by us could lead to new governmental proceedings or the reopening of matters that were previously resolved the presence of the monitor as well as governmental programs rewarding whistleblowing may also increase the instances of current or former employees alleging that certain practices are inconsistent with our legal or regulatory obligations our businesses may be adversely affected by government enforcement and litigation the businesses in which we operate are highlyregulated and subject to extensive external scrutiny that may be directed generally to participants in the businesses or markets in which we are involved or may be specifically directed at us including as a result of whistleblower and qui tam claims in the course of our business we are frequently subject to various regulatory governmental and law enforcement inquiries investigative demands and subpoenas and from time to time our clients or the government on its own behalf or on behalf of our clients or others make claims and take legal action relating to among other things our performance of our fiduciary contractual or regulatory responsibilities often the announcement of any such matters or of any settlement of a claim or action whether it involves us or others in our industry may spur the initiation of similar claims by other clients or governmental parties regulatory authorities have and are likely to continue to initiate cross industry reviews when a material issue is identified at a financial institution such inquiries involve costs and management time and may lead to proceedings relating to our own activities regardless of the outcome of any governmental enforcement or litigation matter responding to such matters is timeconsuming and expensive and can divert the attention of senior management governmental enforcement and litigation matters can involve claims for disgorgement demands for substantial monetary damages the imposition of civil or criminal penalties and the imposition of remedial sanctions or other required changes in our business practices any of which could result in increased expenses loss of client demand for our products or services or harm to our reputation the exposure associated with any proceedings that may be threatened commenced or filed against us could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for the period in which we establish a reserve with respect to such potential liability or upon our reputation in government settlements since the financial crisis the fines imposed by authorities have increased substantially and may exceed in some cases the profit earned or harm caused by the regulatory or other breach for example in connection with the resolution of the transition management matter we agreed to pay a fine of million approximately million to the uk fca in and fines of million to each of the doj and the sec in as a further example we paid an aggregate of million in to resolve a series of investigations and governmental and private claims alleging that our indirect foreign exchange rates prior to were not adequately disclosed or were otherwise improper these matters have also resulted in regulatory focus on the manner in which we charge clients and related disclosures this focus may lead to increased and prolonged governmental inquiries and client qui tam and whistleblower claims associated with the amount and disclosure of compensation we receive for our products and services state street corporation moreover us and certain international governmental authorities have increasingly brought criminal actions against financial institutions and criminal prosecutors have increasingly sought and obtained criminal guilty pleas deferred prosecution agreements or other criminal sanctions from financial institutions for example in we entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the us department of justice in connection with the resolution of the transition management matter and such agreement could increase the likelihood that governmental authorities will seek criminal sanctions against us in pending or future legal proceedings see the risk factor we are subject to various legal proceedings relating to the manner in which we have invoiced certain expenses and the outcome of such proceedings could materially adversely affect our results of operations or harm our business or reputation government authorities may also pursue criminal claims against current or former employees and these matters can among other things involve continuing reputational harm to us for example four of our former employees were indicted by us prosecutors on charges of criminal conspiracy in connection with their involvement in the transition management matter two of these individuals pled guilty and a third was convicted in in many cases we are required or may choose to report inappropriate or noncompliant conduct to the authorities and our failure or delay to do so may represent an independent regulatory violation or be treated as an indication of noncooperation with governmental authorities even when we promptly report a matter we may nonetheless experience regulatory fines liabilities to clients harm to our reputation or other adverse effects moreover our settlement or other resolution of any matter with any one or more regulators or other applicable party may not forestall other regulators or parties in the same or other jurisdictions from pursuing a claim or other action against us with respect to the same or a similar matter for more information about current contingencies relating to legal proceedings see note to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k the resolution of certain pending or potential legal or regulatory matters could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for the period in which the relevant matter is resolved or an accrual is determined to be required on our consolidated financial condition or on our reputation in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal and regulatory matters we cannot provide assurance as to the outcome of any pending or potential matter or if determined adversely against us the costs associated with any such matter particularly where the claimant seeks very large or indeterminate damages or where the matter presents novel legal theories involves a large number of parties involves the discretion of governmental authorities in seeking sanctions or negotiated resolution or is at a preliminary stage we may be unable to accurately estimate our exposure to the risks of legal and regulatory contingencies when we record reserves for probable and estimable loss contingencies as a result any reserves we establish may not be sufficient to cover our actual financial exposure similarly our estimates of the aggregate range of reasonably possible loss for legal and regulatory contingencies are based upon thenavailable information and are subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions and known and unknown uncertainties the matters underlying the estimated range will change from time to time and actual results may vary significantly from the estimate at any time we are subject to various legal proceedings relating to the manner in which we have invoiced certain expenses and the outcome of such proceedings could materially adversely affect our results of operations or harm our business or reputation in we determined we had incorrectly invoiced clients for certain expenses we have reimbursed most of our affected customers for those expenses and we have implemented enhancements to our billing processes in connection with our enhancements to our billing processes we continue to review historical billing practices and may from time to time identify additional remediation in we identified an additional area of incorrect expense billing associated with mailing services in our retirement services business we currently expect the cumulative total of our payments to customers for these invoicing errors including the error in the retirement services business to be at least million all of which has been paid or is accrued however we may identify additional remediation costs see the risk factor our efforts to improve our billing processes and practices are ongoing and may result in the identification of additional billing errors in march a purported class action was commenced against us alleging that our invoicing practices violated duties owed to retirement plan customers under erisa in addition we have received a purported class action demand letter alleging that our invoicing practices were unfair and deceptive under massachusetts law a class of customers or particular customers may assert that we have not paid to them all amounts incorrectly invoiced and may seek double or treble damages under massachusetts law we are also cooperating with investigations by governmental and regulatory authorities on these state street corporation matters including the civil and criminal divisions of the doj and the dol which reviews could result in significant fines or other sanctions civil and criminal against us in june we reached an agreement with the sec to settle its claims that we violated the recordkeeping provisions of section 34b of the investment company act of and caused violations of section 31a of the investment company act and rules 1a and 1b thereunder in connection with our overcharges of customers which are registered investment companies in reaching this settlement we neither admitted nor denied the claims contained in the secs order and agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of million also in june we reached an agreement with the massachusetts attorney generals office to resolve its claims related to this matter in reaching this settlement we neither admitted nor denied the claims in the order and agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of million the costs associated with these settlements were within our related previously established accruals for loss contingencies the sec and massachusetts attorney generals office settlements both recognize that the payment of million in disgorgement and interest is satisfied by our direct reimbursements of our customers in january the doj outlined a framework for a possible resolution of their review we are discussing the terms of a potential settlement of this matter with the doj separately we have inquired of the dol as to the status of their review but have not entered into settlement discussions with the dol there can be no assurance that any settlement with the doj or dol will be reached on financial or other terms acceptable to us or at all the aggregate amount of penalties that may potentially be imposed upon us in connection with the resolution of all outstanding investigations into our historical billing practices is not currently known we have established a legal accrual with respect to the pending governmental investigations and civil litigation with respect to this matter however our ultimate liability with respect to this matter might be significantly in excess of our current accrual government authorities have significant discretion in criminal and civil matters as to the fines and other penalties they may seek to impose any resolution of the doj and dol claims may involve penalties that could be a significant percentage or a multiple of all or a portion of the overcharge the severity of such fines or penalties could take into account factors such as the amount or duration of our incorrect invoicing and the governments or regulators assessment of the conduct of our employees as well as prior conduct such as that which resulted in our january deferred prosecution agreement and settlement of civil claims regarding our indirect fx business the outcome of any of these proceedings and in particular any criminal sanction could materially adversely affect our results of operations and could have significant additional consequences for our business and reputation our efforts to improve our billing processes and practices are ongoing and may result in the identification of additional billing errors in we determined we had incorrectly invoiced some of our investment servicing clients for certain expenses at that time we began the process of remediating these errors improving our billing processes and controls in the asset servicing business and other businesses and testing these improved billing processes and controls we are continuing to standardize enhance and where necessary replace and enhance controls and invest in new billing infrastructure the objective of this billing transformation program is to obtain greater billing accuracy and timeliness because of the scale of our business identifying and remediating all weaknesses and inefficiencies in our billing processes cannot be implemented concurrently accordingly the costs to remediate billing errors which may be discovered in that process would likely be incurred over a period that we are now unable accurately to determine as we work through this process we have discovered and may continue to discover areas where we believe our billing processes need improvement where we believe we have made billing errors with respect to particular customers and categories of fees and expenses and where we believe billing arrangements between ourselves and particular customers should be clarified such discoveries may lead to increased expense and decreased revenues the need to remediate prior billing errors government investigations or litigation that may materially impact our business financial results and reputation any theft loss damage to or other misappropriation or inadvertent disclosure of or inappropriate access to the confidential information we possess could have an adverse impact on our business and could subject us to regulatory actions litigation and other adverse effects our businesses and relationships with clients are dependent on our ability to maintain the confidentiality of our and our clients trade secrets and other confidential information including client transactional and holdings data and personal data about our clients our clients clients and our employees unauthorized access or failure of our controls with respect to granting access to our systems has in the past occurred and may in the future occur resulting in theft loss damage to or other misappropriation of such information in state street corporation addition our and our vendors personnel have in the past and may in the future inadvertently or deliberately disclose client or other confidential information any theft loss damage to other misappropriation or inadvertent disclosure of confidential information could have a material adverse impact on our competitive position our relationships with our clients and our reputation and could subject us to regulatory inquiries enforcement and fines civil litigation and possible financial liability or costs to the extent any of these events involve personal information the risks of enhanced regulatory scrutiny and the potential financial liabilities are exacerbated particularly under data protection regulations such as the gdpr our calculations of credit market and operational risk exposures total rwa and capital ratios for regulatory purposes depend on data inputs formulae models correlations and assumptions that are subject to change over time which changes in addition to our consolidated financial results could materially impact our risk exposures our total rwa and our capital ratios from period to period to calculate our credit market and operational risk exposures our total rwa and our capital ratios for regulatory purposes the basel iii rule involves the use of current and historical data including our own loss data and similar information from other industry participants market volatility measures interest rates and spreads asset valuations credit exposures and the creditworthiness of our counterparties these calculations also involve the use of quantitative formulae statistical models historical correlations and significant assumptions we refer to the data formulae models correlations and assumptions as well as our related internal processes as our advanced systems while our advanced systems are generally quantitative in nature significant components involve the exercise of judgment based on among other factors our and the financial services industrys evolving experience any of these judgments or other elements of our advanced systems may not individually or collectively precisely represent or calculate the scenarios circumstances outputs or other results for which they are designed or intended collectively they represent only our estimate of associated risk in addition our advanced systems are subject to update and periodic revalidation in response to changes in our business activities and our historical experiences forces and events experienced by the market broadly or by individual financial institutions changes in regulations and regulatory interpretations and other factors and are also subject to continuing regulatory review and approval for example a significant operational loss experienced by another financial institution even if we do not experience a related loss could result in a material change in the output of our advanced systems and a corresponding material change in our risk exposures our total rwa and our capital ratios compared to prior periods an operational loss that we experience could also result in a material change in our capital requirements for operational risk under the advanced approaches depending on the severity of the loss event its characterization among the seven baseldefined uom and the stability of the distributional approach for a particular uom this change in our capital requirements could be without direct correlation to the effects of the loss event or the timing of such effects on our results of operations due to the influence of changes in our advanced systems whether resulting from changes in data inputs regulation or regulatory supervision or interpretation specific to us or more general market or individual financial institutionspecific activities or experiences or other updates or factors we expect that our advanced systems and our credit market and operational risk exposures our total rwa and our capital ratios calculated under the basel iii rule will change and may be volatile over time and that those latter changes or volatility could be material as calculated and measured from period to period changes in accounting standards may adversely affect our consolidated financial statements new accounting standards or changes to existing accounting standards resulting both from initiatives of the fasb as well as changes in the interpretation of existing accounting standards potentially could affect our consolidated results of operations cash flows and financial condition these changes can materially affect how we record and report our consolidated results of operations cash flows financial condition and other financial information in some cases we could elect or be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in the revised treatment of certain transactions or activities and in some cases the revision of our consolidated financial statements for prior periods for additional information regarding changes in accounting standards refer to the recent accounting developments section of note to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k changes in tax laws rules or regulations challenges to our tax positions with respect to historical transactions and changes in the composition of our pretax earnings may increase our effective tax rate and thus adversely affect our consolidated financial statements our businesses can be directly or indirectly affected by new tax legislation the expiration of existing tax laws or the interpretation of existing tax laws worldwide the us federal and state governments including massachusetts and state street corporation jurisdictions around the world continue to review proposals to amend tax laws rules and regulations applicable to our businesses that could have a negative impact on our capital or aftertax earnings in the normal course of our business we are subject to review by us and nonus tax authorities a review by any such authority could result in an increase in our recorded tax liability in addition to the aforementioned risks our effective tax rate is dependent on the nature and geographic composition of our pretax earnings and could be negatively affected by changes in these factors the market transition away from broad use of the london interbank offered rate libor as an interest rate benchmark may impose additional costs on us and may expose us to increased operational model and financial risk globally regulators have advised large banks to assess the risks and to prepare for transition from libor to alternative rates ahead of year end our financial performance depends in part on our ability to adapt to market changes promptly while avoiding increased related expenses or operational errors substantial risks and uncertainties are associated with the market transition away from the use of libor as a critical interest rate benchmark used to determine amounts payable under and the value of financial instruments and contracts due to our dependencies on libor the failure or inability to timely plan and implement a libor transition program to maintain operational continuity and minimize economic impact for our clients ourselves and other stakeholders could negatively impact our business and financial performance those dependencies include liborbased securities and loans held in our investment portfolio liborbased preferred stock and longterm debt issued by us and liborbased client fee schedules and deposit pricing also our internal models which support decision making and risk management will require adjustments which may cause weaknesses in the underlying model inadequate assumptions or lead to reliance on poor or inaccurate data assets held by our customers in their investment portfolios or in the investment portfolios we manage for others have liborbased terms we need to enhance our processes and systems to account for the new alternative ratesbased instruments as they come to market the transition of liborbased instruments to their fallback language and uncertainty as to how such instruments should be valued where such fallback language is unclear these process and systems requirements could adversely impact our business which in some instances is dependent on critical inputs from third parties who themselves must timely adapt to the market changes and failure to implement the terms of those instruments in a manner consistent with customer expectation could lead to disputes and operational issues failure or perceived failure to adequately prepare for libor transition could affect our ability to attract and retain clients uncertainty relative to external developments necessary for the market transition away from libor but outside of our control could further increase the costs and risks of the transition for us or our subsidiaries and have an adverse impact on our operational and financial performance operational risks our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented our risk management policies and procedures may be inadequate and operational risks could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations we have in the past failed and may in the future fail to identify and manage risks related to a variety of aspects of our business including but not limited to cybersecurity information technology risk operational risk and resiliency interest rate risk foreign exchange risk trading risk fiduciary risk legal and compliance risk liquidity risk and credit risk we have adopted various controls procedures policies and systems to monitor and manage risk we cannot provide assurance that those controls procedures policies and systems are or will be adequate to identify and manage internal and external risks including risks related to service providers in our various businesses the risk of individuals either employees or contractors engaging in conduct harmful or misleading to clients or to us such as consciously circumventing established control mechanisms to exceed trading or investment management limitations committing fraud or improperly selling products or services to clients is particularly challenging to manage through a control framework in addition we are subject to increased resiliency risk requiring continuous reinvestment enhancement and improvement in and of our information technology and operational infrastructure controls and personnel which may not be effectively or timely deployed or integrated moreover the financial and reputational impact of control or conduct failures can be significant persistent or repeated issues with respect to controls information technology and operational resiliency or individual conduct have raised and may in the future raise concerns among regulators regarding our culture governance and control environment there can be no assurance that our efforts to address such risks will be effective while we seek to contractually limit our financial exposure to operational risk the degree of protection that we are able to achieve varies and our potential exposure may be greater than the revenue we anticipate that we will earn from servicing our clients state street corporation in addition our businesses and the markets in which we operate are continuously evolving we will need to make additional investments to develop the operational infrastructure and to enhance our compliance and risk management capabilities to support these businesses which may increase the operating expenses of such businesses moreover we may fail to identify or fully understand the implications of changes in our businesses or the financial markets and fail to adequately or timely enhance our risk framework to address those changes to the extent that our risk framework is ineffective either because it fails to keep pace with changes in the financial markets regulatory or industry requirements technology and cybersecurity developments our businesses our counterparties clients or service providers or for other reasons we could incur losses suffer reputational damage or find ourselves out of compliance with applicable regulatory or contractual mandates or expectations and subject to regulatory inquiry or action against us operational risk is inherent in all of our business activities as a leading provider of services to institutional investors we provide a broad array of services including research investment management trading services and investment servicing that expose us to operational risk in addition these services generate a broad array of complex and specialized servicing confidentiality and fiduciary requirements many of which involve the opportunity for human systems or process errors we face the risk that the control policies procedures and systems we have established to comply with our operational or security requirements will fail will be inadequate or will become outdated we also face the potential for loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes employee supervision or monitoring mechanisms serviceprovider processes or other systems or controls which could materially affect our future consolidated results of operations given the volume and magnitude of transactions we process on a daily basis operational losses represent a potentially significant financial risk for our business operational errors that result in us remitting funds to a failing or bankrupt entity may be irreversible and may subject us to losses we may also be subject to disruptions from external events that are wholly or partially beyond our control which could cause delays or disruptions to operational functions including information processing and financial market settlement functions in addition our clients vendors and counterparties could suffer from such events should these events affect us or the clients vendors or counterparties with which we conduct business our consolidated results of operations could be negatively affected when we record balance sheet accruals for probable and estimable loss contingencies related to operational losses we may be unable to accurately estimate our potential exposure and any accruals we establish to cover operational losses may not be sufficient to cover our actual financial exposure which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations cost shifting to nonus jurisdictions and outsourcing may expose us to increased operational risk and reputational harm and may not result in expected cost savings we manage expenses by migrating certain business processes and business support functions to lowercost geographic locations such as india poland and china and by outsourcing to vendors and joint ventures in various jurisdictions this effort exposes us to the risk that we may not maintain service quality control and effective management or business resiliency within these operations during and after transitions these migrations also involve risks that our outsourcing vendors or joint ventures may not comply with their servicing and other contractual obligations to us including with respect to indemnification and information security and to the risk that we may not satisfy applicable regulatory responsibilities regarding the management and oversight of outsourcing providers joint ventures and other third parties our geographic footprint also exposes us to the relevant macroeconomic political legal and similar risks generally involved in doing business in the jurisdictions in which we establish lowercost locations or joint ventures or in which our outsourcing vendors locate their operations particularly in locations where we have a concentration of our operational activities such as india poland and china the increased elements of risk that arise from certain operating processes being conducted in some jurisdictions could lead to an increase in reputational risk during periods of transition of operations greater operational risk and client concerns exist with respect to maintaining a high level of service delivery and business resiliency the extent and pace at which we are able to move functions to lowercost locations joint ventures and outsourcing providers may also be affected by political regulatory and client acceptance issues including with respect to data use storage and security such relocation or outsourcing of functions also entails costs such as technology real estate and restructuring expenses which may offset or exceed the expected financial benefits of the relocation or outsourcing in addition the financial benefits of lowercost locations and of outsourcings may diminish over time or could be offset in the event that the us or other jurisdictions impose tax trade barrier or other measures which seek to discourage the use of lower cost jurisdictions state street corporation any failures of or damage to attack on or unauthorized access to our information technology systems or facilities or disruptions to our continuous operations including the systems facilities or operations of third parties with which we do business such as resulting from cyberattacks could result in significant costs reputational damage and limits on our ability to conduct our business activities our businesses depend on information technology infrastructure both internal and external to among other things record and process a large volume of increasingly complex transactions and other data in many currencies on a daily basis across numerous and diverse markets and jurisdictions and to maintain that data securely in recent years several financial services firms have suffered successful cyberattacks launched both domestically and from abroad resulting in the disruption of services to clients loss or misappropriation of sensitive or private data and reputational harm we also have been subjected to cyberattacks and although we have not to our knowledge suffered a material breach or suspension of our systems it is possible that we could suffer such a breach or suspension in the future or that we may be unaware of a prior attack cyberthreats are sophisticated and continually evolving we may not implement effective systems and other measures to effectively identify detect prevent mitigate recover from or remediate the full diversity of cyberthreats or improve and adapt such systems and measures as such threats evolve and advance a cybersecurity incident or a failure to protect our technology infrastructure systems and information and our clients and others information against cybersecurity threats could result in the theft loss unauthorized access to disclosure misuse or alteration of information system failures or outages or loss of access to information the expectations of our clients and regulators with respect to the resiliency of our systems and the adequacy of our control environment with respect to such systems has and is expected to increase as the risk of cyberattacks which is presently elevated due to the current workfromhome environment and the consequences of those attacks become more pronounced we may not be successful in meeting those expectations or in our efforts to identify detect prevent mitigate and respond to such cyberincidents or for our systems to recover in a manner that does not disrupt our ability to provide services to our clients the failure to maintain an adequate technology infrastructure and applications with effective cybersecurity controls could impact operations adversely affect our financial results result in loss of business damage our reputation or impact our ability to comply with regulatory obligations leading to regulatory fines and sanctions we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify investigate or remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures arising from cybersecurity threats our computer communications data processing networks backup business continuity disaster recovery or other operating information or technology systems facilities and activities have suffered and in the future may suffer disruptions or otherwise fail to operate properly or become disabled overloaded or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control which can adversely affect our ability to process transactions provide services or maintain systems availability maintain information security compliance and internal controls or otherwise appropriately conduct our business activities for example in addition to cyberattacks there could be sudden increases in transaction or data volumes electrical or telecommunications outages natural disasters or employee or contractor error or malfeasance third parties may also attempt to place individuals within state street or fraudulently induce employees vendors clients or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our clients or other parties any such disruptions or failures may require us among other things to reconstruct lost data which may not be possible reimburse our clients costs associated with such disruption or failure result in loss of client business or damage our information technology infrastructure or systems or those of our clients or other parties while we have not in the past suffered material harm or other adverse effects from such disruptions or failures we may not successfully prevent respond to or recover from such disruptions or failures in the future and any such disruption or failure could adversely impact our ability to conduct our businesses damage our reputation and cause losses potentially materially the third parties with which we do business which facilitate our business activities to whom we outsource operations or other activities from whom we receive products or services or with whom we otherwise engage or interact including financial intermediaries and technology infrastructure and service providers are also susceptible to the foregoing risks including the third parties with which they are similarly interconnected or on which they otherwise rely and our or their business operations and activities have been and may in the future be adversely affected perhaps materially by failures terminations errors or malfeasance by or attacks or constraints on one or more financial technology infrastructure or government institutions or intermediaries with whom we or they are interconnected or conduct business state street corporation in particular we like other financial services firms will continue to face increasing cyberthreats including computer viruses malicious code distributed denial of service attacks phishing attacks ransomware hacker attacks limited availability of services unauthorized access information security breaches or employee or contractor error or malfeasance that could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of our our clients or other parties confidential personal proprietary or other information or otherwise disrupt compromise or damage our or our clients or other parties business assets operations and activities these and similar types of threats are occurring globally with greater frequency and intensity and we may not anticipate or implement effective preventative measures against or identify and detect one or more such threats particularly because the techniques used change frequently or may not be recognized until after they are launched our status as a global sifi likely increases the risk that we are targeted by such cybersecurity threats in addition some of our service offerings such as data warehousing may also increase the risk we are and the consequences of being so targeted we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify investigate or remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures arising from cybersecurity threats we therefore could experience significant related costs and legal and financial exposures including lost or constrained ability to provide our services or maintain systems availability to clients regulatory inquiries enforcements actions and fines litigation damage to our reputation or property and enhanced competition due to our dependence on technology and the important role it plays in our business operations we are attempting to improve and update our information technology infrastructure among other things as some of our systems are approaching the end of their useful life are redundant or do not share data without reconciliation to be more efficient meet increasing client and regulatory security resiliency and other expectations and support opportunities of growth and to enhance resiliency and maintain business continuity updating these systems involves material costs and often involves implementation integration and security risks including risks that we may not adequately anticipate the market or technological trends regulatory expectations or client needs or experience unexpected challenges that could cause financial reputational and operational harm failing to properly respond to and invest in changes and advancements in technology can limit our ability to attract and retain clients prevent us from offering similar products and services as those offered by our competitors impair our ability to maintain continuous operations inhibit our ability to meet regulatory requirements and subject us to regulatory inquires longterm contracts expose us to pricing and performance risk we frequently enter into longterm client servicing contracts in our investment servicing business these include outsourcing and other core services contracts and can involve information technology development these arrangements generally set forth our fee schedule for the term of the contract and absent a change in service requirements do not permit us to reprice the contract for changes in our costs or for market pricing the longterm contracts for these relationships require in some cases considerable upfront investment by us including technology and conversion costs and carry the risk that pricing for the products and services we provide might not prove adequate to generate expected operating margins over the term of the contracts the profitability of these contracts is largely a function of our ability to accurately calculate pricing for our services efficiently assume our contractual responsibilities in a timely manner control our costs and maintain the relationship with the client for an adequate period of time to recover our upfront investment our estimate of the profitability of these arrangements can be adversely affected by declines in or inaccurate projections of the assets under the clients management whether due to general declines in the securities markets or clientspecific issues in addition the profitability of these arrangements may be based on our ability to crosssell additional services to these clients and we may be unable to do so in addition such contracts may permit early termination or reduction in services in the event that certain service levels are not met which termination or service reduction may result in loss of upfront investment in onboarding the client performance risk exists in each contract given our dependence on successful conversion and implementation onto our own operating platforms of the service activities provided our failure to meet specified service levels or implementation timelines may also adversely affect our revenue from such arrangements or permit early termination of the contracts by the client if the demand for these types of services were to decline we could see our revenue decline our businesses may be negatively affected by adverse publicity or other reputational harm our relationship with many of our clients is predicated on our reputation as a fiduciary and a service provider that adheres to the highest standards of ethics service quality and regulatory compliance as well as a leading provider of the products and services we offer adverse publicity regulatory actions state street corporation or fines litigation operational failures loss of client opportunities or market share or the failure to meet client expectations or fiduciary or other obligations could materially and adversely affect our reputation our ability to attract and retain clients or key employees or our sources of funding for the same or other businesses for example over the past decade we have experienced adverse publicity with respect to our indirect foreign exchange trading and this adverse publicity has contributed to a shift of client volume to other foreign exchange execution methods similarly governmental actions and reputational issues in our transition management business in the uk have adversely affected our transition management revenue and with criminal convictions or guilty pleas of three of our former employees in and the deferred prosecution agreement we entered into with the doj in early and the related sec settlement these effects have the potential to continue the client invoicing matter we announced in late has had similar effects for additional information about these matters see the risk factor our businesses may be adversely affected by government enforcement and litigation preserving and enhancing our reputation also depends on maintaining systems procedures and controls that address known risks and regulatory requirements as well as our ability to timely identify understand and mitigate additional risks that arise due to changes in our businesses and the marketplaces in which we operate the regulatory environment and client expectations we may not be able to protect our intellectual property and we are subject to claims of thirdparty intellectual property rights our potential inability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology effectively may allow competitors to duplicate our technology and products and may adversely affect our ability to compete with them to the extent that we do not protect our intellectual property effectively through patents maintaining trade secrets or other means in all of the jurisdictions in which we operate or market our products and services other parties including former employees with knowledge of our intellectual property may seek to exploit our intellectual property for their own or others advantage in addition we may infringe on claims of thirdparty patents and we may face intellectual property challenges from other parties including clients or service providers with whom we may engage in the development or implementation of other products services or solutions or to whose information we may have access for limited permitted purposes but with whom we also compete the risk of such infringement is enhanced in the current competitive fintech environment particularly with respect to our development of new products and services containing significant technology elements and dependencies any of which could become the subject of an infringement claim we may not be successful in defending against any such challenges or in obtaining licenses to avoid or resolve any intellectual property disputes thirdparty intellectual rights valid or not may also impede our deployment of the full scope of our products and service capabilities in all jurisdictions in which we operate or market our products and services the quantitative models we use to manage our business may contain errors that result in inadequate risk assessments inaccurate valuations or poor business decisions and lapses in disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could occur any of which could result in material harm we use quantitative models to help manage many different aspects of our businesses as an input to our overall assessment of capital adequacy we use models to measure the amount of credit risk market risk operational risk interest rate risk and liquidity risk we face during the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we sometimes use models to measure the value of asset and liability positions for which reliable market prices are not available we also use models to support many different types of business decisions including trading activities hedging assetandliability management and whether to change business strategy weaknesses in the underlying model inadequate model assumptions normal model limitations inappropriate model use weaknesses in model implementation or poor data quality could result in unanticipated and adverse consequences including material loss and material noncompliance with regulatory requirements or expectations because of our widespread usage of models potential weaknesses in our mrm practices pose an ongoing risk to us we also may fail to accurately quantify the magnitude of the risks we face our measurement methodologies rely on many assumptions and historical analyses and correlations these assumptions may be incorrect and the historical correlations on which we rely may not continue to be relevant consequently the measurements that we make for regulatory purposes may not adequately capture or express the true risk profiles of our businesses moreover as businesses and markets evolve our measurements may not accurately reflect this evolution while our risk measures may indicate sufficient capitalization they may underestimate the level of capital necessary to conduct our businesses additionally our disclosure controls and procedures may not be effective in every circumstance and similarly it is possible we may state street corporation identify a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting any such lapses or deficiencies may materially and adversely affect our business and consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial condition restrict our ability to access the capital markets require us to expend significant resources to correct the lapses or deficiencies expose us to regulatory or legal proceedings subject us to fines penalties or judgments or harm our reputation our reputation and business prospects may be damaged if our clients incur substantial losses in investment pools that we sponsor or manage or are restricted in redeeming their interests in these investment pools we manage assets on behalf of clients in several forms including in collective investment pools money market funds securities finance collateral pools cash collateral and other cash products and shortterm investment funds our management of collective investment pools on behalf of clients exposes us to reputational risk and operational losses if our clients incur substantial investment losses in these pools receive redemptions as inkind distributions rather than in cash or experience significant underperformance relative to the market or our competitors products our reputation could be significantly harmed which harm could significantly and adversely affect the prospects of our associated business units because we often implement investment and operational decisions and actions over multiple investment pools to achieve scale we face the risk that losses even small losses may have a significant effect in the aggregate within our investment management business we manage investment pools such as mutual funds and collective investment funds that generally offer our clients the ability to withdraw their investments on short notice generally daily or monthly this feature requires that we manage those pools in a manner that takes into account both maximizing the longterm return on the investment pool and retaining sufficient liquidity to meet reasonably anticipated liquidity requirements of our clients the importance of maintaining liquidity varies by product type but it is a particularly important feature in money market funds and other products designed to maintain a constant net asset value of in the past we have imposed restrictions on cash redemptions from the agency lending collateral pools as the perunit market value of those funds assets had declined below the constant the funds employ to effect purchase and redemption transactions both the decline of the funds net asset value below and the imposition of restrictions on redemptions had a significant client reputational and regulatory impact on us and the recurrence of such or similar circumstances in the future could adversely impact our consolidated results of operations and financial condition we have also in the past continued to process purchase and redemption of units of investment products designed to maintain a constant net asset value at although the fair market value of the funds assets were less than if in the future we were to continue to process purchases and redemptions from such products at when the fair market value of our collateral pools assets is less than we could be exposed to significant liability if higher than normal demands for liquidity from our clients were to occur managing the liquidity requirements of our collective investment pools could become more difficult if such liquidity problems were to recur our relationships with our clients may be adversely affected and we could in certain circumstances be required to consolidate the investment pools into our consolidated statement of condition levels of redemption activity could increase and our consolidated results of operations and business prospects could be adversely affected in addition if a money market fund that we manage were to have unexpected liquidity demands from investors in the fund that exceeded available liquidity the fund could be required to sell assets to meet those redemption requirements and selling the assets held by the fund at a reasonable price if at all may then be difficult because of the size of the investment pools that we manage we may not have the financial ability or regulatory authority to support the liquidity or other demands of our clients any decision by us to provide financial support to an investment pool to support our reputation in circumstances where we are not statutorily or contractually obligated to do so could result in the recognition of significant losses could adversely affect the regulatory view of our capital levels or plans and could in some cases require us to consolidate the investment pools into our consolidated statement of condition any failure of the pools to meet redemption requests or under performance of our pools relative to similar products offered by our competitors could harm our business and our reputation we may incur losses arising from our investments in sponsored investment funds which could be material to our consolidated results of operations in the periods incurred in the normal course of business we manage various types of sponsored investment funds through state street global advisors the services we provide to these sponsored investment funds generate management fee revenue as well as servicing fees from our other businesses from time to time we may invest in the funds which we refer to as seed state street corporation capital in order for the funds to establish a performance history for newly launched strategies these funds may meet the definition of variable interest entities as defined by us gaap and if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of these funds we may be required to consolidate these funds in our consolidated financial statements under us gaap the funds follow specialized investment company accounting rules which prescribe fair value for the underlying investment securities held by the funds in the aggregate we expect any financial losses that we realize over time from these seed investments to be limited to the actual amount invested in the consolidated fund however in the event of a fund winddown gross gains and losses of the fund may be recognized for financial accounting purposes in different periods during the time the fund is consolidated but not wholly owned although we expect the actual economic loss to be limited to the amount invested our losses in any period for financial accounting purposes could exceed the value of our economic interests in the fund and could exceed the value of our initial seed capital investment in instances where we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the sponsored investment fund we do not include the funds in our consolidated financial statements our risk of loss associated with investment in these unconsolidated funds primarily represents our seed capital investment which could become realized as a result of poor investment performance however the amount of loss we may recognize during any period would be limited to the carrying amount of our investment climate change may increase the frequency and severity of major weather events and could adversely
