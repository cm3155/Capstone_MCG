nor impacted by market fluctuations or values changes in market valuations our servicing fee revenue is impacted by both our levels and the geographic and product mix of our auca increases or decreases in market valuations have a corresponding impact on the level of our auca and servicing fee revenues though the degree of impact will vary depending on asset types and classes and geography

through november for emea copyright broadridge financial solutions inc pricing the industry in which we operate has historically faced pricing pressure and our servicing fee revenues are also affected by such pressures today consequently no assumption should be drawn as to future revenue run rate from announced servicing wins as the amount of revenue associated with auca can vary materially on average over the five years ended december we estimate that pricing pressure with respect to existing clients has impacted our servicing fees by approximately annually with the impact ranging from to in any given year and approximately in both and pricing concessions can be a part of a contract renegotiation with a client including terms that may benefit us such as extending the terms of our relationship with the client expanding the scope of services that we provide or reducing our dependency on manual processes through the standardization of the services we provide the timing of the impact of additional revenue generated by anticipated additional services and the amount of revenue generated may differ from the impact of pricing concessions on existing services due to the necessary time required to onboard those new services the nature of those services and client investment practices these same market pressures also impact the fees we negotiate when we win business from new clients net new business over the five years ended december net new business which includes business both won and lost has affected our servicing fee revenues by approximately on average with a range of to annually and approximately and in and respectively inclusive of a client transition new business impacting servicing fees can include custody product and participant level accounting daily valuation and administration recordkeeping cash management and other services revenues associated with new servicing mandates may vary based on the breadth of services provided the time required to install the assets and the types of assets installed management fee revenue management fees generally are affected by our level of aum which we report based on monthend valuations management fees for certain components of managed assets such as etfs mutual funds and ucits are affected by daily average valuations of aum management fee revenue is more sensitive to market valuations than servicing fee revenue as a higher proportion of the underlying services provided and the associated management fees earned are dependent on equity and fixedincome security valuations additional factors such as the relative mix of assets managed may have a significant effect on our state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management fee revenue while certain management fees are directly determined by the values of aum and the investment strategies employed management fees may reflect other factors including performance fee arrangements as well as our relationship pricing for clients assetbased management fees for passively managed products to which our aum is currently primarily weighted are generally charged at a lower fee of aum than for actively managed products actively managed products may also include performance fee arrangements which are recorded when the fee is earned based on predetermined benchmarks associated with the applicable accounts performance in light of the above we estimate using relevant information as of december and assuming that all other factors remain constant including the impact of business won and lost and client flows that table start a increase or decrease in worldwide equity valuations on a weighted average basis over the relevant periods for which our management fees are

revenue that is exempt from income taxes mainly earned from certain investment securities state and political subdivisions is adjusted to a fte basis using the us federal and state statutory income

driven by lower average total client deposits interestbearing deposits with banks averaged billion in compared to billion in these deposits primarily reflect our maintenance of cash balances at the

credit risk as the risk of financial loss if a counterparty borrower or obligor collectively referred to as a counterparty is either unable or unwilling to repay borrowings or settle a transaction in accordance with underlying contractual terms we assume credit risk in our traditional nontrading lending activities such as loans and contingent commitments in our investment securities portfolio where recourse to a counterparty exists and in our direct and indirect trading activities such as principal securities lending and foreign exchange and indemnified agency securities lending we also assume credit risk in our daytoday treasury and securities and other settlement operations in the form of deposit placements and other cash balances with central banks or private sector institutions we distinguish between three major types of credit risk table start default risk the risk that a counterparty fails to meet its contractual payment obligations table endtable start country risk the risk that we may suffer a loss in any given country due to any of the following reasons deterioration of economic conditions political and social upheaval nationalization and appropriation of assets government repudiation of indebtedness exchange controls and disruptive currency depreciation or devaluation and table endtable start settlement risk the risk that the settlement or clearance of transactions will fail which arises whenever the exchange of cash securities andor other assets is not simultaneous table end the acceptance of credit risk by us is governed by corporate policies and guidelines which include standardized procedures applied across the entire organization these policies and guidelines include specific requirements related to each counterpartys risk profile the

review all extensions of credit and the creditworthiness of counterparties at least annually the nature and extent of these reviews are determined by the size nature and term of the extensions of credit and the creditworthiness of the counterparty and table endtable start we subject all corporate policies and guidelines to annual review as an integral part of our periodic assessment of our risk appetite table end our corporate policies and guidelines require that the business units which engage in activities that give rise to credit and counterparty risk comply with procedures that promote the extension of credit for legitimate business purposes are consistent with the maintenance of proper credit standards limit creditrelated losses and are consistent with our goal of maintaining a strong financial condition structure and organization the credit and global markets risk group within erm is responsible for the assessment approval and monitoring of credit risk across our business the group is managed centrally has dedicated teams in a number of locations worldwide across our businesses and is responsible for related policies and procedures and for our internal creditrating systems and methodologies in addition the group in conjunction with the business units establishes measurements and limits to control the amount of credit risk accepted across its various business activities both at the portfolio level and for each individual counterparty or group of counterparties to individual industries and also to counterparties by product and country of risk these measurements and limits are reviewed periodically but at least annually in conjunction with other groups in erm the credit and global markets risk group is jointly responsible for the design implementation and oversight of our credit risk measurement and management systems including data and assessment systems quantification systems and the reporting framework various key committees are responsible for the oversight of credit risk and associated credit risk policies systems and models all creditrelated activities are governed by our risk appetite framework and our credit risk

committee a subcommittee of the crpc has responsibility for assigning credit authority and approving the largest and higherrisk extensions of credit to individual counterparties or groups of counterparties crpc provides periodic updates to mrac and the boards rc credit ratings we perform initial and ongoing reviews to exercise due diligence on the creditworthiness of our counterparties when conducting any business with them or approving any credit limits this due diligence process generally includes the assignment of an internal credit rating which is determined by the use of internally developed and validated methodologies scorecards and a 15grade rating scale this riskrating process incorporates the use of riskrating tools in conjunction with management judgment qualitative and quantitative inputs are captured in a replicable manner and following a formal review and approval process an internal credit rating based on our rating scale is assigned credit ratings are reviewed and approved by the credit and global markets risk group or designees within erm to facilitate comparability across the portfolio counterparties within a given sector are rated using a riskrating tool developed for that sector our riskrating methodologies are approved by the crpc after completion of internal model validation processes and are subject to an annual review including revalidation we generally rate our counterparties individually although accounts defined by us as lowrisk are rated on a pooled basis we evaluate and rate the credit risk of our counterparties on an ongoing basis risk parameter estimates our internal riskrating system seeks to promote a clear and consistent approach to the determination of appropriate credit risk classifications for our credit counterparties and exposures tracking the changes in risk associated with these counterparties and exposures over time this capability enhances our ability to more accurately calculate both risk exposures and capital enabling better strategic decision making across the organization state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we use credit risk parameter estimates for the following purposes table start the assessment of the creditworthiness of new counterparties and in conjunction with our risk appetite statement the development of appropriate credit limits for our products and services including loans foreign exchange securities finance placements and repurchase agreements table endtable start the use of an automated process for limit approvals for certain lowrisk counterparties as defined in our credit risk guidelines based on the counterpartys probabilityofdefault or pd

endtable start the aggregation and comparison of counterparty exposures with risk appetite levels to determine if businesses are maintaining appropriate risk levels and table endtable start the determination of our regulatory capital requirements for the airb provided in the basel framework table end credit risk mitigation we seek to limit our credit exposure and reduce our potential credit losses through various types of risk mitigation in our daytoday management of credit risks we utilize and recognize the following types of risk mitigation collateral in many parts of our business we regularly require or agree for collateral to be received from or provided to clients and counterparties in connection with contracts that incur credit risk in our trading businesses this collateral is typically in the form of cash and highlyrated securities government securities and other bonds or equity securities credit risks in our nontrading and securities finance businesses are also often secured by bonds and equity securities and by other types of assets collateral serves to reduce the risk of loss inherent in an exposure by improving the prospect of recovery in the event of a counterparty default however rapidly changing market values of the collateral we hold unexpected increases in the credit exposure to a client or counterparty reductions in the value or change in the type of securities held by us as well as operational errors or errors in the manner in which we seek to exercise our rights may reduce the risk mitigation effects of collateral or result in other security interests not being effective to reduce potential credit exposure while collateral is often an alternative source of repayment it generally does not replace the requirement within our policies and guidelines for highquality underwriting standards we also may choose to incur credit exposure without the benefit of collateral or other risk mitigating credits rights our credit risk guidelines require that the collateral we accept for risk mitigation purposes is of high quality can be reliably valued and can be liquidated if or when required generally when collateral is of lower quality more difficult to value or more challenging to liquidate higher discounts to market values are applied for the purposes of measuring credit risk for certain less liquid collateral longer liquidation periods are assumed when determining the credit exposure all types of collateral are assessed regularly by erm as is the basis on which the collateral is valued our assessment of collateral including the ability to liquidate collateral in the event of a counterparty default and also with regard to market values of collateral under a variety of hypothetical market conditions is an integral component of our assessment of risk and approval of credit limits we also seek to identify limit and monitor instances of wrongway risk where a counterpartys risk of default is positively correlated with the risk of our collateral eroding in value we maintain policies and procedures requiring that documentation used to collateralize a transaction is legal valid binding and enforceable in the relevant jurisdictions we also conduct legal reviews to assess whether our documentation meets these standards on an ongoing basis netting netting is a mechanism that allows institutions and counterparties to net offsetting exposures and payment obligations against one another through the use of qualifying master netting agreements a master netting agreement allows the netting of rights and obligations arising under derivative or other transactions that have state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations been entered into under such an agreement upon the counterpartys default resulting in a single net claim owed by or to the counterparty this is commonly referred to as closeout netting and is pursued wherever possible we may also enter into master agreements that allow for the netting of amounts payable on a given day and in the same currency reducing our settlement risk this is commonly referred to as payment netting and is widely used in our foreign exchange activities as with collateral we have policies and procedures in place to apply closeout and payment netting only to the extent that we have verified legal validity and enforceability of the master agreement in the case of payment netting operational constraints may preclude us from reducing settlement risk notwithstanding the legal right to require the same under the master netting agreement in the event we become unable due to operational constraints actions by regulators changes in accounting principles law or regulation or related interpretations or other factors to net some or all of our offsetting exposures and payment obligations under those agreements we would be required to gross up our assets and liabilities on our statement of condition and our calculation of rwa accordingly this would result in a potentially material increase in our regulatory ratios including lcr and present increased credit liquidity assetandliability management and operational risks some of which could be material guarantees a guarantee is a financial instrument that results in credit support being provided by a third party ie the protection provider to the underlying obligor the beneficiary of the provided protection on account of an exposure owing by the obligor the protection provider may support the underlying exposure either in whole or in part support of this kind may take different forms typical forms of guarantees provided to us include financial guarantees letters of credit bankers acceptances purchase undertaking agreements contracts and insurance we have established a review process to evaluate guarantees under the applicable requirements of our policies and basel iii requirements governance for this evaluation is covered under policies and procedures that require regular reviews of documentation jurisdictions and credit quality of protection providers pursuant to the basel iii rule we are permitted to reflect the application of credit risk mitigation which may include for example guarantees collateral netting secured interests in nonfinancial assets and credit default swaps we do not actively use credit default swaps as a risk mitigation tool although it increasingly applies the recognition of guarantees collateral and security over nonfinancial assets to mitigate overall risk within its counterparty credit portfolio credit limits central to our philosophy for our management of credit risk is the approval and imposition of credit limits against which we monitor the actual and potential future credit exposure arising from our business activities with counterparties or groups of counterparties credit limits are a reflection of our risk appetite which may be determined by the creditworthiness of the counterparty the nature of the risk inherent in the business undertaken with the counterparty or a combination of relevant credit factors our risk appetite for certain sectors and certain countries and geographic regions may also influence the level of risk we are willing to assume to certain counterparties the analysis and approval of credit limits is undertaken in a consistent manner across our businesses although the nature and extent of the analysis may vary based on the type term and magnitude of the risk being assumed credit limits and underlying exposures are assessed and measured on both a gross and net basis where appropriate with net exposure determined by deducting the value of any collateral held for certain types of risk being assumed we will also assess and measure exposures under a variety of hypothetical market conditions credit limit approvals across our business are undertaken by the credit and global markets risk group by individuals to whom credit authority has been delegated or by the credit committee credit limits are reevaluated annually or more frequently as needed and are revised periodically on prevailing and anticipated market conditions changes in counterparty or countryspecific credit ratings and outlook changes in our risk appetite for certain counterparties sectors or countries and enhancements to the measurement of credit utilization reporting ongoing active monitoring and management of our credit risk is an integral part of our credit risk management framework we maintain management information systems to identify measure monitor and report credit risk across businesses and legal entities enabling erm and our businesses to have timely access to accurate information on credit limits and exposures monitoring is performed along the dimensions of counterparty industry country and productspecific risks to facilitate the identification of concentrations of risk and emerging trends key aspects of this credit risk reporting structure include governance and oversight groups policies that define standards for the reporting of credit risk data aggregation and sourcing systems and separate testing of relevant risk reporting functions by corporate audit state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the credit portfolio management group routinely assesses the composition of our overall credit risk portfolio for alignment with our stated risk appetite this assessment includes routine analysis and reporting of the portfolio monitoring of marketbased indicators the assessment of industry trends and developments and regular reviews of concentrated risks the credit portfolio management group is also responsible in conjunction with the business units for defining the appetite for credit risk in the major sectors in which we have a concentration of business activities these sectorlevel risk appetite statements which include counterparty selection criteria and granular underwriting guidelines are reviewed periodically and approved by the crpc monitoring regular surveillance of credit and counterparty risks is undertaken by our business units the credit and global markets risk group and designees with erm allowing for frequent and extensive oversight this surveillance process includes but is not limited to the following components table start annual reviews a formal review of counterparties is conducted at least annually and includes a thorough review of operating performance primary risk factors and our internal credit risk rating this annual review also includes a review of current and proposed credit limits an assessment of our ongoing risk appetite and verification that supporting legal documentation remains effective table endtable start interim monitoring periodic monitoring of our largest and riskiest counterparties is undertaken more frequently utilizing financial information market indicators and other relevant credit and performance measures the nature and extent of this interim monitoring is individually tailored to certain counterparties andor industry sectors to identify material changes to the risk profile of a counterparty or group of counterparties and assign an updated internal risk rating in a timely manner table end we maintain an active watch list for all counterparties where we have identified a concern that the actual or potential risk of default has increased the watch list status denotes a concern with some aspect of a counterpartys risk profile that warrants closer monitoring of the counterpartys financial performance and related risk factors our ongoing monitoring processes are designed to facilitate the early identification of counterparties whose creditworthiness is deteriorating any counterparty may be placed on the watch list by erm at its sole discretion counterparties that receive an internal risk rating within a certain range on our rating scale are eligible for watch list designation these risk ratings generally correspond with the noninvestment grade or near noninvestment grade ratings established by the major independent creditrating agencies and also include the regulatory classifications of special mention substandard doubtful and loss counterparties whose internal ratings are outside this range may also be placed on the watch list the credit and global markets risk group maintains primary responsibility for our watch list processes and generates a monthly report of all watch list counterparties the watch list is formally reviewed at least on a quarterly basis with participation from senior erm staff and representatives from the business units and our corporate finance and legal groups as appropriate these meetings include a review of individual watch list counterparties together with credit limits and prevailing exposures and are focused on actions to contain reduce or eliminate the risk of loss to us identified actions are documented and monitored controls gcr provides a separate level of surveillance and oversight over the integrity of our credit risk management processes including the internal riskrating system gcr reviews counterparty credit ratings for all identified sectors on an ongoing basis gcr is subject to oversight by the crpc and provides periodic

of credit to support our offbalance credit exposure the two components together represent the reserve for credit losses review and evaluation of the adequacy of the reserve for credit losses is ongoing throughout the year but occurs at least quarterly and is based among other factors on our evaluation of the level of risk in the portfolio the volume of adversely classified loans previous loss experience current trends and economic conditions and their effect on our counterparties additional information about the allowance for loan losses is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k liquidity risk management our liquidity framework contemplates areas of potential risk based on our activities size and other appropriate riskrelated factors in managing liquidity risk we employ limits maintain established metrics and early warning indicators and perform routine stress testing to identify potential liquidity needs this process involves the evaluation of a combination of internal and external scenarios which assist us in measuring our liquidity position and in identifying potential increases in cash needs or decreases in available sources of cash as well as the potential impairment of our ability to access the global capital markets we manage our liquidity on a global consolidated basis we also manage liquidity on a standalone basis at our parent company as well as at certain branches and subsidiaries of state street bank state street bank generally has access to markets and funding sources limited to banks such as the federal funds market and the federal reserves discount window the parent company is managed to a more conservative liquidity profile reflecting narrower market access additionally the parent company typically holds or has direct access to primarily through ssif a direct subsidiary of the parent company as discussed in supervision and regulation in business in this form 10k enough cash to meet its current debt maturities and cash needs as well as those projected over the next oneyear period absent financial distress at the parent company the liquid assets available at ssif continue to be

through ssif as of december our parent company and state street bank had approximately billion of senior notes or subordinated debentures outstanding that will mature in the next twelve months as a sifi our liquidity risk management activities are subject to heightened and evolving regulatory requirements including interpretations of those requirements under specific us and international

potential impairment of our ability to access the global capital markets we manage liquidity according to several principles that are equally important to our overall liquidity risk management framework table start structural liquidity management addresses liquidity by monitoring and directing the composition of our consolidated statement of condition structural liquidity is measured by metrics such as the percentage of total wholesale funds to consolidated total assets and the percentage of nongovernment investment securities to client deposits in addition on a regular basis and as described below our structural liquidity is evaluated under various stress scenarios table endtable start tactical liquidity management addresses our daytoday funding requirements and is largely driven by changes in our primary source of funding which are client deposits fluctuations in client deposits may be supplemented with shortterm borrowings repurchase agreements fhlb products and certificates of deposit table endtable start stress testing and contingent funding planning are longerterm strategic liquidity risk management practices regular and ad hoc liquidity stress testing are performed under various severe but plausible scenarios at the consolidated level and at significant subsidiaries including state street bank these tests contemplate severe market and events specific to us under various time horizons and severities tests contemplate the impact of material changes in key funding sources credit ratings additional collateral requirements contingent uses of funding systemic shocks to the financial markets and operational failures based on market and assumptions specific to us the stress tests evaluate the required level of funding versus available sources in an adverse environment as stress testing contemplates potential forwardlooking scenarios results also serve table end as a trigger to activate specific liquidity stress levels and contingent funding actions cfp s are designed to assist senior management with decisionmaking associated with any contingency funding response to a possible or actual crisis scenario the cfps define roles responsibilities and management actions to be taken in the event of deterioration of our liquidity profile caused by either an event specific to us or a broader disruption in the capital markets specific actions are linked to the level of stress indicated by these measures or by management judgment of market conditions liquidity risk metrics in managing our liquidity we employ early warning indicators and metrics early warning indicators are intended to detect situations which may result in a liquidity stress including changes in our common stock price and the spread on our longterm debt additional metrics that are critical to the management of our consolidated statement of condition and monitored as part of our routine liquidity management include measures of our fungible cash position purchased wholesale funds unencumbered liquid assets deposits and the total of investment securities and loans as a percentage of total client deposits asset liquidity central to the management of our liquidity is asset liquidity which consists primarily of hqla hqla is the amount of liquid assets that qualify for inclusion in the lcr as a banking organization we are subject to a minimum lcr under the lcr rule approved by us banking regulators the lcr is intended to promote the shortterm resilience of internationally active banking organizations like us to improve the banking industrys ability to absorb shocks arising from market stress over a calendar day period and improve the measurement and management of liquidity risk the lcr measures an institutions hqla against its net cash outflows hqla primarily consists of unencumbered cash and certain high quality liquid securities that qualify for inclusion under the lcr rule the lcr was fully implemented beginning on january we report lcr to the federal reserve daily for the quarters ended december and december daily average lcr for the parent company was and respectively the average hqla for the parent company under the lcr final rule definition was billion and billion postprescribed haircuts for the quarters ended december and december respectively the increase in average hqla for the quarter ended december compared to the quarter ended december was primarily a result of an increase in hqla purchases as part of the repositioning of the investment portfolio state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we maintained average cash balances in excess of regulatory requirements governing deposits with the federal reserve of approximately billion at the federal reserve the ecb and other nonus central banks as of december compared to billion as of december the lower levels of average cash balances with central banks reflect an increase in the investment portfolio liquid securities carried in our asset liquidity include securities pledged without corresponding advances from the federal reserve bank of boston frbb the fhlb and other nonus central banks state street bank is a member of the fhlb this membership allows for advances of liquidity in varying terms against highquality collateral which helps facilitate assetandliability management as of december we had no outstanding borrowings from the fhlb as of december we had approximately billion of outstanding borrowings from the fhlb access to primary intraday and contingent liquidity provided by these utilities is an important source of contingent liquidity with utilization subject to underlying conditions as of december and december we had no outstanding primary credit borrowings from the frbb discount window or any other central bank facility in addition to the securities included in our asset liquidity we have significant amounts of other unencumbered investment securities these securities are available sources of liquidity although not as rapidly deployed as those included in our asset liquidity the average fair value of total unencumbered securities was billion for the quarter ended december compared to billion for the quarter ended december measures of liquidity include lcr and nsfr which are described in supervision and regulation in business in this form 10k uses of liquidity significant uses of our liquidity could result from the following withdrawals of client deposits drawdowns by our custody clients of lines of credit advances to clients to settle securities transactions or other permitted purposes such circumstances would generally arise under stress conditions including deterioration in credit ratings a recurring use of our liquidity involves our deployment of hqla from our investment portfolio to post collateral to financial institutions serving as sources of securities under our enhanced custody program we had unfunded commitments to extend credit with gross contractual amounts totaling billion and billion and standby letters of credit totaling billion and billion as of december and december respectively these amounts do not reflect the value of any collateral as of december approximately of our unfunded commitments to extend credit and of our standby letters of credit expire within one year since many of our commitments are expected to expire or renew without being drawn upon the gross contractual amounts do not necessarily represent our future cash requirements information about our resolution planning and the impact actions under our resolution plans could have on our liquidity is provided in supervision and regulation in business in this form 10k funding deposits we provide products and services including custody accounting administration daily pricing fx services cash management financial asset management securities finance and investment advisory services as a provider of these products and services we generate client deposits which have generally provided a stable lowcost source of funds as a global custodian clients place deposits with our entities in various currencies as of both december and december approximately of our average total deposit balances were denominated in us dollars approximately in eur in gbp and in all other currencies shortterm funding our onbalance sheet liquid assets are also an integral component of our liquidity management strategy these assets provide liquidity through maturities of the assets but more importantly they provide us with the ability to raise funds by pledging the securities as collateral for borrowings or through outright sales in addition our access to the global capital markets gives us the ability to source incremental funding from wholesale investors as discussed earlier under asset liquidity state street banks membership in the fhlb allows for advances of liquidity with varying terms against highquality collateral shortterm secured funding also comes in the form of securities lent or sold under agreements to repurchase these transactions are shortterm in nature generally overnight and are collateralized by highquality investment securities these balances were billion and billion as of december and december respectively state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of

of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes people and systems or from external events operational risk encompasses fiduciary risk and legal risk fiduciary risk is defined as the risk that we fail to properly exercise our fiduciary duties in our provision of products or services to clients legal risk is the risk of loss resulting from failure to comply with laws and contractual obligations operational risk is inherent in the performance of investment servicing and investment management activities on behalf of our clients whether it be fiduciary risk risk associated with execution and processing or other types of operational risk a consistent transparent and effective operational risk framework is key to identifying monitoring and managing operational risk state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we have established an operational risk framework that is based on three major goals strong active governance ownership and accountability and consistency and transparency governance our board is responsible for the approval and oversight of our overall operational risk framework it does so through its tops which reviews our operational risk framework and approves our operational risk policy annually our operational risk policy establishes our approach to our management of operational risk across our business the policy identifies the responsibilities of individuals and committees charged with oversight of the management of operational risk and articulates a broad mandate that supports implementation of the operational risk framework erm and other control groups provide the oversight validation and verification of the management and measurement of operational risk executive management actively manages and oversees our operational risk framework through membership on various risk management committees including mrac the bcrc torc the operational risk committee the executive information security steering committee business controls steering committee compliance and ethics committee and the fiduciary review committee all of which ultimately report to the appropriate committee of the board the operational risk committee chaired by the global head of operational risk and cochaired by the flod head of business controls provides crossbusiness oversight of operational risk operational risk programs and their implementation to identify measure manage and control operational risk in an effective and consistent manner and reviews and approves operational risk guidelines intended to maintain a consistent implementation of our corporate operational risk policy and framework ownership and accountability we have implemented our operational risk framework to support the broad mandate established by our operational risk policy this framework represents an integrated set of processes and tools that assists us in the management and measurement of operational risk including our calculation of required capital and rwa the framework takes a comprehensive view and integrates the methods and tools used to manage and measure operational risk the framework utilizes aspects of the coso framework and other industry leading practices and is designed foremost to address our risk management needs while complying with regulatory requirements the operational risk framework is intended to provide a number of important benefits including table start a common understanding of operational risk management and its supporting processes table endtable start the clarification of responsibilities for the management of operational risk across our business table endtable start the alignment of business priorities with risk management objectives table endtable start the active management of risk and early identification of emerging risks table endtable start the consistent application of policies and the collection of data for risk management and measurement and table endtable start the estimation of our operational risk capital requirement table end the operational risk framework employs a distributed risk management infrastructure executed by erm groups aligned with the business units which are responsible for the implementation of the operational risk framework at the business unit level as with other risks senior business unit management is responsible for the daytoday operational risk management of their respective businesses it is business unit managements responsibility to provide oversight of the implementation and ongoing execution of the operational risk framework within their respective organizations as well as coordination and communication with erm consistency and transparency a number of corporate control functions are directly responsible for implementing and assessing various aspects of our operational risk framework with the overarching goal of consistency and transparency to meet the evolving needs of the business table start the global head of operational risk a member of the cros executive management team leads erms corporate orm group orm is responsible

with applicable regulatory cybersecurity requirements and monitors the compliance of our systems with information security policies and table endtable start corporate audit performs separate reviews of the application of operational risk management practices and methodologies utilized across our business table end our operational risk framework consists of five components each described below which provide a working structure that integrates distinct risk programs into a continuous process focused on managing and measuring operational risk in a coordinated and consistent manner risk identification and assessments the objective of risk identification and assessments is to understand business unit strategy risk profile and potential exposures it is achieved through a series of risk assessments across our business using techniques for the identification assessment and measurement of risk across a spectrum of potential frequency and severity combinations three primary risk assessment programs which occur annually augmented by other businessspecific programs are the core of this component table start the risk and control assessment program seeks to understand the risks associated with daytoday activities and the effectiveness of controls intended to manage potential exposures arising from these activities these risks are typically frequent in nature but generally not severe in terms of exposure table endtable start the material risk identification process utilizes a bottomup approach to identify our most significant risk exposures across all on and offbalance sheet risktaking activities the program is specifically designed to consider risks that could have a material impact irrespective of their likelihood or frequency this can include risks that may have an impact table end on longerterm business objectives such as significant change management activities or longterm strategic initiatives table start the scenario analysis program focuses on the set of risks with the highest severity and most relevance from a capital perspective these are generally referred to as tail risks and serve as important benchmarks for our loss distribution approach model see below they also provide inputs into stress testing and table endtable start businessspecific programs to identify assess and measure risk including new business and product review and approval new client screening and as deemed appropriate targeted risk assessments table end capital analysis the primary measurement tool used is an internally developed loss distribution approach lda model we use the lda model to quantify required operational risk capital from which we calculate rwa related to operational risk such required capital and rwa totaled billion and billion respectively as of december compared to billion and billion respectively as of december refer to the capital section in financial condition of this managements discussion and analysis the lda model incorporates the four required operational risk elements described below table start internal loss event data is collected from across our business in conformity with our operating loss policy that establishes the requirements for collecting and reporting individual loss events we categorize the data into seven baseldefined event types and further subdivide the data by business unit as deemed appropriate each of these loss events are represented in a uom which is used to estimate a specific amount of capital required for the types of loss events that fall into each specific category some uoms are measured at the corporate level because they are not business specific such as damage to physical assets where the cause of an event is not primarily driven by the behavior of a single business unit internal losses of or greater are captured analyzed and included in the modeling approach loss event data is collected using a corporatewide data collection tool which stores the data in a loss event data repository ledr to support processes related to analysis management reporting and the calculation of required capital internal loss event data provides our frequency and severity information to our capital calculation process for historical loss events experienced by us table end state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations internal loss event data may be incorporated into our lda model in a future quarter following the realization of the losses with the timing and categorization dependent on the processes for model updates and if applicable model revalidation and regulatory review and related supervisory processes an individual loss event can have a significant effect on the output of our lda model and our operational risk rwa under the advanced approaches depending on the severity of the loss event its categorization among the seven baseldefined uoms and the stability of the distributional approach for a particular uom table start external loss event data provides information with respect to loss event severity from other financial institutions to inform our capital estimation process of events in similar business units at other banking organizations this information supplements the data pool available for use in our lda model assessments of the sufficiency of internal data and the relevance of external data are completed before pooling the two data sources for use in our lda model table endtable start scenario analysis workshops are conducted across our business to inform management of the less frequent but most severe or tail risks that the organization faces the workshops are attended by senior business unit managers other support and control partners and businessaligned risk management staff the workshops are designed to capture information about the significant risks and to estimate potential exposures for individual risks should a loss event occur the results of these workshops are used to make a comparison to our lda model results to determine that our calculation of required capital considers relevant riskrelated information and table endtable start business environment and internal control factors are gathered as part of our scenario analysis program to inform the scenario analysis workshop participants of internal loss event data and businessrelevant metrics such as risk assessment program results along with industry loss event data and case studies where appropriate business environment and internal control factors are those characteristics of a banks internal and external operating environment that bear an exposure to operational risk the use of this information indirectly influences our calculation of required capital by providing additional relevant data to workshop participants when reviewing specific uom risks table end monitoring reporting and analytics the objective of risk monitoring is to proactively monitor the changing business environment and corresponding operational risk exposure it is achieved through a series of quantitative and qualitative monitoring tools that are designed to allow us to understand changes in the business environment internal control factors risk metrics risk assessments exposures and operating effectiveness as well as details of loss events and progress on risk initiatives implemented to mitigate potential risk exposures operational risk reporting is intended to provide transparency thereby enabling management to manage risk provide oversight and escalate issues in a timely manner it is designed to allow the business units executive management and the boards control functions and committees to gain insight into activities that may result in risks and potential exposures reports are intended to identify business activities that are experiencing processing issues whether or not they result in actual loss events reporting includes results of monitoring activities internal and external examinations regulatory reviews and control assessments these elements combine in a manner designed to provide a view of potential and emerging risks facing us and information that details its progress on managing risks effectiveness and testing the objective of effectiveness and testing is to verify that internal controls are designed appropriately are consistent with corporate and regulatory standards and are operating effectively it is achieved through a series of assessments by both internal and external parties including corporate audit independent registered public accounting firms business selfassessments and other control function reviews such as a sox testing program consistent with our standard model validation process the operational risk lda model is subject to a detailed review overseen by the mrc in addition the model is subject to a rigorous internal governance process all changes to the model or input parameters and the deployment of model updates are reviewed and approved by the operational risk committee which has oversight responsibility for the model with technical input from the mrc documentation and guidelines documentation and guidelines allow for consistency and repeatability of the various processes that support the operational risk framework across our business operational risk guidelines document our practices and describe the key elements in a business units operational risk management program the purpose of the guidelines is to set forth and define key state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operational risk terms provide further detail on our operational risk programs and detail the business units responsibilities to identify assess measure monitor and report operational risk the guideline supports our operational risk policy data standards have been established to maintain consistent data repositories and systems that are controlled accurate and available on a timely basis to support operational risk management information technology risk management overview and principles we define technology risk as the risk

cyberattacks and have taken steps to mitigate the risks associated with them we have made significant investments in building a mature cybersecurity program to leverage people technology and processes to protect our systems and the data in our care we have also implemented a program to help us better measure and manage the cybersecurity risk we face when we engage with third parties for services all employees are required to adhere to our cybersecurity policy and standards our centralized information security group provides education and training this training includes a required annual online state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations training class for all employees multiple simulated phishing attacks and regular information security awareness materials our business lines employ information security officers to help the business better understand and manage their information security risks as well as to work with the centralized information security team to drive awareness and compliance throughout the business we use independent third parties to perform ethical hacks of key systems to help us better understand the effectiveness of our controls and to better implement more effective controls and we engage with third parties to conduct reviews of our overall program to help us better align our cybersecurity program with what is required of a large financial services organization we have an incident response program in place that is designed to enable a wellcoordinated response to mitigate the impact of cyberattacks recover from the attack and to drive the appropriate level of communication to internal and external stakeholders the torc assesses and manages the effectiveness of our cybersecurity program which is overseen by the tops of our board the tops receives regular cybersecurity updates throughout the year and is responsible for reviewing and approving the program on an annual basis market risk management market risk is defined by us banking regulators as the risk of loss that could result from broad market movements such as changes in the general level of interest rates credit spreads foreign exchange rates or commodity prices we are exposed to market risk in both our trading and certain of our nontrading or assetandliability management activities information about the market risk associated with our trading activities is provided below under trading activities information about the market risk associated with our nontrading activities which consists primarily of interest rate risk is provided below under assetandliability management activities trading activities in the conduct of our trading activities we assume market risk the level of which is a function of our overall risk appetite business objectives and liquidity needs our clients requirements and market volatility and our execution against those factors we engage in trading activities primarily to support our clients needs and to contribute to our overall corporate earnings and liquidity in connection with certain of these trading activities we enter into a variety of derivative financial instruments to support our clients needs and to manage our interest rate and currency risk these activities are generally intended to generate foreign exchange trading services revenue and to manage potential earnings volatility in addition we provide services related to derivatives in our role as both a manager and a servicer of financial assets our clients use derivatives to manage the financial risks associated with their investment goals and business activities with the growth of crossborder investing our clients often enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to convert currency for international investments and to manage the currency risk in their international investment portfolios as an active participant in the foreign exchange markets we provide foreign exchange forward and option contracts in support of these client needs and also act as a dealer in the currency markets as part of our trading activities we assume positions in the foreign exchange and interest rate markets by buying and selling cash instruments and entering into derivative instruments including foreign exchange forward contracts foreign exchange and interest rate options and interest rate swaps interest rate forward contracts and interest rate futures as of december the notional amount of these derivative contracts was trillion of which trillion was composed of foreign exchange forward swap and spot contracts we seek to match positions closely with the objective of minimizing related currency and interest rate risk all foreign exchange contracts are valued daily at current market rates governance our assumption of market risk in our trading activities is an integral part of our corporate risk appetite our board reviews and oversees our management of market risk including the approval of key market risk policies and the receipt and review of regular market risk reporting as well as periodic updates on selected market risk topics the previously described tmrc refer to risk committees oversees all market risktaking activities across our business associated with trading the tmrc which reports to mrac is composed of members of erm our global markets business and our global treasury group as well as our senior executives who manage our trading businesses and other members of management who possess specialized knowledge and expertise the tmrc meets regularly to monitor the management of our trading market risk activities our business units identify actively manage and are responsible for the market risks inherent in their businesses a dedicated market risk management group within erm and other groups within erm work with those business units to assist them in the identification assessment monitoring management and control of market risk and assist business unit managers with their market risk management and state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations measurement activities erm provides an additional line of oversight support and coordination designed to promote the consistent identification measurement and management of market risk across business units separate from those business units discrete activities the erm market risk management group is responsible for the management of corporatewide market risk the monitoring of key market risks and the development and maintenance of market risk management policies guidelines and standards aligned with our corporate risk appetite this group also establishes and approves market risk tolerance limits and trading authorities based on but not limited to measures of notional amounts sensitivity var and stress such limits and authorities are specified in our trading and market risk guidelines which govern our management of trading market risk corporate audit separately assesses the design and operating effectiveness of the market risk controls within our business units and erm other related responsibilities of corporate audit include the periodic review of erm and business unit compliance with market risk policies guidelines and corporate standards as well as relevant regulatory requirements we are subject to regular monitoring reviews and supervisory exams of our market risk function by the federal reserve in addition we are regulated by among others the sec the financial industry regulatory authority and the us commodities futures trading commission risk appetite our corporate market risk appetite is specified in policy statements that outline the governance responsibilities and requirements surrounding the identification measurement analysis management and communication of market risk arising from our trading activities these policy statements also set forth the market risk control framework to monitor support manage and control this portion of our risk appetite all groups involved in the management and control of market risk associated with trading activities are required to comply with the qualitative and quantitative elements of these policy statements our trading market risk control framework is composed of the following components table start a trading market risk management process led by erm separate from the business units discrete activities table endtable start clearly defined responsibilities and authorities for the primary groups involved in trading market risk management table endtable start a trading market risk measurement methodology that captures correlation effects and allows aggregation of market risk across risk

endtable start a new product approval process that requires market risk teams to assess tradingrelated market risks and apply risk tolerance limits to proposed new products and business activities table end we use our cap to assess our overall capital and liquidity in relation to our risk profile and provide a comprehensive strategy for maintaining appropriate capital and liquidity levels with respect to market risk associated with trading activities our risk management and our calculations of regulatory capital are based primarily on our internal var models and stress testing analysis as discussed in detail under valueatrisk below var is measured daily by erm the tmrc oversees our market risk exposure in relation to limits established within our risk appetite framework these limits define threshold levels for var and stressed varbased measures and are applicable to all trading positions subject to regulatory capital requirements these limits are designed to prevent any undue concentration of market risk exposure in light of the primarily nonproprietary nature of our trading activities the risk appetite framework and associated limits are reviewed and approved by the boards rc covered positions our trading positions are subject to regulatory market risk capital requirements if they meet the regulatory definition of a covered position a covered position is generally defined by us banking regulators as an on or offbalance sheet position associated with the organizations trading activities that is free of any restrictions on its tradability but does not include intangible assets certain credit derivatives recognized as guarantees and certain equity positions not publicly state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations traded all fx and commodity positions are considered covered positions regardless of the accounting treatment they receive the identification of covered positions for inclusion in our market risk capital framework is governed by our covered positions policy which outlines the standards we use to determine whether a trading position is a covered position our covered positions consist primarily of the trading portfolios held by our global markets business they also arise from certain positions held by our global treasury group these trading positions include products such as foreign exchange spot foreign exchange forwards nondeliverable forwards foreign exchange options foreign exchange funding swaps currency futures financial futures and interest rate futures new activities are analyzed to determine if the positions arising from such new activities meet the definition of a covered position and conform to our covered positions policy this documented analysis including any decisions with respect to market risk treatments must receive approval from the tmrc we use spot rates forward points yield curves and discount factors imported from thirdparty sources to measure the value of our covered positions and we use such values to mark our covered positions to market on a daily basis these values are subject to separate validation by us in order to evaluate reasonableness and consistency with market experience the marktomarket gain or loss on spot transactions is calculated by applying the spot rate to the foreign currency principal and comparing the resultant base currency amount to the original transaction principal the marktomarket gain or loss on a forward foreign exchange contract or forward cash flow contract is determined as the difference between the lifetodate historical value of the cash flow and the value of the cash flow at the inception of the transaction the marktomarket gain or loss on interest rate swaps is determined by discounting the future cash flows from each leg of the swap transaction valueatrisk and stressed var we use a variety of risk measurement tools and methodologies including var which is an estimate of potential loss for a given period within a stated statistical confidence interval we use a risk measurement methodology to measure tradingrelated var daily we have adopted standards for measuring tradingrelated var and we maintain regulatory capital for market risk associated with our trading activities in conformity with currently applicable bank regulatory market risk requirements we utilize an internal var model to calculate our regulatory market risk capital requirements we use a historical simulation model to calculate daily var and stressed varbased measures for our covered positions in conformity with regulatory requirements our var model seeks to capture identified material risk factors associated with our covered positions including risks arising from market movements such as changes in foreign exchange rates interest rates and optionimplied volatilities we have adopted standards and guidelines to value our covered positions which govern our var and stressed varbased measures our regulatory varbased measure is calculated based on historical volatilities of market risk factors during a twoyear observation period calibrated to a onetail confidence interval and a tenbusinessday holding period we also use the same platform to calculate a onetail confidence interval onebusinessday var for internal risk management purposes a onetail confidence interval implies that daily trading losses are not expected to exceed the estimated var more than of the time or less than three business days out of a year our market risk models including our var model are subject to change in connection with the governance validation and backtesting processes described below these models can change as a result of changes in our business activities our historical experiences market forces and events regulations and regulatory interpretations and other factors in addition the models are subject to continuing regulatory review and approval changes in our models may result in changes in our measurements of our market risk exposures including var and related measures including regulatory capital these changes could result in material changes in those risk measurements and related measures as calculated and compared from period to period we calculate a stressed varbased measure using the same model we use to calculate var but with model inputs calibrated to historical data from a range of continuous twelvemonth periods that reflect significant financial stress the stressed var model is designed to identify the secondworst outcome occurring in the worst continuous oneyear rolling period since july this stressed var meets the regulatory requirement as the rolling tenday period with an outcome that is worse than of other outcomes during that twelvemonth period of financial stress for each portfolio the stress period is determined algorithmically by seeking the oneyear time horizon that produces the largest tenbusinessday var from within the available historical data this historical data set includes the financial crisis of the highly volatile period surrounding the eurozone sovereign debt crisis and the standard poors downgrade of us treasury debt in august as the historical data set used to determine the stress period expands over time future market stress events will be incorporated state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations valueatrisk measures var measures are based on the most recent two years of historical price movements for instruments and related risk factors to which we have exposure the instruments in question are limited to foreign exchange spot forward and options contracts and interest rate contracts including futures and interest rate swaps historically these instruments have exhibited a higher degree of liquidity relative to other available capital markets instruments as a result the var measures shown reflect our ability to rapidly adjust exposures in highly dynamic markets for this reason risk inventory in the form of net open positions across all currencies is typically limited in addition long and short positions in major as well as minor currencies provide risk offsets that limit our potential downside exposure our var methodology uses a historical simulation approach based on marketobserved changes in foreign exchange rates us and nonus interest rates and implied volatilities and incorporates the resulting diversification benefits provided from the mix of our trading positions our var model incorporates approximately risk factors and includes correlations among currency interest rates and other market rates all var measures are subject to limitations and must be interpreted accordingly some but not all of the limitations of our var methodology include the following table start compared to a shorter observation period a twoyear observation period is slower to reflect increases in market volatility although temporary increases in market volatility will affect the calculation of var for a longer period consequently in periods of sudden increases in volatility or increasing volatility in each case relative to the prior twoyear period the calculation of var may understate current risk table endtable start compared to a longer observation period a twoyear observation period may not reflect as many past periods of volatility in the markets because such past volatility is no longer in the observation period consequently historical market scenarios of high volatility even if similar to current or likely future market circumstances may fall outside the twoyear observation period resulting in a potential understatement of current risk table endtable start the varbased measure is calibrated to a specified level of confidence and does not indicate the potential magnitude of losses beyond this confidence level table endtable start in certain cases varbased measures approximate the impact of changes in risk factors on the values of positions and portfolios this may happen because the number of inputs table end included in the var model is necessarily limited for example yield curve risk factors do not exist for all future dates table start the use of historical market information may not be predictive of future events particularly those that are extreme in nature this backwardlooking limitation can cause var to understate or overstate risk table endtable start the effect of extreme and rare market movements is difficult to estimate this may result from nonlinear risk sensitivities as well as the potential for actual volatility and correlation levels to differ from assumptions implicit in the var calculations and table endtable start intraday risk is not captured table end stress testing we have a corporatewide stress testing program in place that incorporates an array of techniques to measure the potential loss we could suffer in a hypothetical scenario of adverse economic and financial conditions we also monitor concentrations of risk such as concentration by branch risk component and currency pairs we conduct stress testing on a daily basis based on selected historical stress events that are relevant to our positions in order to estimate the potential impact to our current portfolio should similar market conditions recur and we also perform stress testing as part of the federal reserves ccar process stress testing is conducted analyzed and reported at the corporate trading desk division and riskfactor level for example exchange risk interest rate risk and volatility risk stress testing results and limits are actively monitored on a daily basis by erm and reported to the tmrc limit breaches are addressed by erm risk managers in conjunction with the business units escalated as appropriate and reviewed by the tmrc if material in addition we have established several action triggers that prompt immediate review by management and the implementation of a remediation plan we perform scenario analysis daily based on selected historical stress events that are relevant to our positions in order to estimate the potential impact to our current portfolio should similar market conditions recur relevant scenarios are chosen from an inventory of historical financial stresses and applied to our current portfolio these historical event scenarios involve spot foreign exchange credit equity unforeseen geopolitical events and natural disasters and government and central bank intervention scenarios examples of the specific historical scenarios we incorporate in our stress testing program may include the asian financial crisis of the september terrorist attacks in the us and the financial crisis we continue to update our inventory of historical stress scenarios as new stress conditions emerge in the financial markets state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as each of the historical stress events is associated with a different time horizon we normalize results by scaling down the longer horizon events to a tenday horizon and keeping the shorter horizon events ie events that are shorter than ten days at their original terms we also conduct sensitivity analysis daily to calculate the impact of a large predefined shock in a specific risk factor or a group of risk factors on our current portfolio these predefined shocks include parallel and nonparallel yield curve shifts and foreign exchange spot and volatility surface shifts in a parallel shift scenario we apply a constant factor shift across all yield curve tenors in a nonparallel shift scenario we apply different shock levels to different tenors of a yield curve rather than shifting the entire curve by a constant amount nonparallel shifts include steepening flattening and butterflies validation and backtesting we perform frequent backtesting to assess the accuracy of our varbased model in estimating loss at the stated confidence level this backtesting involves the comparison of estimated var model outputs to daily actual profitandloss pl outcomes observed from daily market movements we backtest our var model using clean pl which excludes nontrading revenue such as fees commissions and nii as well as estimated revenue from intraday trading our var definition of trading losses excludes items that are not specific to the price movement of the trading assets and liabilities themselves such as fees commissions changes to reserves and gains or losses from intraday activity we experienced two backtesting exceptions in and four backtesting exceptions in at confidence interval the statistical expectation for a var model is to witness one exception every hundred trading days or two to three exceptions per year the backtesting exceptions are therefore within statistical expectation in heightened volatility followed a longer period of relatively benign market conditions that saw the volatility index routinely register as little as or less following such periods it is quite common for var models calibrated to the most recent two years of data to underestimate the trading gains or losses that are experienced as volatility trends above levels that were seen more recently our model validation process also evaluates the integrity of our var models through the use of regular outcome analysis this outcome analysis includes backtesting which compares the var models predictions to actual outcomes using outofsample information consistent with regulatory guidance the backtesting compared clean pl defined above with the oneday var produced by the model the backtesting was performed for a time period not used for model development the number of occurrences where clean tradingbook pl exceeded the oneday var was within our expected var

due to larger fx net open positions the varbased measures presented in the preceding tables are primarily a reflection of the overall level of market volatility and our appetite for taking market risk in our trading activities overall levels of volatility have been low both on an absolute basis and relative to the historical information observed at the beginning of the period used for the calculations both the tenday varbased measures and the stressed varbased measures are based on historical changes observed during rolling tenday periods for the portfolios as of the close of business

primary objective of asset and liability management is to provide sustainable nii under varying economic conditions while protecting the economic value of the assets and liabilities carried on our consolidated statement of condition from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates while many market factors affect the level of nii and the economic value of our assets and liabilities one of the most significant factors is our exposure to movements in interest rates most of our nii is earned from the investment of client deposits generated by our businesses we invest these client deposits in assets that conform generally to the characteristics of our balance sheet liabilities including the currency composition of our significant nonus dollar denominated client liabilities we quantify nii sensitivity using an earnings simulation model that includes our expectations for new business growth changes in balance sheet mix and investment portfolio positioning this measure compares our

nii sensitivity as of december similarly remains poised to benefit from a parallel rise in interest rates and is exposed to a parallel decline in us interest rates compared to december our us dollar nii benefit to higher rates has declined largely driven by the composition of us deposits higher deposit betas and derivative hedging activity nii exposure to lower us rates has remained stable since december as reduced sensitivities to shortend rates is offset by increased exposure to longend rates the reduced nii sensitivity to lower shortend us rates is driven by changes to the composition of us deposits and cash flow hedging activity while increased nii exposure to lower longend us rates is driven by higher levels of mortgagebacked securities in the investment portfolio we are still positioned to benefit from changes in nonus interest rates with the majority of our sensitivity derived from the shortend of the curve given deposit pricing expectations compared to december our nonus benefit to higher rates has decreased while the benefit to lower rates has increased the decreased nii benefit to higher rates is driven by euro deposit pricing actions in addition to the impact of changes to the treatment of excess reserves by the european central bank and swiss national bank the increased benefit to lower rates is largely a result of the aforementioned change in treatment for excess reserves eve sensitivity is a discounted cash flow model designed to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities under a series of interest rate shocks over a longterm horizon in the

financial services industry with large and complex organizations relying on sophisticated models to support numerous aspects of their financial decision making the models contemporaneously represent both a significant advancement in financial management and a source of risk in large banking organizations like us model results influence business decisions and model failure could have a harmful effect on our financial performance as a result the mrm framework seeks to mitigate our model risk our mrm program has three principal components table start a model risk governance program that defines roles and responsibilities including the authority to restrict model usage provides policies and guidance monitors compliance and reports regularly to the board on the overall degree of model risk across the corporation table endtable start a model development process that focuses on sound design and computational accuracy and includes activities designed to test for robustness stability and sensitivity to assumptions and table endtable start an independent model validation function designed to verify that models are conceptually sound computationally accurate are performing as expected and are in line with their design objectives table end governance models used in the regulatory capital calculation can only be deployed for use after undergoing a model validation by erms mrm group the model validation results andor a decision by the model risk committee must permit model usage or the model may not be used erms mrm group is responsible for defining the corporatewide model risk governance framework maintaining policies that achieve the frameworks objectives the team is responsible for overall model risk governance capabilities with particular emphasis in the areas of model validation model risk reporting model performance monitoring tracking of new model development status and committeelevel review and challenge mrc which is composed of senior managers responsible for representing functional areas and business units with key models across the organization reports to mrac and provides guidance and oversight to the mrm function model development and usage models are developed under standards governing data sourcing methodology selection and model integrity testing model development includes a statement of purpose to align development with intended use it also includes a comparison of alternative approaches to promote a sound modeling approach model developers conduct an assessment of data quality and relevance the development teams conduct a variety of tests of the accuracy robustness and stability of each model model owners submit models to the mvg for validation on a regular basis as per the existing policy model validation mvg is part of mrm within erm and performs model validations and reviews mvg is independent as contemplated by applicable bank regulatory requirements of both the developers and users of the models mvg validates models through an evaluation process that assesses the appropriateness accuracy and suitability of data inputs methodologies documentation assumptions and processing code model validation also encompasses an assessment of model performance sensitivity and robustness as well as a models potential limitations given its particular assumptions or deficiencies based on the results of its review mvg issues a model use decision and may require remedial actions andor compensating controls on model use mvg also maintains a model risk rating system which assigns a risk rating to each model based on an assessment of a models inherent and residual risks these ratings aid in the understanding and reporting of model risk across the model portfolio and enable the triaging of needs for remediation although model validation is the primary method of subjecting models to independent review and challenge in practice a multistep governance process provides the opportunity for challenge by multiple parties first mvg conducts a model validation and issues a model use decision mvg communicates their result as one of the following three outcomes approved approved with conditions or not approved there are two ways in which a model can be deemed not approved for use given a validation the aggregation of the model scoring within mrms model risk rating system mrrs model is poor enough to result in a high rating or the scoring of one or more mrrs model elements is deemed critical resulting in an automatic high rating irrespective of the other elements as the critical elements undermines the model second these state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations decisions may be reviewed challenged and confirmed by the mrc finally model use decisions risk ratings and overall levels of model risk may be reported to and reviewed by mrac mrm also reports regularly on model risk issues to the board strategic risk management we define strategic risk as the current or prospective impact on earnings or capital arising from adverse business decisions improper implementation of strategic initiatives or lack of responsiveness to industrywide changes strategic risks are influenced by changes in the competitive environment decline in market performance or changes in our business activities and the potential secondary impacts of reputational risks not already captured as market interest rate credit operational model or liquidity risks we incorporate strategic risk into our assessment of our business plans and risk and capital management processes active management of strategic risk is an integral component of all aspects of our business separating the effects of a potential material adverse event into operational and strategic risk is sometimes difficult for instance the direct financial impact of an unfavorable event in the form of fines or penalties would be classified as an operational risk loss while the impact on our reputation and consequently the potential loss of clients and corresponding decline in revenue would be classified as a strategic risk loss an additional example of strategic risk is the integration of a major acquisition failure to successfully integrate the operations of an acquired business and the resultant inability to retain clients and the associated revenue would be classified as a loss due to strategic risk strategic risk is managed with a longterm focus techniques for its assessment and management include the development of business plans which are subject to robust review and challenge from senior management and the board of directors as well as a formal review and approval process for all new business and product proposals the potential impact of the various elements of strategic risk is difficult to quantify with any degree of precision we use a combination of historical earnings volatility scenario analysis stresstesting and management judgment to help assess the potential effect on us attributable to strategic risk management and control of strategic risks are generally the responsibility of the business units with oversight from the control functions as part of their overall strategic planning and internal risk management processes capital managing our capital involves evaluating whether our actual and projected levels of capital are commensurate with our risk profile are in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements and are sufficient to provide us with the financial flexibility to undertake future strategic business initiatives we assess capital adequacy based on relevant regulatory capital requirements as well as our own internal capital goals targets and other relevant metrics framework our objective with respect to management of our capital is to maintain a strong capital base in order to provide financial flexibility for our business needs including funding corporate growth and supporting clients cash management needs and to provide protection against loss to depositors and creditors we strive to maintain an appropriate level of capital commensurate with our risk profile on which an attractive return to shareholders is expected to be realized over both the short and longterm while protecting our obligations to depositors and creditors and complying with regulatory capital requirements our capital management focuses on our risk exposures the regulatory requirements applicable to us with respect to multiple capital measures the evaluations and resulting credit ratings of the major independent rating agencies our return on capital at both the consolidated and lineofbusiness level and our capital position relative to our peers assessment of our overall capital adequacy includes the comparison of capital sources with capital uses as well as the consideration of the quality and quantity of the various components of capital the assessment seeks to determine the optimal level of capital and composition of capital instruments to satisfy all constituents of capital with the lowest overall cost to shareholders other factors considered in our assessment of capital adequacy are strategic and contingency planning stress testing and planned capital actions capital adequacy process our primary federal banking regulator is the federal reserve both we and state street bank are subject to the minimum regulatory capital requirements established by the federal reserve and defined in the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act state street bank must exceed the regulatory capital thresholds for well capitalized in order for our parent company to maintain its status as a financial holding company accordingly one of our primary objectives with respect to capital management is to exceed all applicable minimum regulatory capital requirements and to be wellcapitalized under the pca guidelines established by the fdic our capital management activities are conducted as part of our corporatewide cap and associated capital policy and guidelines we consider capital adequacy to be a key element of our financial wellbeing which affects our ability to attract and maintain client relationships operate state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations effectively in the global capital markets and satisfy regulatory security holders and shareholder needs capital is one of several elements that affect our credit ratings and the ratings of our principal subsidiaries in conformity with our capital policy and guidelines we strive to achieve and maintain specific internal capital levels not just at a point in time but over time and during periods of stress to account for changes in our strategic direction evolving economic conditions and financial and market volatility we have developed and implemented a corporatewide cap to assess our overall capital in relation to our risk profile and to provide a comprehensive strategy for maintaining appropriate capital levels the cap considers material risks under multiple scenarios with an emphasis on stress scenarios and encompasses existing processes and systems used to measure our capital adequacy capital contingency planning contingency planning is an integral component of capital management the objective of contingency planning is to monitor current and forecast levels of select capital liquidity and other measures that serve as early indicators of a potentially adverse capital or liquidity adequacy situation these measures are one of the inputs used to set our internal capital adequacy level we review these measures annually for appropriateness and relevance in relation to our financial budget and capital plan stress testing we administer a robust businesswide stresstesting program that executes multiple stress tests each year to assess the institutions capital adequacy andor future performance under adverse conditions our stress testing program is structured around what we determine to be the key risks inherent in our business as assessed through a recurring material risk identification process the material risk identification process represents a bottomup approach to identifying the institutions most significant risk exposures across all on and offbalance sheet risktaking activities including credit market liquidity interest rate operational fiduciary business reputation and regulatory risks these key risks serve as an organizing principle for much of our risk management framework as well as reporting including the risk dashboard provided to the board over the past few years stress scenarios have included a deep recession in the us a breakup of the eurozone a severe recession in china and an oil shock precipitated by turmoil in the middle eastnorth africa region in connection with the focus on our key risks each stress test incorporates idiosyncratic loss events tailored to our unique risk profile and business activities due to the nature of our business model and our consolidated statement of condition our risks differ from those of a traditional commercial bank the federal reserve requires bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of billion or more which includes us to submit a capital plan on an annual basis the federal reserve uses its annual ccar process which incorporates hypothetical financial and economic stress scenarios to review those capital plans and assess whether banking organizations have capital planning processes that account for idiosyncratic risks and provide for sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial stress as part of its ccar process the federal reserve assesses each organizations capital adequacy capital planning process and plans to distribute capital such as dividend payments or stock purchase programs management and board risk committees review challenge and approve ccar results and assumptions before submission to the federal reserve through the evaluation of our capital adequacy andor future performance under adverse conditions the stress testing processes provide important insights for capital planning risk management and strategic decisionmaking for us governance

the financial stability board and the basel committee on banking supervision as gsibs our designation as a gsib is based on a number of factors as evaluated by banking regulators and requires us to maintain an additional capital surcharge above the minimum capital ratios set forth in the basel iii rule we and our depositary institution subsidiaries are subject to the current basel iii minimum riskbased capital and leverage ratio guidelines additional information about gsibs is provided under regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity standards in supervision and regulation in business in this form 10k regulatory capital we and state street bank as advanced approaches banking organizations are subject to the us basel iii framework provisions of the basel iii rule became effective with full implementation on january we are also subject to the final market risk capital rule issued by us banking regulators effective as of january the basel iii rule provides for two frameworks for monitoring capital adequacy the standardized approach and the advanced approaches applicable to advanced approaches banking organizations like us the standardized approach prescribes standardized calculations for credit rwa including specified risk weights for certain on and offbalance sheet exposures the advanced approaches consist of the advanced internal ratingsbased approach used for the calculation of rwa related to credit risk and the advanced measurement approach used for the calculation of rwa related to operational risk the market risk capital rule requires us to use internal models to calculate daily measures of var which reflect general market risk for certain of our trading positions defined by the rule as covered positions as well as stressedvar measures to supplement the var measures the rule also requires a public disclosure composed of qualitative and quantitative information about the market risk associated with our trading activities and our related var and stressedvar measures the qualitative and quantitative information required by the rule is provided under market risk included in this managements discussion and analysis as required by the doddfrank act we and state street bank as advanced approaches banking organizations are subject to a permanent capital floor also referred to as the collins amendment in the assessment of our regulatory capital adequacy including the capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer our riskbased capital ratios for regulatory assessment purposes are the lower of each ratio calculated under the standardized approach and the advanced approaches the requirement for the capital conservation buffer became effective with full implementation on january specifically the rule limits a banking organizations ability to make capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers if it fails to maintain a cet1 capital conservation buffer of more than of total rwa and if deployed during periods of excessive credit growth a cet1 countercyclical capital buffer of up to of total rwa above each of the minimum cet1 tier and total riskbased capital ratios the countercyclical capital buffer is currently set at zero by us banking regulators to maintain the status of the parent company as a financial holding company we and our insured depository institution subsidiaries are required among other requirements to be well capitalized as defined by the prompt corrective action framework the specific calculation of our and state street banks riskbased capital ratios changed as the provisions of the basel iii rule related to the numerator capital and denominator rwa were phased in and as our rwa calculated using the advanced approaches changed due to changes in methodology these methodological changes resulted in differences in our reported capital ratios from one reporting period to the next that are independent of applicable changes to our capital base our asset composition our offbalance sheet exposures or our risk profile the following table presents the regulatory capital structure and related regulatory capital ratios for us and state street bank as of the dates indicated we are subject to the more stringent of the riskbased capital ratios calculated under the standardized approach and those calculated under the advanced

quantitative formulae statistical models historical correlations and assumptions collectively referred to as advanced systems in effect and used by us for those purposes as of the time we first reported such ratios in a quarterly report on form 10q or an annual report on form 10k significant components of these advanced systems involve the exercise of judgment by us and our regulators and our advanced systems may not individually or collectively precisely represent or calculate the scenarios circumstances outputs or other results for which they are designed or intended our advanced systems are subject to update and periodic revalidation in response to changes in our business activities and our historical experiences forces and events experienced by the market broadly or by individual financial institutions changes in regulations and regulatory interpretations and other factors and are also subject to continuing regulatory review and approval for example a significant operational loss experienced by another financial institution even if we do not experience a related loss could result in a material change in the output of our advanced systems and a corresponding material change in our risk exposures our total rwa and our capital ratios compared to prior periods an operational loss that we experience could also result in a material change in our capital requirements for operational risk under the advanced approaches depending on the severity of the loss event its characterization among the seven baseldefined uom and the stability of the distributional approach for a particular uom and without direct correlation to the effects of the loss event or the timing of such effects on our results of operations due to the influence of changes in these advanced systems whether resulting from changes in data inputs regulation or regulatory supervision or interpretation specific to us or market activities or experiences or other updates or factors we expect that our advanced systems and our capital ratios calculated in conformity with the basel iii rule will change and may be volatile over time and that those latter changes or

securities lending program we lend securities to banks brokerdealers and other institutions in most circumstances we indemnify our clients for the fair market value of those securities against a failure of the borrower to return such securities though these transactions are collateralized the substantial volume of these activities necessitates detailed creditbased underwriting and monitoring processes the aggregate amount of indemnified securities on loan totaled billion and billion as of december and december respectively we require the borrower to provide collateral in an amount in excess of of the fair market value of the securities borrowed we hold the collateral received in connection with these securities lending services as agent and the collateral is not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition we revalue the securities on loan and the collateral daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary or if excess collateral is required to be returned to the borrower we held as agent cash and securities totaling billion and billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan as of december and december respectively the cash collateral held by us as agent is invested on behalf of our clients in certain cases the cash collateral is invested in thirdparty repurchase agreements for which we indemnify the client against loss of the principal

determination of amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements additional information on our significant accounting policies including references to applicable footnotes is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k certain of our accounting policies by their nature require management to make judgments involving significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain these estimates and assumptions are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and changes in this information over time could materially affect the amounts of assets liabilities equity revenue and expenses reported in subsequent consolidated financial statements based on the sensitivity of reported financial statement amounts to the underlying estimates and assumptions the more significant accounting policies applied by us have been identified by management as those associated with recurring fair value measurements impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets and contingencies these accounting policies require the most subjective or complex judgments and underlying estimates and assumptions could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available an understanding of the judgments estimates and assumptions underlying these accounting policies is essential in order to understand our reported consolidated results of operations and financial condition the following is a discussion of the abovementioned significant accounting estimates state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management has discussed these significant accounting estimates with the ea committee of the board fair value measurements we carry certain of our financial assets and liabilities at fair value in our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis including trading account assets and liabilities afs debt securities certain equity securities and various types of derivative financial instruments changes in the fair value of these financial assets and liabilities are recorded either as components of our consolidated statement of income or as components of other comprehensive income within shareholders equity in our consolidated statement of condition in addition to those financial assets and liabilities that we carry at fair value in our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis we estimate the fair values of other financial assets and liabilities that we carry at amortized cost in our consolidated statement of condition and we disclose these fair value estimates in the notes to our consolidated financial statements we estimate the fair values of these financial assets and liabilities using the definition of fair value described below additional information with respect to the assets and liabilities carried by us at fair value on a recurring basis is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k us gaap defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for an asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date when we measure fair value for our financial assets and liabilities we consider the principal or the most advantageous market in which we would transact we also consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability when possible we look to active and observable markets to measure the fair value of identical or similar financial assets and liabilities when identical financial assets and liabilities are not traded in active markets we look to marketobservable data for similar assets and liabilities in some instances certain assets and liabilities are not actively traded in observable markets as a result we use alternate valuation techniques to measure their fair value we categorize the financial assets and liabilities that we carry at fair value in our consolidated statement of condition on a recurring basis based on us gaaps prescribed threelevel valuation hierarchy the hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level and the lowest priority to valuation methods using significant unobservable inputs level with respect to derivative instruments we evaluated the fair value impact of the credit risk of our counterparties we considered such factors as the marketbased probability of default by our counterparties and our current and expected potential future net exposures by remaining maturities in determining the appropriate measurements of fair value goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net tangible and other intangible assets acquired at the acquisition date other intangible assets represent purchased longlived intangible assets primarily client relationships core deposit intangible assets and technology that can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual rights or because the asset can be exchanged on its own or in combination with a related contract asset or liability other intangible assets are initially measured at their acquisition date fair value the determination of which requires management judgment goodwill is not amortized while other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives management reviews goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances arise or events occur that indicate an impairment of the carrying amount may exist we begin our review by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount events that may indicate impairment include significant or adverse changes in the business economic or political climate an adverse action or assessment by a regulator unanticipated competition and a morelikelythannot expectation that we will sell or otherwise dispose of a business to which the goodwill or other intangible assets relate if we conclude from the qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment that it is more likely than not that a reporting units fair value is greater than its carrying amount quantitative tests are not required however if we determine it is more likely than not that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount then we complete a quantitative assessment to determine if there is goodwill impairment we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and complete a quantitative assessment in any given year in due to the passage of time since the last quantitative test we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and we assessed goodwill for impairment using a quantitative approach we determined there was no goodwill impairment in other intangible assets are supported by the future cash flows that are directly associated with and expected to arise as a direct result of the use of the intangible asset less any costs associated with the intangible assets eventual disposition we evaluate state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations other intangible assets for impairment at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows from other groups of assets using the following process first we routinely assess whether impairment indicators are present when impairment indicators are identified as being present we compare the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows of the intangible asset with its carrying value if the future net undiscounted cash flows are greater than the carrying value then there is no impairment but if the intangible assets net undiscounted cash flows are less than its carrying value we are required to calculate impairment an impairment is recognized by writing the intangible asset down to its fair value we evaluate intangible assets for indicators of impairment on a quarterly basis there were no impairments taken on other intangible assets in additional
