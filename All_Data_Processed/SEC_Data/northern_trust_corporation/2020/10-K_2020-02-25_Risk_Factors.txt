item risk factors in the normal course of our business activities we are exposed to a variety of risks the following discussion sets forth the risk factors that we have identified as being most significant to northern trust although we discuss these risk factors primarily in the context of their potential effects on our business financial condition or results of operations you should understand that these effects can have further negative implications such as reducing the price of our common stock and other securities reducing our capital which can have regulatory and other consequences affecting the confidence that clients and counterparties have in us with a resulting negative effect on our ability to conduct and grow our businesses and reducing the attractiveness of our securities to rating agencies and potential purchasers which may affect adversely our ability to raise capital and secure other funding or the cost at which we are able to do so further additional risks beyond those discussed below elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k or in other of our reports filed with or furnished to the sec also could affect us adversely we cannot assure you that the risk factors herein or elsewhere in our other reports address all potential risks that we may face these risk factors also serve to describe factors which may cause our results to differ materially from those described in forwardlooking statements included herein or in other documents or statements that make reference to this annual report on form 10k forwardlooking statements and other factors that may affect future results are discussed under forwardlooking statements included in item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form 10k market risks we are dependent on feebased business for a majority of our revenues which may be affected adversely by market volatility a downturn in economic conditions underperformance andor negative trends in investment preferences our principal operational focus is on feebased business which is distinct from commercial banking institutions that earn most of their revenues from loans and other traditional interestgenerating products and services fees for many of our products and services are based on the market value of assets under management custody or administration the volume of transactions processed securities lending volume and spreads and fees for other services rendered all of which may be impacted negatively by market volatility a downturn in economic conditions underperformance andor negative trends in investment preferences for example downturns in equity markets and decreases in the value of debtrelated investments resulting from market disruption illiquidity or other factors historically have reduced the valuations of the assets we manage or service for others which generally impacted our earnings negatively market volatility andor weak economic conditions also may affect wealth creation investment preferences trading activities and savings patterns which impact demand for certain products and services that we provide our earnings also may be affected by poor investment returns or changes in investment preferences driven by factors beyond market volatility or weak economic conditions for example poor investment performance in funds or client accounts that we manage or in investment products that we design or provide that is due to underperformance relative to our competitors or benchmarks could result in declines in the market values of portfolios that we manage andor administer and may affect our ability to retain existing assets and to attract new clients or additional assets from existing clients further broader changes in investment preferences that lead to less investment in mutual funds or other collective funds such as the shift in investor preference to lower fee products could impact our earnings negatively changes in interest rates can affect our earnings negatively the direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings interest rates generally remain low relative to historical levels low interest rate environments have had in the past and may have in the future a negative impact on our net interest margin which is the difference between what we earn on our assets and the interest rates we pay for deposits and other sources of funding low interest rate environments also have historically had a negative impact on our fees earned on certain of our products for example in the past we have from time to time waived certain fees associated with money market mutual funds due to shortterm interest rate levels and we may do so in the future if shortterm interest rate levels decline low net interest margins and fee waivers each negatively impact our earnings conversely in some circumstances a rise in interest rates also may affect us negatively for example we may be impacted negatively if such an increase were to cause market volatility and downturns in equity markets resulting in a decrease in the valuations of the assets we manage or service for others which generally impact our earnings negatively our clients to transfer funds into investments with higher rates of return resulting in decreased deposit levels and higher fund or account redemptions our borrowers to experience difficulties in making higher interest payments resulting in increased credit costs provisions for loan and lease losses and chargeoffs reduced bond and fixed income fund liquidity resulting in lower performance yields and fees a decline in the value of securities held in our portfolio of investment securities resulting in decreased levels of capital and liquidity or higher funding costs table start annual report northern trust corporation table end further although we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of interest rate risks if our assumptions about any number of variables are incorrect these policies and procedures to mitigate risk may be ineffective which could impact earnings negatively please see market risk in the risk management section included in item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form 10k for a more detailed discussion of interest rate and market risks we face changes in the monetary trade and other policies of various regulatory authorities central banks governments and international agencies may reduce our earnings and affect our growth prospects negatively the monetary trade and other policies of us and international governments agencies and regulatory bodies have a significant impact on economic conditions and overall financial market performance for example the federal reserve board regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states and its policies determine in large part the level of interest rates and our cost of funds for lending and investing which are important factors in our earnings the actions of the federal reserve board or other regulatory authorities also may reduce the value of financial instruments we hold further their policies can affect our borrowers by increasing interest rates or making sources of funding less available which may increase the risk that borrowers fail to repay their loans from us changes in monetary trade and other governmental policies are beyond our control and can be difficult to predict and we cannot determine the ultimate effect that any such changes would have upon our business financial condition or results of operations the ultimate impact on us of the united kingdoms withdrawal from the european union remains uncertain in june united kingdom uk voters approved a departure from the european union eu commonly referred to as brexit following delivery of the uks formal notice of withdrawal in march a subsequent negotiation period and approval of a withdrawal agreement by each of the uk and the eu the uk formally exited the eu on january the ultimate impact of brexit on the corporation and the bank remains uncertain and will depend on the final terms of the postbrexit relationships negotiated between the uk and other eu nations brexit has contributed and may continue to contribute to market volatility particularly the valuation of the euro and british pound and could have significant adverse effects on our businesses financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our brexitrelated preparations and to mitigate the potential risk that our uk subsidiaries will be unable to retain their eu financial services passports we have implemented certain changes to our organizational structure including the establishment of an eudomiciled credit institution in luxembourg we have incurred and may in the future continue to incur additional costs associated with such measures and unforeseen political regulatory or other developments related to brexit or operational issues associated with the organizational restructuring related thereto also may result in additional costs and disruption to our eu banking business uncertainty about the financial stability of various regions or countries across the globe including the risk of defaults on sovereign debt and related stresses on financial markets could have a significant adverse effect on our earnings risks and concerns about the financial stability of various regions or countries across the globe could have a detrimental impact on economic and market conditions in these or other markets across the world foreign market and economic disruptions have affected and may in the future affect consumer confidence levels and spending personal bankruptcy rates levels of incurrence of and default on consumer debt and home prices economic challenges faced in various foreign markets including negative interest rates in some jurisdictions or lack of confidence in the financial markets may adversely affect certain portions of our business financial condition and results of operations declines in the value of securities held in our investment portfolio can affect us negatively our investment securities portfolio represents a greater proportion and our loan and lease portfolios represent a smaller proportion of our total consolidated assets in comparison to many other financial institutions the value of securities available for sale and held to maturity within our investment portfolio which is generally determined based upon market values available from thirdparty sources may fluctuate as a result of market volatility and economic or financial market conditions declines in the value of securities held in our investment portfolio negatively impact our levels of capital and liquidity although we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of market risks including hedgingrelated strategies those policies and procedures are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or future development of currently unanticipated or unknown risks accordingly we could suffer adverse effects as a result of our failure to anticipate and manage these risks properly table start annual report northern trust corporation table end volatility levels and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may affect our earnings we provide foreign exchange services to our clients primarily in connection with our global custody business foreign currency volatility influences our foreign exchange trading income as does the level of client activity foreign currency volatility and changes in client activity may result in reduced foreign exchange trading income fluctuations in exchange rates may raise the potential for losses resulting from foreign currency trading positions where aggregate obligations to purchase and sell a currency other than the us dollar do not offset each other or offset each other in different time periods we also are exposed to nontrading foreign currency risk as a result of our holdings of nonus dollar denominated assets and liabilities investments in nonus subsidiaries and future nonus dollar denominated revenue and expense we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of foreign exchange risks including hedgingrelated strategies any failure or circumvention of our procedures to mitigate risk may impact earnings negatively please see market risk in the risk management section included in item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form 10k for a more detailed discussion of market risks we face changes in a number of particular market conditions can affect our earnings negatively in past periods reductions in the volatility of currencytrading markets the level of crossborder investing activity and the demand for borrowing securities or willingness to lend such securities have affected our earnings from activities such as foreign exchange trading and securities lending negatively if these conditions occur in the future our earnings from these activities may be affected negatively in a few of our businesses such as securities lending our fee is calculated as a percentage of our clients earnings such that market and other factors that reduce our clients earnings from investments or trading activities also reduce our revenues operational risks many types of operational risks can affect our earnings negatively we regularly assess and monitor operational risk in our businesses despite our efforts to assess and monitor operational risk our risk management program may not be effective in all cases factors that can impact operations and expose us to risks varying in size scale and scope include table start failures of technological systems or breaches of security measures including but not limited to those resulting from computer viruses or cyberattacks table endtable start human errors or omissions including failures to comply with applicable laws or corporate policies and procedures table endtable start theft fraud or misappropriation of assets whether arising from the intentional actions of internal personnel or external third parties table endtable start defects or interruptions in computer or communications systems table endtable start breakdowns in processes overreliance on manual processes which are inherently more prone to error than automated processes breakdowns in internal controls or failures of the systems and facilities that support our operations table endtable start unsuccessful or difficult implementation of computer systems upgrades table endtable start defects in product design or delivery table endtable start difficulty in accurately pricing assets which can be aggravated by market volatility and illiquidity and lack of reliable pricing from thirdparty vendors table endtable start negative developments in relationships with key counterparties thirdparty vendors employees or associates in our daytoday operations and table endtable start external events that are wholly or partially beyond our control such as natural disasters pandemics geopolitical events political unrest or acts of terrorism table end while we have in place many controls and business continuity plans designed to address many of these factors these plans may not operate successfully to mitigate these risks effectively we also may fail to identify or fully understand the implications and risks associated with changes in the financial markets or our businessesparticularly as we expand our geographic footprint product pipeline and client typesand consequently fail to enhance our controls and business continuity plans to address those changes in an adequate or timely fashion if our controls and business continuity plans do not address the factors noted above and operate to mitigate the associated risks successfully such factors may have a negative impact on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition an important aspect of managing our operational risk is creating a risk culture in which all employees fully understand that there is risk in every aspect of our business and the importance of managing risk as it relates to their job functions we continue to enhance our risk management program to support our risk culture ensuring that it is sustainable and appropriate for our role as a major financial institution nonetheless if we fail to provide the appropriate environment that sensitizes all of our employees to managing risk our business could be impacted adversely table start annual report northern trust corporation table end failures of our technological systems or breaches of our security measures including but not limited to those resulting from cyberattacks may result in losses any failure interruption or breach in the security of our systems could severely disrupt our operations our systems involve the use of clients and our proprietary and confidential information and security breaches including cyberattacks could expose us to a risk of theft loss or other misappropriation of this information our security measures may be breached due to the actions of outside parties employee error failure of our controls with respect to granting access to our systems malfeasance or otherwise and as a result an unauthorized party may obtain access to our or our clients proprietary and confidential information resulting in theft loss or other misappropriation of this information regulators globally are also introducing the potential for greater monetary fines on institutions that suffer from breaches leading to the theft loss or other misappropriation of such information most states the eu and other nonus jurisdictions also have adopted their own statutes andor regulations concerning data privacy and security and requiring notification of data breaches for example the general data protection regulation gdpr which became effective in may establishes new requirements regarding the handling of personal information noncompliance with the gdpr may result in monetary penalties of up to of worldwide revenue in the united states the california consumer privacy act ccpa was adopted by the state of california and became effective january the ccpa substantially increases the rights of california residents to understand how their personal data is collected and used by commercial businesses and includes a private right of action permitting lawsuits to be brought by private individuals instead of the state attorney general or other government actor for breaches these and other changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of personal and other types of information could greatly increase the size of potential fines related to the protection of such information information security risks for large financial institutions like us are significant in part because of the proliferation of new technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of hackers terrorists organized crime and other external parties including foreign state actors if we fail to continue to upgrade our technology infrastructure to ensure effective information security relative to the type size and complexity of our operations we could become more vulnerable to cyberattack and consequently subject to significant regulatory penalties additionally our computer communications data processing networks backup business continuity or other operating information or technology systems including those that we outsource to other providers may fail to operate properly or become disabled overloaded or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control which could have a negative effect on our ability to conduct our business activities the third parties with which we do business also are susceptible to the foregoing risks including regarding the third parties with which they are similarly interconnected or on which they otherwise rely and our or their business operations and activities may therefore be affected adversely perhaps materially by failures terminations errors or malfeasance by or attacks or constraints on one or more financial technology infrastructure or government institutions or intermediaries with whom we or they are interconnected or conduct business in addition our clients often use their own devices such as computers smart phones and tablets to manage their accounts which may heighten the risk of system failures interruptions or security breaches in recent years several financial services firms suffered successful cyberattacks launched both domestically and from abroad resulting in the disruption of services to clients loss or misappropriation of sensitive or private information and reputational harm although we have not to our knowledge suffered a material breach of our systems we and our clients have been subject to cyberattacks and it is possible that we could suffer a material breach in the future because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques to implement adequate preventative measures or to address them until they are discovered in addition a successful cyberattack could persist for an extended period of time before being detected because any investigation of an information security incident would be inherently unpredictable the extent of a particular information security incident and the path of investigating the incident may not be immediately clear it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed and full and reliable information about the incident is known while such an investigation is ongoing we may not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated and communication to the public regulators clients and other stakeholders may be inaccurate any or all of which could further increase the costs and consequences of an information security incident we expect to continue to face a wide variety of cyberthreats including computer viruses ransomware and other malicious code distributed denial of service attacks phishing attacks information security breaches or employee or contractor error or malfeasance that could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of our our clients or other parties confidential personal proprietary or other information or otherwise disrupt compromise or damage our or our clients or other parties business assets operations and activities our status as a global financial institution and the nature of our client base may enhance the risk that we are targeted by such cyberthreats if a breach of our security occurs we could be the subject of legal claims or proceedings including regulatory investigations and actions the market perception of the table start annual report northern trust corporation table end effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed our reputation could suffer and we could lose clients each of which could have a negative effect on our business financial condition and results of operations a breach of our security also may affect adversely our ability to effect transactions service our clients manage our exposure to risk or expand our business an event that results in the loss of information also may require us to reconstruct lost data or reimburse clients for data and credit monitoring services which could be costly and have a negative impact on our business and reputation further even if not directed at us attacks on financial or other institutions important to the overall functioning of the financial system or on our counterparties could affect directly or indirectly aspects of our business errors breakdowns in controls or other mistakes in the provision of services to clients or in carrying out transactions for our own account can subject us to liability result in losses or have a negative effect on our earnings in other ways in our asset servicing investment management fiduciary administration and other business activities we effect or process transactions for clients and for ourselves that involve very large amounts of money failure to manage or mitigate operational risks properly can have adverse consequences and increased volatility in the financial markets may increase the magnitude of resulting losses given the high volume of transactions we process errors that affect earnings may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and corrected our dependence on technology and the need to update frequently our technology infrastructure exposes us to risks that also can result in losses our businesses depend on information technology infrastructure both internal and external to record and process among other things a large volume of increasingly complex transactions and other data in many currencies on a daily basis across numerous and diverse markets and jurisdictions due to our dependence on technology and the important role it plays in our business operations we must constantly improve and update our information technology infrastructure upgrading replacing and modernizing these systems can require significant resources and often involves implementation integration and security risks that could cause financial reputational and operational harm failure to ensure adequate review and consideration of critical business and regulatory issues prior to and during the introduction and deployment of key technological systems or failure to align operational capabilities adequately with evolving client commitments and expectations may have a negative impact on our results of operations the failure to respond properly to and invest in changes and advancements in technology could limit our ability to attract and retain clients prevent us from offering products and services comparable to those offered by our competitors inhibit our ability to meet regulatory requirements or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our operations the systems and models we employ to analyze monitor and mitigate risks as well as for other business purposes are inherently limited may not be effective in all cases and in any case cannot eliminate all risks that we face we use various systems and models in analyzing and monitoring several risk categories as well as for other business purposes however these systems and models are inherently limited because they involve techniques and judgments that cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome in the markets in which we operate nor can they anticipate the specifics and timing of such outcomes further these systems and models may fail to quantify accurately the magnitude of the risks we face our measurement methodologies rely on many assumptions and historical analyses and correlations these assumptions may be incorrect and the historical correlations on which we rely may not continue to be relevant consequently the measurements that we make may not adequately capture or express the true risk profiles of our businesses or provide accurate data for other business purposes each of which ultimately could have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations errors in the underlying model or model assumptions or inadequate model assumptions could result in unanticipated and adverse consequences including material loss or noncompliance with regulatory requirements or expectations table start annual report northern trust corporation table end a failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we regularly review and update our internal controls disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures any system of controls however well designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system will be met any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are otherwise required to restate our financial statements we could be required to implement expensive and timeconsuming remedial measures and could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports in addition there are risks that individuals either employees or contractors consciously circumvent established control mechanisms by for example exceeding trading or investment management limitations or committing fraud failure of any of our thirdparty vendors to perform can result in losses thirdparty vendors provide key components of our business operations such as data processing recording and monitoring transactions online banking interfaces and services and network access our use of thirdparty vendors exposes us to the risk that such vendors may not comply with their servicing and other contractual obligations to us including with respect to indemnification and information security and to the risk that we may not satisfy applicable regulatory responsibilities regarding the management and oversight of third parties and outsourcing providers while we have established risk management processes and continuity plans any disruptions in service from a key vendor for any reason or poor performance of services could have a negative effect on our ability to deliver products and services to our clients and conduct our business replacing these thirdparty vendors or performing the tasks they perform for ourselves could create significant delay and expense we are subject to certain risks inherent in operating globally which may affect our business adversely in conducting our us and nonus business we are subject to risks of loss from various unfavorable political economic legal or other developments including social or political instability changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks expropriation nationalization confiscation of assets price controls capital controls exchange controls unfavorable tax rates and tax court rulings and changes in laws and regulations less mature and often less regulated business and investment environments heighten these risks in various emerging markets in which we have been expanding our business activities our nonus operations accounted for of our revenue in our nonus businesses are subject to extensive regulation by various nonus regulators including governments securities exchanges central banks and other regulatory bodies in the jurisdictions in which those businesses operate in many countries the laws and regulations applicable to the financial services industry are uncertain and evolving and may be applied with extra scrutiny to foreign companies moreover the regulatory and supervisory standards and expectations in one jurisdiction may not conform with standards or expectations in other jurisdictions even within a particular jurisdiction the standards and expectations of multiple supervisory agencies exercising authority over our affairs may not be harmonized fully accordingly it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market or manage our relationships with multiple regulators in various jurisdictions our inability to remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market and manage our relationships with regulators could have an adverse effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally the failure to mitigate properly such risks or the failure of our operating infrastructure to support such international activities could result in operational failures and regulatory fines or sanctions which could affect our business and results of operations adversely we actively strive to optimize our geographic footprint this optimization may occur by establishing operations in lowercost locations or by outsourcing to thirdparty vendors in various jurisdictions these efforts expose us to the risk that we may not maintain service quality control or effective management within these operations in addition we are exposed to the relevant macroeconomic political and similar risks generally involved in doing business in those jurisdictions the increased elements of risk that arise from conducting certain operating processes in some jurisdictions could lead to an increase in reputational risk during periods of transition greater operational risk and client concern exist with respect to maintaining a high level of service delivery in addition we are subject in our global operations to rules and regulations relating to corrupt and illegal payments money laundering and laws relating to doing business with certain individuals groups and countries such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the usa patriot act the uk bribery act and economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by the us office of foreign assets control and similar agencies worldwide while we have invested and continue to invest significant resources in training and in compliance monitoring the geographic diversity of our operations employees clients and customers as well as the vendors and other third parties with whom we deal presents the risk that we may be found in violation of such rules regulations laws or programs and any such violation could subject us to significant penalties or affect our reputation adversely table start annual report northern trust corporation table end failure to control our costs and expenses adequately could affect our earnings negatively our success in controlling the costs and expenses of our business operations also impacts operating results through various parts of our business strategy we aim to produce efficiencies in operations that help reduce and control costs and expenses including the costs of losses associated with operating risks attributable to servicing and managing financial assets failure to control these and other costs could affect our earnings negatively and reduce our competitive position in october we announced our value for spend expense management initiative with the goal of realizing million in expense runrate savings by through improved organizational alignment process optimization and strategic sourcing although we have made substantial progress toward achieving this goal we cannot predict its overall effect on our financial condition or results of operations in the future acts of terrorism natural disasters global climate change pandemics and global conflicts may have a negative impact on our business and operations acts of terrorism natural disasters global climate change pandemics global conflicts or other similar events could have a negative impact on our business and operations while we have in place business continuity plans such events could still damage our facilities disrupt or delay the normal operations of our business including communications and technology result in harm to or cause travel limitations on our employees and have a similar impact on our clients suppliers thirdparty vendors and counterparties these events also could impact us negatively to the extent that they result in reduced capital markets activity lower asset price levels or disruptions in general economic activity in the united states or abroad or in financial market settlement functions in addition these or similar events may impact economic growth negatively which could have an adverse effect on our business and operations and may have other adverse effects on us in ways that we are unable to predict credit risks failure to evaluate accurately the prospects for repayment when we extend credit or maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses can result in losses or the need to make additional provisions for credit losses both of which reduce our earnings we evaluate extensions of credit before we make them and then provide for credit risks based on our assessment of the credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio including undrawn credit commitments this process requires us to make difficult and complex judgments challenges associated with our credit risk assessments include identifying the proper factors to be used in assessments and accurately estimating the impacts of those factors allowances that prove to be inadequate may require us to realize increased provisions for credit losses or write down the value of certain assets on our balance sheet which in turn would affect earnings negatively market volatility andor weak economic conditions can result in losses or the need for additional provisions for credit losses both of which reduce our earnings credit risk levels and our earnings also can be affected by market volatility andor weakness in the economy in general and in the particular locales in which we extend credit a deterioration in credit quality or a reduced demand for credit adverse changes in the financial performance or condition of our borrowers resulting from market volatility andor weakened economic conditions could impact the borrowers abilities to repay outstanding loans which could in turn impact our financial condition and results of operations negatively table start annual report northern trust corporation table end the failure or perceived weakness of any of our significant counterparties could expose us to loss the financial markets are characterized by extensive interconnections among financial institutions including banks brokerdealers collective investment funds and insurance companies as a result of these interconnections we and many of our clients have counterparty exposure to other financial institutions this counterparty exposure presents risks to us and to our clients because the failure or perceived weakness of any of our counterparties has the potential to expose us to risk of loss instability in the financial markets has resulted historically in some financial institutions becoming less creditworthy during such periods of instability we are exposed to increased counterparty risks both as principal and in our capacity as agent for our clients changes in market perception of the financial strength of particular financial institutions can occur rapidly are often based upon a variety of factors and can be difficult to predict in addition the criteria for and manner of governmental support of financial institutions and other economically important sectors remain uncertain further the consolidation of financial services firms and the failures of other financial institutions has in the past and may in the future increase the concentration of our counterparty risk these risks are heightened by the fact that our operating model relies on the use of unaffiliated subcustodians to a greater degree than certain of our competitors that have banking operations in more jurisdictions than we do we are not able to mitigate all of our and our clients counterparty credit risk if a significant individual counterparty defaults on an obligation to us we could incur financial losses that have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations changes in the method pursuant to which the london interbank offered rate libor or other interest rate benchmarks are determined could adversely impact our business and results of operations many financial markets currently rely on interbank offered rates each an ibor as mutually agreed upon reference rates serving as the basis for the pricing and valuation of assets trading positions loans and other financial transactions following historical concerns about attempted manipulation of ibor levels as well as a potential lack of liquidity in the underlying activity that contributes to an ibor setting global regulators have signaled interest in replacing existing ibor rates with alternative reference rates while there are multiple ibors libor is the most widely used interest rate benchmark in the world and serves as the reference rate for our floatingrate funding certain of the products that we own or offer various lending and securities transactions in which we are involved and many derivatives that we use to manage our or our clients risk in july the united kingdom financial conduct authority which regulates the process for establishing libor announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor to the administrator of libor after and as a result the continuation of libor on the current basis cannot be guaranteed after any change in the availability or calculation of libor or other interest rate benchmarks may affect adversely the cost or availability of floatingrate funding the yield on loans or securities held by us the amounts received and paid on derivative instruments we have entered into the value of loans securities or derivative instruments held by us or our clients which in the case of assets held by our clients could also negatively impact the amount of fees we earn in relation to such assets the trading market for securities based on libor or other benchmarks the terms of new loans being made using different or modified reference rates or our ability to use derivative instruments to manage risk effectively while we are working to facilitate an orderly transition from libor to alternative interest rate benchmarks for us and our clients there continues to be uncertainty regarding the effect that these developments any discontinuance modification or other reforms to libor or any other interest rate benchmarks or the establishment of alternative reference rates may have on libor or other interest rate benchmarks further the potential transition away from the use of libor or other interest rate benchmarks or uncertainty related to any such potential transition may cause us to recognize additional costs or experience operational disruptions which may negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations liquidity risks if we do not manage our liquidity effectively our business could suffer liquidity is essential for the operation of our business market conditions unforeseen outflows of funds or other events could have a negative effect on our level or cost of funding affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations and fund new business transactions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner if our access to stable and lowcost sources of funding such as customer deposits is reduced we may need to use alternative funding which could be more expensive or of limited availability further evolution in the regulatory requirements relating to liquidity and risk management also may impact us negatively additional regulations may impose more stringent liquidity requirements for large financial institutions including the corporation and the bank given the overlap and complex interactions of these regulations with other regulatory changes the full impact of the adopted and proposed regulations remains uncertain until their full implementation for more information on these regulations and other regulatory changes see supervision and regulationliquidity standards in item business of this annual report on form 10k any substantial unexpected or prolonged changes in the level or cost of liquidity could affect our business adversely table start annual report northern trust corporation table end if the bank is unable to supply the corporation with funds over time the corporation could be unable to meet its various obligations the corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank and the corporations other subsidiaries the corporation relies on dividends paid to it by the bank to meet its obligations and to pay dividends to stockholders of the corporation there are various legal limitations on the extent to which the bank and the corporations other subsidiaries can supply funds to the corporation by dividend or otherwise dividend payments by the bank to the corporation in the future will require continued generation of earnings by the bank and could require regulatory approval under certain circumstances for more information on dividend restrictions see supervision and regulationpayment of dividends in item business of this annual report on form 10k we may need to raise additional capital in the future which may not be available to us or may only be available on unfavorable terms we may need to raise additional capital to provide sufficient resources to meet our business needs and commitments to accommodate the transaction and cash management needs of our clients to maintain our credit ratings in response to regulatory changes including capital rules or for other purposes however our ability to access the capital markets if needed will depend on a number of factors including the state of the financial markets rising interest rates disruptions in financial markets negative perceptions of our business or our financial strength or other factors may impact our ability to raise additional capital if needed on terms acceptable to us any diminished ability to raise additional capital if needed could subject us to liability restrict our ability to grow require us to take actions that would affect our earnings negatively or otherwise affect our business and our ability to implement our business plan capital plan and strategic goals adversely any downgrades in our credit ratings or an actual or perceived reduction in our financial strength could affect our borrowing costs capital costs and liquidity adversely rating agencies publish credit ratings and outlooks on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities including longterm debt shortterm borrowings preferred stock and other securities our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by the rating agencies and thus may change from time to time based on a number of factors including our own financial strength performance prospects and operations as well as factors not under our control such as ratingagencyspecific criteria or frameworks for our industry or certain security types which are subject to revision from time to time and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally downgrades in our credit ratings may affect our borrowing costs our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and in turn our liquidity adversely a failure to maintain an acceptable credit rating also may preclude us from being competitive in certain products additionally our counterparties as well as our clients rely on our financial strength and stability and evaluate the risks of doing business with us if we experience diminished financial strength or stability actual or perceived a decline in our stock price or a reduced credit rating our counterparties may be less willing to enter into transactions secured or unsecured with us our clients may reduce or place limits on the level of services we provide them or seek other service providers or our prospective clients may select other service providers all of which may have other adverse effects on our business the risk that we may be perceived as less creditworthy relative to other market participants is higher in a market environment in which the consolidation and in some instances failure of financial institutions including major global financial institutions could result in a smaller number of larger counterparties and competitors if our counterparties perceive us to be a less viable counterparty our ability to enter into financial transactions on terms acceptable to us or our clients on our or our clients behalf will be compromised materially if our clients reduce their deposits with us or select other service providers for all or a portion of the services we provide to them our revenues will decrease accordingly our

our existing employees and continue to compensate our employees competitively competition for the best employees in most activities in which we engage can be intense and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain key personnel factors that affect our ability to attract and retain talented and diverse employees include our compensation and benefits programs our profitability and our reputation for rewarding and promoting qualified employees our ability to attract and retain key executives and other employees may be hindered as a result of existing and potential regulations applicable to incentive compensation and other aspects of our compensation programs these regulations may not apply to some of our competitors and to other institutions with which we compete for talent the unexpected loss of services of key personnel both in businesses and corporate functions could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills knowledge of our markets operations and clients years of industry experience and in some cases the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel similarly the loss of key employees either individually or as a group could affect our clients perception of our abilities adversely we are subject to intense competition in all aspects of our businesses which could have a

wellcapitalized and geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wide array of financial products and services at competitive prices in certain businesses such as foreign exchange trading electronic networks present a competitive challenge additionally technological advances and the growth of internetbased commerce have made it possible for other types of institutions to offer a variety of products and services competitive with certain areas of our business many of these nontraditional service providers have fewer regulatory constraints and some have lower cost structures

third parties as well as the personal use of social media by our employees and others may increase the risk of negative publicity including through the rapid dissemination of inaccurate misleading or false information which could harm our reputation or have other negative consequences we need to invest in innovation constantly and the inability or failure to do so may affect our businesses and earnings negatively our success in the competitive environment in which we operate requires consistent investment of capital and human resources in innovation particularly in light of the current

existing clients and includes investment in technological innovation as well effectively identifying gaps or weaknesses in our product offerings also is important to our success falling behind our competition in any of these areas could affect our business opportunities growth and earnings adversely there are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with innovation efforts including an increased risk that new and emerging technologies may expose us to increased cybersecurity and other information technology threats we must invest significant time and resources in developing and marketing new products and services and expected timetables for the introduction and development of new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not be met further our revenues and costs may fluctuate because new products and services generally require startup costs while corresponding revenues take time to develop or may not develop at all failure to understand or appreciate fully the risks associated with development or delivery of new product and service offerings will affect our businesses and earnings negatively the success of our innovation efforts depends in part on the successful implementation of new product and service initiatives not only must we keep pace with competitors in the development of these new offerings but we must accurately price them as well as existing products on a riskadjusted basis and deliver them to clients effectively our identification of risks arising from new products and services both in their design and implementation and effective responses to those identified risks including pricing is key to the success of our efforts at innovation and investment in new product and service offerings

or regulatory requirements our businesses or the financial markets or fail to enhance our risk framework to address those changes in a timely fashion if our risk framework is ineffective either because it fails to keep pace with changes in the financial markets legal and regulatory requirements our businesses our counterparties clients or service providers or for other reasons we could incur losses suffer reputational damage or find ourselves out of compliance with applicable regulatory or contractual mandates or expectations these risks are magnified as client requirements become more complex and as our increasingly global business requires endtoend management of operational and other processes across multiple time zones and many interrelated products and services we may take actions to maintain client satisfaction that result in losses or reduced earnings we may take action or incur expenses in order to maintain client satisfaction or preserve the usefulness of investments or investment vehicles we manage in light of changes in security ratings liquidity or valuation issues or other developments even though we are not required to do so by law or the terms of governing instruments the risk that we will decide to take actions to maintain client satisfaction that result in losses or reduced earnings is greater in periods when credit or equity markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile and liquidity in markets is disrupted other risks changes in tax laws and interpretations and tax challenges may affect our earnings negatively both us and nonus governments and tax authorities including states and municipalities from time to time issue new or modify existing tax laws and regulations these authorities may also issue new or modify

on the income of the corporations nonus branches changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made with respect to the tcja and changes to the competitive landscape in which we operate and other factors in the course of our business we are sometimes subject to challenges from us and nonus tax authorities including states and municipalities regarding the amount of taxes due these challenges
