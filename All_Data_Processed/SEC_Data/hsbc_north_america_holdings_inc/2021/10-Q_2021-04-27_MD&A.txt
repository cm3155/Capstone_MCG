and globally have been extreme and the duration of the pandemic and its ultimate repercussions continue to remain unclear unprecedented government economic intervention including additional government support enacted during the first quarter of has likely dampened the pandemics effects but at uncertain longterm cost however these government support measures combined with accelerated progress on vaccinations and the easing of restrictions by many states have helped speed the economic recovery along considerably us gross domestic product gdp is currently forecast to grow at an annual rate in excess of percent in the first quarter of while the us economy added over thousand jobs during the first quarter of and the total unemployment rate fell to percent at march as compared with percent at december in march the frb decided to hold shortterm interest rates steady at near zero and indicated it expects shortterm rates to remain low for some time the frb also announced that it will continue to increase its holdings of us treasury and us government agency mortgagebacked securities thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses although the us economy improved in the

income tax was income of million during the three months ended march compared with a loss of million during the three months ended march the increase in income loss before income tax during the three months ended march was due primarily to a lower provision for credit losses driven by improved economic conditions and lower operating expenses driven by the nonrecurrence of a million goodwill impairment charge recorded during the first quarter of and lower occupancy expense also contributing to the increase was higher net interest income our reported results in all periods were impacted by

libor transition regulators and central banks in various national jurisdictions continue to actively work to help transition from interbank offered rates ibors to acceptable alternative rates such as the secured overnight financing rate sofr recommended by the alternative reference rates committee convened by the frb we have a considerable number of contracts referencing ibors primarily us dollar usd libor such as loans derivatives and longterm debt in march the united kingdom uk financial conduct authority fca confirmed that all libor tenors will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative immediately after december in the case of the oneweek and twomonth usd libor tenors and immediately after june in the case of the remaining overnight onemonth threemonth sixmonth and twelvemonth usd libor tenors the extension of certain usd libor tenors until june will allow many legacy liborbased contracts to mature naturally and significantly aids in reducing the risks associated with transitioning legacy contracts onto replacement rates separately the international swaps and derivatives association isda has confirmed that the fallback spread adjustments to be used in its isda fallbacks have been fixed as of the date of the fca announcement as a result the isda fallbacks ie to the adjusted riskfree rate plus the fixed spread adjustment will automatically occur for outstanding derivative contracts that incorporate the isda fallback language or adhere to the isda fallback protocol generally when each libor tenor ceases or becomes nonrepresentative for all outstanding derivatives referenced to usd libor tenors the isda fallback will occur immediately after june these announcements provide clarity on the future terms of the many derivative contracts which now incorporate the isda fallbacks in addition during the first quarter of central clearing counterparties amended their rules to incorporate the new isda fallback language and adhere to the isda fallback protocol for cleared derivative contracts hsbc usa inc we continue to actively participate in hsbcs global transition program with the objective of facilitating an orderly transition of all products processes models and curves as well as all legacy liborbased contracts onto replacement rates in particular during the first quarter of we implemented the capabilities to offer sofrbased derivatives in our markets treasury function and sofrbased bilateral loans in our commercial banking business and continued to reduce our libor derivative exposures through the exit or transfer of certain derivative contracts as part of our restructuring plan the ability of husi and its clients to transition legacy contracts onto replacement rates is dependent on the availability and market liquidity of products that reference replacement rates including sofr and on our clients being ready and able to adapt their own processes and systems to accommodate the replacement products we continue to engage with industry participants the official sector and our clients to support an orderly transition and the mitigation of the risks resulting from the transition for further discussion of our libor transition program and the associated risks see executive overview in mda in our form 10k other covid19 related developments the covid19 pandemic has significantly disrupted economic activity in many countries including the united states and the us government has taken multiple actions to mitigate the magnitude and persistence of the effects of the covid19 pandemic the united states has been operating under a presidentially declared national emergency since march in march the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act was signed into law which provided financial assistance for businesses and individuals and targeted regulatory relief for financial institutions in december the consolidated appropriations act was signed into law which extended many of the cares act programs and provided additional financial assistance for businesses and individuals loan forbearance initiatives the cares act created a forbearance program for federallybacked mortgage loans and provided financial institutions with the option to temporarily suspend certain requirements under us gaap related to troubled debt restructurings tdr loans beginning march this tdr loan guidance can be applied until the earlier of january or days following the termination of the presidentially declared national emergency we elected to adopt the tdr loan guidance in the cares act and are not applying tdr loan classification to covid19 related loan modifications in the form of a longterm payment deferral for commercial loans all payment modifications including all payment deferrals granted to borrowers that were current less than days past due as of december which otherwise may have been reported as tdr loans the cares act also prohibits servicers of federallybacked mortgage loans from initiating any foreclosure action on any residential property that is not vacant or abandoned for a period of days this moratorium has been extended until june in addition to these federal measures some state governments have taken action to require forbearance with respect to certain loans and fees we are continuing to monitor federal state and international regulatory developments in relation to covid19 and their potential impact on our operations in federal banking regulators issued a revised interagency statement on loan modifications and the reporting for financial institutions working with customers affected by the covid19 pandemic interagency statement the interagency statement confirmed that covid19 related shortterm loan modifications eg payment deferrals of six months or less provided to borrowers that were current less than days past due at the time the relief was granted are not tdr loans borrowers that do not meet the criteria in the cares act or the interagency statement are assessed for tdr loan classification in accordance with our accounting policies through march these loans were not significant in addition under the interagency statement for covid19 related loan modifications in the form of a payment deferral the borrowers past due status will not be affected during the deferral period and if the loan was accruing at the time the relief was granted the loan will generally not be placed on nonaccrual status as long as the borrower utilizes a payment deferral of six months or less for consumer mortgage loans when a borrower utilizes a payment deferral of more than six months the loan will generally be placed on nonaccrual status and if the loan does not meet the criteria in the cares act assessed for tdr loan classification any accrued interest recorded on these loans is generally not reversed against income and will remain recorded as accrued interest receivable we have not modified our commercial loan nonaccrual policies as a result of this guidance hsbc usa inc we have implemented various loan modification payment deferral programs to provide borrowers relief from the economic impacts of the covid19 pandemic the following table summarizes information about loans under these programs as of march not included in the following table are loans that have exited the programs as well as other forms of relief that we have provided to commercial clients affected by the impact of covid19 such as covenant waivers and

least one payment was collected during the first quarter of total number of commercial loans is less than includes million of consumer mortgage loans where the borrowers were provided with extended payment deferral relief of more than six months at march due to our cares act election million of these loans were exempted from tdr assessment in addition million of these loans have been placed on nonaccrual status because the borrowers utilized a payment deferral of more than six months when the payment relief period ends borrowers have various options including repaying the deferred payments in full repaying the deferred payments over an installment period or moving the deferred payments to the end of the loan if a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty when the payment relief period ends they may enter into a modification program to reduce the interest rate and extend the term of the loan which would result in the loan being classified as a tdr loan as of march million and million of commercial and consumer loans respectively have exited a covid19 related payment deferral program of which nil and million respectively entered into a modification program upon exiting that resulted in the loans being classified as tdr loans of the commercial and consumer loans that have exited a covid19 related payment deferral program percent and percent respectively were current or less than days past due as of march paycheck protection program the cares act created a new loan guarantee program entitled the paycheck protection program ppp targeted to provide small businesses with support to cover payroll and certain other expenses loans made under the ppp are fully guaranteed by the small business administration sba whose guarantee is backed by the full faith and credit of the united states ppp covered loans also afford borrowers forgiveness up to the principal amount of the ppp covered loan plus accrued interest if the loan proceeds are used to retain workers and maintain payroll or to make certain mortgage interest lease and utility payments and certain other criteria are satisfied the sba will reimburse ppp lenders for any amount of a ppp covered loan that is forgiven and ppp lenders will not be held liable for any representations made by ppp borrowers in connection with their requests for loan forgiveness lenders receive predetermined fees for processing and servicing ppp loans in addition ppp loans are riskweighted at zero percent under the generallyapplicable standardized hsbc usa inc approach used to calculate riskweighted assets for

been no significant changes since december in the differences between us gaap and the group reporting basis impacting our results differences in reported profit before tax in the table above that were individually significant for the periods presented are explained below during the first quarter of expected credit losses were lower under us gaap than under the group reporting basis under the group reporting basis a majority of our loans are considered to be in stage which requires a 12month expected credit losses estimate while under us gaap such loans require a lifetime expected credit losses lifetime ecl estimate primarily as a result of the different requirements releases in credit reserves driven by improved economic conditions which resulted in improved economic forecasts used to calculate expected credit losses and improvements in credit conditions associated with certain clients were more pronounced under us gaap client paydowns also contributed to the higher releases in credit reserves under us gaap during the first quarter of expected credit losses were higher under us gaap than under the group reporting basis primarily as a result of the different requirements related to stage loans discussed above loss provisions driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the covid19 pandemic which resulted in a worsening of the economic forecasts used to calculate expected credit losses downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients and loan growth as clients drew on their available lines of credit were more pronounced under us gaap during the first quarter of goodwill impairment charges were lower under the group reporting basis than under us gaap under the group reporting basis goodwill was amortized until however goodwill was amortized under us gaap until which resulted in lower carrying amounts of goodwill and therefore lower impairment charges under the group reporting basis hsbc usa inc balance sheet review

purchased under agreements to resell balances may fluctuate from period to period depending upon our liquidity position at the time and our strategy for deploying liquidity shortterm investments increased compared with december due to an increase in overall liquidity as we raised funds in advance of their usage the increase in funds was driven by net sales paydowns and maturities of securities as well as higher deposits as our customers increased their demand and savings deposits in response to the economic uncertainty caused by the covid19 pandemic and the actions taken by the us government to provide financial support to households and businesses these increases were partially offset by repayments of precious metal trading liabilities and longterm debt hsbc usa inc loans

and december respectively see credit quality in this mda for a discussion of trends in our allowance for credit losses on loans commercial loans decreased compared with december due primarily to the impact of our efforts to improve returns through disciplined lending paydowns and lower demand from clients reflecting increased capital markets activity these decreases were partially offset by higher loans to affiliates and ppp loan originations the decline in commercial nonaffiliate loans was primarily in the diversified financial real estate energy and semiconductor industries partially offset by an increase in the banking industry consumer loans decreased modestly compared with december due primarily to paydowns in credit card receivables reflecting seasonality and lower origination

the change in the federal housing finance agencys house price index hpi at either a core based statistical area or state level the estimated value of the homes could differ from actual fair values due to changes in condition of the underlying property variations in housing price changes within metropolitan statistical areas and other factors as a result actual property values associated with loans that end in foreclosure may be significantly lower than the estimates used for purposes of this disclosure hsbc usa inc current estimated property values are calculated using the most current hpis

decrease in us treasury positions partially offset by an increase in equity positions trading security positions are held as economic hedges of interest rate credit and equity derivative products issued to clients of domestic and emerging markets balances of securities sold not yet purchased were lower compared with december driven by a decrease in short us treasury positions related to economic hedges of derivatives in the interest rate trading portfolio precious metals trading assets decreased compared with december due primarily to a decrease in our own silver inventory position partially offset by an increase in our own palladium inventory position payables for precious metals were lower compared with december reflecting a decrease in borrowing of gold inventory to support client activity levels precious metal positions may not represent our net underlying exposure as we may use derivatives contracts to reduce our risk associated with these positions the fair value of which would appear in derivatives in the table above derivative asset and liability balances both decreased compared with december mainly from market movements and reduced positions driven by the exit or transfer of certain derivative contracts as part of our restructuring plan market movements resulted in lower valuations of interest rate foreign exchange equity and credit derivatives market movements on commodity derivatives were mixed resulting in higher derivative asset valuations but lower derivative liability valuations securities securities include securities availableforsale and securities heldtomaturity net securities balances were lower compared with december driven by net sales paydowns and maturities as part of our continuing strategy to maximize returns while balancing the securities portfolio for risk management purposes as well as unfavorable market valuations due to increasing yields the decline in securities balances was primarily in us treasury us government agency mortgagebacked and foreign sovereign securities which was partially offset by net purchases of us government sponsored mortgagebacked securities all other assets all other assets includes among other items properties and equipment net and goodwill all other assets were flat compared with december as higher tax assets and higher outstanding clearing receivables from correspondent banks were largely offset by lower cash collateral posted during the third quarter of we completed a quantitative impairment test of goodwill and determined that the fair value of our commercial banking reporting unit exceeded its carrying value with its fair value being approximately percent of book value including allocated goodwill our fair value calculations are highly sensitive to certain assumptions and estimates used we will continue to monitor changes to our business forecasts as we continue to perform periodic analyses of the risks and strategies of our business and product offerings if deterioration in economic and credit conditions a change in the strategy or performance of our business or product offerings or an increase in the capital requirements of our business

increased compared with december as our customers increased their demand and savings deposits in response to the economic uncertainty caused by the covid19 pandemic and the actions taken by the us government to provide financial support to households and businesses also contributing to the increase was higher overall deposits from affiliates however a shift in mix resulted in an increase in deposits from bank affiliates partially offset by a decline in deposits from nonbank affiliates which drove the reduction in deposits from individuals partnerships and corporations the increase in deposits was partially offset by a decline in time deposits shortterm borrowings shortterm borrowings increased slightly compared with december reflecting higher shortterm borrowings from affiliates longterm debt longterm debt decreased compared with december as the impact of debt issuances including million of senior debt issued to hsbc north america during the first quarter of was more than

december respectively borrowings from the fhlb totaled million and million at march and december respectively interest taxes and other liabilities interest taxes and other liabilities were lower

represents the benefit associated with interest earning assets in excess of interest bearing liabilities increased percentages reflect growth in this excess or a higher cost of interest bearing liabilities while decreased percentages reflect a reduction in this excess or a lower cost of interest bearing liabilities net interest income increased during the three months ended march due primarily to lower interest expense from interest bearing liabilities driven by lower rates paid and a shift in mix to lower cost deposits the increase was partially offset by lower interest income from interest earning assets driven by lower yields on shortterm investments loans and securities as well as the unfavorable impact of lower average interest earning asset balances primarily commercial loans securities and trading securities shortterm investments interest income decreased during the three months ended march due to lower yields earned on these balances reflecting the impact of lower market rates partially offset by higher average balances trading securities interest income decreased during the three months ended march due to lower average balances and lower yields reflecting the impact of lower market rates the decrease in average balances was driven by declines in us treasury foreign sovereign and corporate bond positions partially offset by an increase in equity positions interest income associated with trading securities was partially offset within trading revenue by the performance of the associated derivatives as discussed further below securities interest income was lower during the three months ended march due to lower yields reflecting the impact of lower market rates and lower average balances lower average balances were driven by declines in us government agency mortgagebacked and us treasury securities partially offset by an increase in us government sponsored mortgagebacked securities hsbc usa inc commercial loans interest income was

of derivative contracts in a receivable position in the event the counterparties of such contracts fail to perform under the terms of those contracts in managing derivative credit risk both the current exposure which is the replacement cost of contracts on the measurement date as well as an estimate of the potential change in value of contracts over their remaining lives are considered counterparties to our derivative activities include financial institutions central clearing parties foreign and domestic government agencies corporations funds mutual funds hedge funds etc insurance companies and private clients as well as other hsbc entities these counterparties are subject to regular credit review by the credit risk management department to minimize credit risk we may enter into legally enforceable master netting agreements which reduce risk by permitting the closeout and netting of transactions with the same counterparty upon occurrence of certain events in addition we reduce credit risk by obtaining collateral from counterparties the determination of the need for and the levels of collateral will differ based on an assessment of the credit risk of the counterparty andor regulatory requirements the total risk in a derivative contract is a function of a number of variables such as volatility of interest rates currencies equity or corporate reference entity used as the basis for determining contract payments current market events or trends country risk maturity and liquidity of contracts creditworthiness of the counterparties in the transaction the existence of a master netting agreement among the counterparties and existence and value of collateral received from counterparties to secure exposures the table below presents total credit risk exposure calculated using the general riskbased capital rules of the basel iii standardized approach which includes the net positive marktomarket of the derivative contracts plus any adjusted potential future exposure as measured in reference to the notional amount the regulatory capital rules recognize that bilateral netting agreements reduce credit risk and therefore allow for reductions of riskweighted assets when netting requirements have been met and collateral exists as a result riskweighted amounts for regulatory capital purposes are a portion of the original gross exposures furthermore many contracts contain provisions that allow us to close out the transaction if the counterparty fails to post required collateral in addition many contracts give us the right to break the transactions earlier than the final maturity date as a result these contracts have potential future exposures that are often much smaller than the future exposures derived from the regulatory capital rules march

hsbc north america and depository institutions such as hsbc bank usa to temporarily exclude us treasury securities and deposits at federal reserve banks from the denominator of their slr the rules were designed to allow banking institutions to expand their balance sheets to accommodate increased customer deposits while continuing to provide credit to companies and households these changes took

operations we enter into credit derivatives and various offbalance sheet arrangements with affiliates and third parties these arrangements arise principally in connection with our lending and client intermediation activities and involve primarily extensions of credit and in certain cases guarantees as a financial services provider we routinely extend credit through loan commitments and lines and letters of credit and provide financial guarantees including derivative transactions having characteristics of a guarantee the contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent our maximum possible credit exposure in the event that a counterparty draws down the full commitment amount or we are required to fulfill our maximum obligation under a guarantee the following table provides maturity information related to our credit derivatives and offbalance sheet arrangements many of these commitments and guarantees expire unused or without default in addition implementation of our business strategy as described under the heading executive overview events in our form 10k will affect our contractual obligations over time including with respect to credit derivatives as a result we believe that the contractual amount is not representative of the actual future credit exposure or funding requirements balance at march one year or less over one through five years over five years

whereby we are contractually obligated to extend credit in the form of loans participations in loans lease financing receivables or similar transactions consumer commitments comprise certain unused mastercardvisa credit card lines where we have the right to change terms or conditions upon notification to the customer and commitments to extend credit secured by residential properties where we have the right to change terms or conditions for cause upon notification to the customer commercial commitments comprise primarily those related to secured and unsecured loans and lines of credit in addition to the above we have established and manage a number of constant net asset value cnav money market funds that invest in shorterdated highlyrated money market securities to provide investors with a highly liquid and secure investment these funds price the assets in their portfolio on an amortized cost basis which enables them to create and liquidate shares at a constant price the funds however are not permitted to price their portfolios at amortized cost if that amount varies by more than basis points from the portfolios market value in that case the fund would be required to price its portfolio at market value and consequently would no longer be able to create or liquidate shares at a constant price we do not consolidate the cnav funds because we do not absorb the majority of the expected future risk associated with the funds assets including interest rate liquidity credit and other relevant risks that are expected to affect the value of the assets fair value fair value hierarchy fair value measurement accounting principles establish a fair value hierarchy structure that prioritizes the inputs to determine the fair value of an asset or liability the fair value framework the fair value framework distinguishes between inputs that are based on observed market data and unobservable inputs that reflect market participants assumptions it emphasizes the use of valuation methodologies that maximize observable market inputs for financial hsbc usa inc instruments carried at fair value the best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an actively traded market level where the market for a financial instrument is not active valuation techniques are used the majority of our valuation techniques use market inputs that are either observable or indirectly derived from and corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the financial instrument level because level and level instruments are determined by observable inputs less judgment is applied in determining their fair values in the absence of observable market inputs the financial instrument is valued based on valuation techniques that feature one or more significant unobservable inputs level the determination of the level of fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement of an asset or a liability is classified often requires judgment and may change over time as market conditions evolve we consider the following factors in developing the fair value hierarchy whether the asset or liability is transacted in an active market with a quoted market price the level of bidask spreads a lack of pricing transparency due to among other things complexity of the product and market liquidity whether only a few transactions are observed over a significant period of time whether the pricing quotations differ substantially among independent pricing services whether inputs to the valuation techniques can be derived from or corroborated with market data and whether significant adjustments are made to the observed pricing information or model output to determine the fair value level inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that the reporting entity has the ability to access for identical assets or liabilities a financial instrument is classified as a level measurement if it is listed on an exchange or is an instrument actively traded in the overthecounter otc market where transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume we regard financial instruments such as debt securities equity securities and derivative contracts listed on the primary exchanges of a country to be actively traded nonexchangetraded instruments classified as level assets include securities issued by the us treasury tobeannounced securities noncallable securities issued by us government sponsored enterprises and certain foreign governmentbacked debt level inputs are those that are observable either directly or indirectly but do not qualify as level inputs we classify mortgage passthrough securities agency and certain nonagency mortgage collateralized obligations nonexchangetraded derivative contracts assetbacked securities obligations of us states and political subdivisions corporate debt securities certain foreign governmentbacked debt preferred securities securities purchased and sold under resale and repurchase agreements precious metals certain loans held for sale certain student loans held for investment residential mortgage loans whose carrying amount was reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral and real estate owned as level measurements where possible at least two quotations from independent sources are obtained based on transactions involving comparable assets and liabilities to validate the fair value of these instruments we have established a process to understand the methodologies and inputs used by the third party pricing services to ensure that pricing information meets the fair value objective and where appropriate this pricing data is backtested to market trade executions where significant differences arise among the independent pricing quotes and the internally determined fair value we investigate and reconcile the differences if the investigation results in a significant adjustment to the fair value the instrument will be classified as level within the fair value hierarchy in general we have observed that there is a correlation between the credit standing and the market liquidity of a nonderivative instrument level derivative instruments are generally valued based on discounted future cash flows or an option pricing model adjusted for counterparty credit risk and market liquidity the fair value of certain derivative products is determined using valuation techniques based on inputs derived from observable indices traded in the otc market appropriate control processes and procedures have been applied to ensure that the derived inputs are applied to value only those instruments that share similar risks to the relevant benchmark indices and therefore demonstrate a similar response to market factors level inputs are unobservable estimates that management expects market participants would use to determine the fair value of the asset or liability that is level inputs incorporate market participants assumptions about risk and the risk premium required by market participants in order to bear that risk we develop level inputs based on the best information available in the circumstances at march and december our level measurements included the following certain structured deposits and structured notes for which the embedded credit foreign exchange or equity derivatives have significant unobservable inputs eg volatility or default correlations assetbacked credit default swaps with certain inputs which are unobservable certain assetbacked securities individually assessed commercial loans mortgage servicing rights derivatives referenced to illiquid assets of less desirable credit quality and swap agreements entered into in conjunction with the sales of visa class b shares for which the fair value is dependent upon the final resolution of the related litigation see note fair value measurements in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on level inputs hsbc usa inc level measurements the following table provides information about level assetsliabilities in relation to total assetsliabilities measured at fair value at march and december march december  are in millions level assets total assets measured at fair value level liabilities total liabilities measured at fair value level assets as a percent of total assets measured at fair value level liabilities as a percent of total liabilities measured at fair value presented without netting which allows the offsetting of amounts relating to certain contracts if certain conditions are met includes million of recurring level assets and million of nonrecurring level assets at march includes million of recurring level assets and million of nonrecurring level assets at december includes million of assets measured on a recurring basis and million of assets measured on a nonrecurring basis at march includes million of assets measured on a recurring basis and million of assets measured on a nonrecurring basis at december significant changes in fair value for level assets and liabilities see note fair value measurements in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information on additions to and transfers into out of level measurements during the three months ended march and as well as for further details including the classification hierarchy associated with assets and liabilities measured at fair value effect of changes in significant unobservable inputs the fair value of certain financial instruments is measured using valuation techniques that incorporate pricing assumptions not supported by derived from or corroborated by observable market data the resultant fair value measurements are dependent on unobservable input parameters which can be selected from a range of estimates and may be interdependent changes in one or more of the significant unobservable input parameters may change the fair value measurements of these financial instruments for the purpose of preparing the financial statements the final valuation inputs selected are based on managements best judgment that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing similar assets or liabilities the unobservable input parameters selected are subject to the internal valuation control processes and procedures when we perform a test of all the significant input parameters to the extreme values within the range at the same time it could result in an increase of the overall fair value measurement of approximately million or a decrease of the overall fair value measurement of approximately million at march the effect of changes in significant unobservable input parameters are primarily driven by the uncertainty in determining the fair value of credit derivatives executed against certain insurers and certain dealcontingent forward starting interest rate derivatives risk management overview managing risk effectively is fundamental to the delivery of our strategic priorities we use a comprehensive risk management framework across the organization and across all risk types underpinned by our risk culture this framework fosters continuous monitoring promotes risk awareness and encourages sound operational and strategic decisionmaking it also ensures a consistent approach to identifying assessing managing and reporting the risks we accept and incur in our activities our board of directors has the ultimate responsibility for effective management of risk it is advised on risk matters by the risk committee and the compliance and conduct committee of the board of directors in particular the risk committee of the board of directors advises the board of directors on risk appetite and its alignment with our strategy risk governance and internal controls as well as highlevel risk related matters robust risk governance and accountability are embedded throughout our business through an established framework that helps to ensure appropriate oversight of and accountability for the effective management of risk our material risks the principal risks associated with our operations include the following credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract treasury risk is the risk of having insufficient capital liquidity or funding resources to meet financial obligations and satisfy regulatory requirements including pension risk treasury risk also includes the risk to our earnings due to changes in market interest rates hsbc usa inc market risk is the risk that movements in market factors such as foreign exchange rates interest rates credit spreads equity prices and commodity prices will reduce our income or the value of our portfolios resilience risk is the risk that we are unable to provide critical services to our customers affiliates and counterparties as a result of sustained and significant operational disruption regulatory compliance risk is the risk that we fail to observe the letter and spirit of relevant laws codes rules regulations and standards of good market practice which as a consequence incur fines and penalties and suffer damage to our business financial crime risk is the risk that we knowingly or unknowingly help parties to commit or to further potentially illegal activity including money laundering fraud bribery and corruption tax evasion sanctions breaches and terrorist and proliferation financing strategic risk is the risk that the business will fail to identify execute and react appropriately to opportunities andor threats arising from changes in the market some of which may emerge over a number of years such as changing economic and political circumstances customer requirements demographic trends regulatory developments or competitor action and model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from business decisions informed by models which can be exacerbated by errors in methodology design or the way they are used in the course of our regular risk management activities we use models to help quantify the risk we are taking we believe that the assumptions used in these models are reasonable within the parameters for which the models have been built and calibrated to operate but events may unfold differently than what is assumed in the models consequently actual results may differ significantly from model projections the severe projections of macroeconomic variables during the current covid19 pandemic represent events outside the parameters for which the models have been built as a result adjustments to model outputs to reflect consideration of management judgment are used with stringent governance in place to ensure appropriate results where models do not require adjustments enhanced model monitoring confirms models are performing as intended see risk management in mda in our form 10k for a more complete discussion of the objectives of our risk management

shortterm liquidity measure to ensure banks have sufficient high quality liquid assets hqla to cover net stressed cash outflows over the next days at both march and december hsbc usas lcr exceeded percent a lcr of percent or higher reflects an unencumbered hqla balance that is equal to or exceeds liquidity needs for a calendar day liquidity stress scenario hqla consists of cash or assets that can be converted into cash at little or no loss of value in private markets hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa are also subject to the us lcr rule and are required to report their lcr to us regulators on a daily basis under the tailoring rules an percent lcr requirement applies to category iii firms with weighted shortterm wholesale funding under billion including hsbc north america and their depository institution subsidiaries such as hsbc bank usa from to percent beginning january as a result under the us lcr rule a lcr of percent or higher reflects an unencumbered hqla balance that is equal to or exceeds percent of a category iii firms hsbc usa inc liquidity needs for a calendar day liquidity stress scenario during the three months ended march hsbc bank usas lcr under the us lcr rule remained above the percent minimum requirement the uk calibration of the basel committee based net stable funding ratio nsfr which is a longer term liquidity measure with a 12month time horizon to ensure a sustainable maturity structure of assets and liabilities is still pending therefore our calculation of nsfr is based on our current interpretation and understanding of the basel committee nsfr guidance which may differ in future periods depending on completion of the uk calibration the uk nsfr rules are expected to become effective in january at both march and december hsbc usas estimated nsfr exceeded percent a nsfr of percent or more reflects an available stable funding balance from liabilities and capital over the next months that is equal to or exceeds the required amount of funding for assets and offbalance sheet exposures in october us regulators issued a final rule to implement the nsfr in the united states applicable to certain large banking organizations including hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa that will take effect july consistent with the tailoring rules an percent nsfr requirement will apply to category iii firms with weighted shortterm wholesale funding under billion including hsbc north america and their depository institution subsidiaries such as hsbc bank usa when the final rule becomes effective july as a result under the us

hsbc usa inc economic value of equity eve eve represents the present value of the banking book cash flows that could be provided to our equity holder under a managed runoff scenario an eve sensitivity represents the change in eve due to a defined movement in interest rates we manage to an immediate parallel upward shock of basis points and an immediate parallel downward shock of basis points to the market implied interest rates at both march and december our eve remained within risk appetite for the up and down basis point interest rate shock scenarios net interest income simulation modeling techniques we utilize simulation modeling to monitor a number of interest rate scenarios for their impact on projected net interest income these techniques simulate the impact on projected net interest income under various scenarios such as rate shock scenarios which assume immediate market rate movements by basis points as well as scenarios in which rates gradually rise or fall by basis points over a twelve month period in the gradual scenarios percent of the interest rate movement occurs at the beginning of each quarter the following table reflects the impact on our projected net interest income of the scenarios utilized by these modeling techniques march december amount amount dollars are in millions estimated increase decrease in projected net interest income reflects projected rate movements on april and january respectively resulting from a gradual basis point increase in the yield curve resulting from a gradual basis point decrease in the yield curve other significant scenarios monitored reflects projected rate movements on april and january respectively resulting from an immediate basis point increase in the yield curve resulting from an immediate basis point decrease in the yield curve the projections do not take into consideration possible complicating factors such as the effect of changes in interest rates on the credit quality size and composition of the balance sheet therefore although this provides a reasonable estimate of interest rate sensitivity actual results will differ from these estimates possibly by significant amounts market risk management exposure to market risk is separated into two portfolios trading portfolios comprise positions arising from marketmaking and warehousing of clientderived positions nontrading portfolios comprise positions that primarily arise from the interest rate management of our retail and commercial banking assets and liabilities and financial investments classified as availableforsale and heldtomaturity we apply similar risk management policies and measurement techniques to both trading and nontrading portfolios our objective is to manage and control market risk exposures to optimize return on risk while maintaining a market profile consistent with our established risk appetite see risk management in mda in our form 10k for a more complete discussion of our approach to market risk value at risk var var is a technique for estimating potential losses on risk positions as a result of movements in market rates and prices over a specified time horizon and to a given level of confidence the use of var is integrated into market risk management and calculated for all trading positions regardless of how we capitalize them in addition we calculate var for nontrading portfolios to have a complete picture of risk var measures are calculated to a percent confidence level and use a oneday holding period trading portfolios trading var generates primarily from the markets and securities services unit of our gbm business segment portfolios comprise mainly foreign exchange products interest rate swaps credit default swaps and precious metals ie gold silver platinum in both north america and emerging markets hsbc usa inc the following graph summarizes daily var for our trading portfolios at a percent confidence level in millions the following table summarizes our trading var for the three months ended march and at december foreign exchange and commodity interest rate credit spread portfolio diversification total in millions at march three months ended march average maximum minimum at december portfolio diversification is the market risk dispersion effect of holding a portfolio containing different risk types it represents the reduction in unsystematic market risk that occurs when combining a number of different risk types for example foreign exchange interest rate and credit spread together in one portfolio it is measured as the difference between the sum of the var by individual risk type and the combined total var a negative number represents the benefit of portfolio diversification as the maximum and minimum occur on different days for different risk types it is not meaningful to calculate a portfolio diversification benefit for these measures the total var is nonadditive across risk types due to diversification effects for presentation purposes portfolio diversification of the var for trading portfolios includes varbased risknotinvar backtesting we routinely validate the accuracy of our var models by backtesting them against hypothetical profit and loss that excludes nonmodeled items such as fees commissions and revenues of intraday transactions from the actual reported profit and loss we would expect under stable market conditions to see two or three losses in excess of var at the percent confidence level over a oneyear period however in periods of unstable market conditions we could see an increase in the number of backtesting exceptions during the first quarter of we experienced no loss backtesting exceptions nontrading portfolios nontrading var predominantly relates to markets treasury and represents the potential negative changes in the investment portfolio market value which includes availableforsale and heldtomaturity assets and associated hedges our investment portfolio holdings comprise mainly us treasury us government agency mortgagebacked and us government sponsored mortgagebacked securities our nontrading var exposure is driven by interest rates and agency spread volatility hsbc usa inc the following table summarizes our nontrading var for the three months ended march and at december interest rate credit spread portfolio diversification total in millions at march three months ended march average maximum minimum at december refer to the trading var table above for additional information non trading var was higher at march as compared with december due primarily to an increase in volatility of interest rates and spread volatility on us treasury and us government agency mortgagebacked securities nontrading var also includes the interest rate risk of nontrading financial assets and liabilities held by the global businesses and transfer priced into markets treasury which has the mandate to centrally manage and hedge it see treasury risk management

bank secrecy actantimoney laundering compliance officer served as the principal financial crime governance forum responsible for the management of financial crime risk as a reflection of the growing maturity and effectiveness of financial crime risk management the functions of the fcrmc were integrated into the risk management meeting rmm during the first quarter of with this change the rmm now oversees the risk management of both regulatory compliance and financial crime there have been no other material changes to our approach to financial crime risk management since december hsbc usa inc
