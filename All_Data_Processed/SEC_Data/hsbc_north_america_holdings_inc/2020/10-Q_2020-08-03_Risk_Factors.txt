to the sec could affect our business or results the readers should not consider any description of such factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that we may face risks relating to the impact of covid19 the covid19 pandemic has had and continues to have a material impact on businesses around the world and the economic environments in which they operate in march the united states declared a federal state of emergency in response to the covid19 pandemic which continues to spread throughout the united states the outbreak of this virus has disrupted global financial markets and negatively affected supply and demand across a broad range of industries there are a number of factors associated with the outbreak and its impact on global economies including the united states that have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on among other things the profitability capital and liquidity of financial institutions such as husi the circumstances around this pandemic are evolving and will continue to impact our business in future periods the covid19 pandemic has caused disruption to our customers suppliers and staff a number of states in which we operate have implemented restrictions on the movement of their respective populations with a resultant significant impact on economic activity in those states the pandemic resulted in sheltering in place requirements in many states and municipalities and the temporary closure of many businesses which only recently have begun to ease as governments have started to lift restrictions as a result the demand for our products and services has been and may continue to be significantly impacted and could vary by region or industry sector furthermore it is unclear how the macroeconomic business environment or societal norms may be impacted after the pandemic the postcovid19 environment may undergo unexpected developments or changes in the financial markets hsbc usa inc fiscal tax and regulatory environments as well as customer and corporate client behavior which could have an adverse impact on our business in the united states the federal government has taken action to provide financial support to parts of the economy most impacted by the covid19 pandemic the details of how these actions will impact our customers and therefore the impact on husi continues to remain uncertain furthermore it is unclear how these actions will ultimately impact the future economic environment including inflation interest rates and foreign exchange and our business the actions taken by the us government and the frb may indicate a view on the potential severity of a downturn and post recovery environment which from a commercial regulatory and risk perspective could be significantly different to past crises and persist for a prolonged period an immediate financial impact in has been higher lifetime ecl driven by a worsening in the economic scenarios used to calculate ecl as well as higher provisions for risk factors associated with large loan exposures downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients and loan growth as clients drew on their available lines of credit see note allowance for credit losses in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion in addition we have provided temporary payment relief to borrowers who are experiencing shortterm financial problems as a result of covid19 a risk exists that these shortterm financial problems may become longterm increasing our risk of credit losses unprecedented movement in economic and market drivers related to the covid19 pandemic dramatically impact the performance of financial models including retail and wholesale credit loss models capital models traded risk models and models used in the assetliability management process this has required additional monitoring and more frequent testing of models particularly for credit loss models it also has resulted in the use of mitigants for model limitations such as adjustments to model outputs to reflect consideration of management judgment the performance and usage of models has been and will continue to be impacted significantly by the consequences of the covid19 pandemic while it is too early to be entirely certain of the magnitude of change required for our models it is likely that capital credit risk and other models will need to be recalibrated or replaced the effectiveness of our models will depend in large part on the depth and length of the economic downturn the pandemic has led to a weakening in gross domestic product and significantly higher unemployment in the united states which officially entered recession in the second quarter of in addition as a result of deteriorating economic conditions we performed an interim goodwill impairment test as of march which resulted in the impairment of the goodwill previously allocated to our rbwm and pb reporting units this matter has also resulted in valuation losses associated with certain financial instruments due to market volatility which have largely recovered during the second quarter see managements discussion and analysis of financial position and results of operations additionally in april fitch changed the rating outlook for both hsbc usa and hsbc bank usa to negative from stable and in may standard poors downgraded the longterm and shortterm issuer credit ratings of hsbc usa and hsbc bank usa by one notch following similar ratings actions for hsbc these change reflect the economic disruption driven by the covid19 pandemic with standard poors also noting the hsbc groups restructuring plan see managements discussion and analysis of financial position and results of operations risk management the pandemic may not be fully contained until a vaccine andor widely accepted treatment becomes available which might not occur for an extended period of time should the current economic conditions persist or deteriorate further we expect that this environment will continue to adversely impact our business which could include but not be limited to further impacts on our income due to lower lending and transaction volumes and lower wealth management revenue due to equity markets volatility and weakness as well as additional credit losses other potential risks include the impact of postponed health screenings on the wellbeing of our employees credit rating migration which could negatively impact our riskweighted assets and capital position and potential liquidity stress due among other factors to increased customer drawdowns notwithstanding the significant initiatives that the us government and the frb have put in place to support funding and liquidity additionally interest rates have been reduced since the start of the covid19 pandemic which has and may continue to compress our margins and reduce our net interest income further while we have continued to progress our program for transitioning away from interbank offered rates including libor the covid19 pandemic is affecting our progress as well as the progress of other market participants see managements discussion and analysis of financial position and results of operations executive overview central bank and government actions and support measures taken in response to the covid19 pandemic may create restrictions in relation to capital these may limit managements flexibility in managing the business and taking action in relation to capital distribution and capital

its stress capital buffer in addition the frb has also announced that each ccar firm including hsbc north america must resubmit its capital plan later this year based on additional economic scenarios provided by the frb it is unclear if the frb will conduct further stress tests in hsbc usa inc connection with its review of ccar firms resubmitted capital plans or if the frb would recalculate the scb applicable to ccar firms based on such stress tests in addition federal and state legislative and regulatory developments in relation to covid19 have impacted and may continue to impact our business and operations by for example requiring forbearance on loans suspensions of foreclosure sales and imposing restrictions on our ability to charge certain fees our participation in these and other measures taken by governments and regulatory authorities could result in reputational harm and has resulted in and may continue to result in litigation including class actions or regulatory and government actions and proceedings such actions may result in judgments settlements penalties and fines adverse to husi late in the second quarter of we decided to lift the pause we had put in place in march on the staff reductions relating to our restructuring plan as covid19 restrictions have begun to ease and some businesses began to reopen our restructuring plan is moving forward as planned including consolidation of our retail branch network and wholesale and retail middle and back office functions each under a single operations structure and the creation of our wealth and personal banking business which was completed in the second quarter while we remain committed to our multiyear strategic plan to reprofile our business the timing of the strategic actions as outlined in our
