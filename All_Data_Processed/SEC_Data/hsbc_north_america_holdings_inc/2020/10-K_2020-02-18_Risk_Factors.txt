item risk factors table start table end the following discussion provides a description of the most significant risk factors that could affect our businesses results of operations and financial condition and could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in public statements or documents some of these risk factors are inherent in the financial services industry and others are more specific to our own businesses there are also other factors besides those discussed below or elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k that could affect our businesses results of operations and financial condition and therefore the risk factors below should not be considered a complete list of all potential risks that we may face macroeconomic risk market and economic conditions will continue to affect our businesses results of operations and financial condition our business and earnings are affected by general business economic and market conditions in the united states and abroad there can be no assurance that the global economy as a whole will continue to grow given our concentration of business activities in the united states we are particularly exposed to downturns in the economy including housing high unemployment the availability of credit and liquidity and reduced economic growth while the us economy continued to grow during the slowing of economic growth both in the united states and abroad has created global uncertainty about the future economic environment general business economic and market conditions that could continue to affect us include table start level of economic growth including the pace and magnitude of such growth table endtable start pressure on and changes in consumer confidence spending and behavior table endtable start fiscal policy table endtable start volatility in energy prices including oil and gas prices table endtable start volatility in credit markets table endtable start unemployment levels table endtable start

endtable start increases in interest rates which may lead to increased delinquencies and loan impairment charges table endtable start availability of liquidity table endtable start availability of credit and table endtable start new laws regulations or regulatory and law enforcement initiatives table end although the us economy in general continued to grow in if businesses were to become cautious to hire layoff employees or reduce hours for employees losses could be significant in all types of our consumer loans due to decreased consumer income in addition ongoing domestic and global policy issues such as trade disputes and the decision by the uk to exit the eu and the implications of those events will continue to impact the capital markets and trade as well as corporate earnings which impacts our commercial loan performance the sustainability of economic growth will be determined by numerous variables including consumer sentiment energy prices credit market volatility employment levels and housing market conditions which will impact corporate earnings and the capital markets in the event economic conditions begin to decline and lead to a recession there would be a significant negative impact on delinquencies chargeoffs and losses in all loan portfolios with a corresponding impact on our results of operations since the beginning of january the coronavirus outbreak has caused disruption for hsbc group particularly in china and hong kong it remains unclear how this will evolve in and we continue to monitor the situation closely at this time given our very limited direct credit and operational exposure to affected regions we believe that the primary risk that the current coronavirus poses to us relates to the potential disruption of the global economy supply chains and transportation we do not currently believe those potential disruptions would have a material effect on us spread of the coronavirus in particular to the table start hsbc usa inc table end united states could exacerbate its effect on us which could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and results of operations a deterioration in business and economic conditions which may erode consumer and investor confidence levels or increased volatility of financial markets also could adversely affect financial results for our feebased businesses including our financial planning products and services macroprudential regulatory and legal risks to our business model federal state local and other similar international measures to regulate the financial industry may significantly impact our operations we operate in a highly regulated environment changes in federal state and local laws and regulations affecting banking derivatives capital liquidity consumer credit bankruptcy privacy consumer protection or other matters could materially impact our operations and performance attempts by local state and federal regulatory agencies to address perceived problems with the mortgage lending and credit card industries could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways including limiting the types of products we can offer how these products may be originated the fees and charges that may be applied to accounts and how accounts may be collected or security interests enforced any one or more of these effects could negatively impact our results there is also significant focus on loss mitigation and foreclosure activity for real estate loans we cannot fully anticipate the response by national regulatory agencies state attorneys general or certain legislators nor can we anticipate whether significant changes to our operations and practices will be required as a result the doddfrank act established the cfpb which has broad authority to regulate providers of credit payment and other consumer financial products and services in addition provisions of the doddfrank act may narrow the scope of federal preemption of state consumer laws and expand the authority of state attorneys general to bring actions to enforce federal consumer protection legislation as a result of the doddfrank acts potential expansion of the authority of state attorneys general to bring actions to enforce federal consumer protection legislation we could potentially be subject to additional state lawsuits and enforcement actions thereby further increasing our legal and compliance costs under the doddfrank act certain of our affiliates and subsidiaries including hsbc bank usa have registered as swap dealers and are subject to extensive oversight by the cftc regulation of swap dealers by the cftc imposes numerous corporate governance business conduct capital margin reporting clearing execution and other regulatory requirements on hsbc bank usa additionally certain of our affiliates and subsidiaries including hsbc bank usa may in the future be required to register as securitybased swap dealers and become subject to extensive oversight by the sec including the imposition of parallel corporate governance business conduct reporting and other regulatory requirements for securitybased swaps imposition of these requirements may adversely affect our derivatives business and make us less competitive or make certain derivative products less profitable to undertake although many significant regulations applicable to swap dealers are already in effect and have imposed significant costs on our derivatives business we continue to assess current regulation proposed or expected changes to existing requirements and the potential impact of future securitybased swap requirements the volcker rule limits the ability of banking entities such as husi to sponsor or invest in certain private equity or hedge funds or engage in certain types of proprietary trading see part i regulation and competition the volcker rule in this form 10k in september and october us regulatory agencies finalized amendments that modify numerous aspects of the volcker rule given that hsbc north america has more than billion in trading assets and liabilities it remains subject to the highest expectations under the volcker rule while the recent amendments are intended to streamline the existing requirements and result in a more simplified revised final rule such changes to the proprietary trading provisions of the volcker rule may result in increased compliance and operational costs especially in connection with any modifications to the quantitative metrics reporting requirements these amendments to the volcker rule became effective january with compliance required by january we continue to assess the impact of the amendments on our operations on january the agencies proposed further amendments to the volcker rules funds provisions which would if adopted clarify key definitions and add new and modify certain existing exclusions from the definition of covered fund the proposal is currently open for comment and the timeline for finalization remains uncertain our parent hsbc north america is subject to assessment by the frb as part of the ccar and dfast programs which includes annual supervisory stress tests conducted by the frb and company run stress tests that hsbc north america must conduct annually with disclosure of the companyrun stress tests every other year ccar is an annual exercise prescribed by the frb to ensure that institutions have forwardlooking capital planning processes that account for their risks and sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial stress as part of this exercise the frb evaluates hsbc north americas capital plan including any plans to make capital distributions such as dividend payments against the minimum regulatory capital requirements we cannot be certain that the frb will not object to our or future capital plans if the frb does object to our capital plan we may be prohibited from taking capital actions such as paying or increasing dividends or repurchasing securities table start hsbc usa inc table end additionally as the ccar and dfast results are released publicly an objection to the capital plan may have a material adverse impact on our reputation see part i regulation and competition capital planning and stress testing in this form 10k see also our reputation has a direct impact on our financial results and ongoing operations below the total impact of the doddfrank act and related legislative and regulatory initiatives cannot be fully assessed without taking into consideration how nonus policymakers and regulators may respond through the promulgation of new regulations and revisions to existing regulations and how the cumulative effects of both us and nonus laws and regulations will affect our businesses and operations additional legislative or regulatory actions in the united states the eu and in other countries could result in a significant loss of revenue limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in which we might otherwise consider engaging affect the value of assets that we hold require us to increase our prices and therefore reduce demand for our products impose additional costs on us or otherwise adversely affect our businesses accordingly any such new or additional legislation or regulations could have an adverse effect on our businesses results of operations or financial condition regulators in the eu and in the united kingdom are in the midst of negotiating and implementing farreaching programs of financial regulatory reform key areas in which reforms are in progress or under consideration include enhanced capital leverage and liquidity requirements changes in compensation practices including tax levies separation of retail and wholesale banking the recovery and resolution of eu financial institutions and measures to address systemic risk furthermore certain large gsibs including hsbc have in recent years become subject to capital surcharges and other enhanced prudential requirements in the fsb identified hsbc as one of two gsibs that will remain subject to a percent surcharge the frbs rules implementing the gsib surcharge in the united states would not impose additional capital requirements on us because the us gsib surcharge will only apply to the eight largest us banking organizations our ultimate parent hsbc is subject to the fsbs tlac requirements for gsibs in the united kingdom the tlac standard also permits authorities in host jurisdictions to require internal tlac to be issued by local entities to either parent entities or third parties the purpose of the tlac standard is to ensure that gsibs have sufficient lossabsorbing and recapitalization capacity available to implement an orderly resolution with continuity of critical functions and minimal impact on financial stability and to ensure cooperation between home and host authorities during resolution the tlac standard called for all gsibs to be subject to tlac requirements effective january and to be fully phased in by january the frbs rules implementing the fsbs tlac standard in the united states require the us ihcs of nonus gsibs including hsbc north america to maintain minimum amounts of tlac and a related tlac buffer the us tlac rules also include clean holding company requirements that limit the types of financial transactions that hsbc north america may engage in to support compliance with the tlac rules hsbc north america in issued longterm debt and may be required to issue additional longterm debt in future periods see part i regulation and competition capital planning and stress testing in this form 10k the delivery of our priorities is subject to execution risk effective management of transformation projects is required to effectively deliver our strategic priorities involving delivering both on externally driven programs regulatory requirements and benchmark rate transition as well as key business initiatives to deliver revenue growth product enhancement and operational efficiency outcomes see failure to effectively implement our business strategies may adversely affect our financial performance regulatory requests legal matters and business initiatives all require a significant amount of time and resources to implement the magnitude complexity and at times concurrent demands of projects has resulted in heightened execution risk organizational change and external factors including the challenging macroeconomic environment and the extent and pace of regulatory change also contribute to execution risk these factors could adversely affect the successful delivery of our priorities uncertainty surrounding the potential legal regulatory and policy changes by the current administration in the us the administration that may directly impact financial institutions and the global economy the current administration has indicated that it would like to see further changes made to certain financial reform regulations which has resulted in regulatory uncertainty we continue to assess the potential impact this may have on financial and economic markets and on our business changes in federal policy and regulatory agencies have occurred and are expected to continue to occur over time through policy and personnel changes which could lead to additional changes involving the level of oversight and focus on the financial services industry the nature timing and economic and political effects of potential future changes to the current legal and regulatory framework affecting financial institutions remain highly uncertain in addition the administration has indicated that it would like to amend us immigration policies if immigration policies were to restrict or otherwise make it more difficult for qualified employees to work in or transfer among jurisdictions in which we or other members of the hsbc group have operations or conduct business we could be adversely affected while regulatory changes to date have not had a significant impact to our business it is unclear what additional laws regulations and policies may change and whether future changes or uncertainty surrounding future changes will adversely affect our operating environment and therefore our results of operations and financial condition lawsuits and regulatory investigations and proceedings may continue and increase in the current economic and regulatory environment in the ordinary course of business hsbc usa and its affiliates are routinely named as defendants in or as parties to various legal actions and proceedings relating to our current andor former operations and are subject to governmental and regulatory examinations informationgathering requests investigations and formal and informal proceedings as described in note table start hsbc usa inc table end litigation and regulatory matters in the accompanying consolidated financial statements certain of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties remediation payments injunctions and other relief there is no certainty that the litigation will decrease in the near future especially in the event of a resurgent recession or additional regulatory and law enforcement investigations and proceedings by federal and state governmental agencies financial service providers are at risk of regulatory sanctions or fines related to conduct of business and financial crime the incidence of regulatory proceedings and other adversarial proceedings against financial service firms is increasing with a corresponding increase also in civil litigation arising from or relating to issues which are subject to regulatory investigations sanctions or fines there may be additional regulatory investigations and reviews conducted by banking and other regulators including the cfpb cftc state attorneys general or state regulatory and law enforcement agencies that if determined adversely may result in judgments settlements substantial fines penalties remediation payments or other results including additional compliance requirements which could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition or results of operations or cause serious reputational harm in addition hsbcs extensive global operations increase our compliance and regulatory risks and costs for example operations in emerging markets including facilitating crossborder transactions on behalf of its clients subjects us to higher compliance risks under us regulations primarily focused on various aspects of global corporate activities including aml laws and regulations the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and economic sanctions programs administered by the office of foreign assets control ofac these risks can be more acute in less developed markets and thus require substantial investment in compliance infrastructure or could result in a reduction in certain of our affiliates business activities criminal prosecutions of financial institutions for among other alleged conduct breaches of aml laws and regulations the fcpa economic sanctions programs antitrust violations market manipulation aiding and abetting tax evasion and providing unlicensed crossborder banking services have become more commonplace and may increase in frequency due to increased media attention and higher expectations from prosecutors and the public any such prosecution or investigation of or legal proceeding or regulatory action brought against hsbc or one or more of its subsidiaries could result in substantial fines penalties andor forfeitures and could have a material adverse effect on our results business and prospects including the potential loss of key licenses requirement to exit certain businesses and withdrawal of funding from depositors and other stakeholders for example hsbc continues to be subject to a january deferred prosecution agreement with the doj arising from its investigation into hsbcs historical foreign exchange activities the fx dpa potential consequences of breaching the fx dpa could include the imposition of additional terms and conditions on hsbc an extension of the agreement or the criminal prosecution of hsbc which could in turn entail further financial penalties and collateral consequences and could negatively impact hsbc subsidiaries including hsbc bank usa we establish reserves for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated notwithstanding we may incur legal costs for a matter even if we have not established a reserve in addition the actual cost of resolving a legal claim may be substantially higher than any amounts reserved for that matter it is inherently difficult to predict the outcome of many of the legal regulatory and other adversarial proceedings involving our businesses particularly those cases in which matters are brought on behalf of various classes of claimants those which seek unspecified damages or those which involve novel legal claims the ultimate resolution of a pending legal proceeding depending on the remedy sought and granted could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition third parties may use us as a conduit for illegal activities without our knowledge which could have a material adverse effect on us we are required to comply with applicable aml laws and regulations the fcpa and economic sanctions programs administered by ofac and we have adopted various policies and procedures including know your customer procedures and other internal controls that are reasonably designed to achieve compliance with applicable aml antibriberyanticorruption and economic sanctions requirements these policies and procedures are aimed at preventing the use of our products and services for the purpose of committing or concealing financial crime in relevant situations and where permitted by regulation we may rely upon certain counterparties including our affiliates to maintain and properly apply their own appropriate policies and procedures relating to financial crime compliance including aml antibriberyanticorruption and economic sanctions a major focus of us government policy relating to financial institutions in recent years has been combating financial crime activity including money laundering bribery and corruption and enforcing compliance with economic sanctions a program consisting of policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to achieve compliance with financial crime laws may not always prevent third parties from using us and our relevant counterparties as a conduit for money laundering including illegal cash operations without our knowledge and that of our relevant counterparties or committing acts of bribery or violations of economic sanctions through us as discussed above becoming a party to violations of financial crime laws or regulations or accusations of being associated with such activity could damage our reputation andor lead to fines sanctions andor legal enforcement any one of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and results of operations regulatory requirements in the us and in nonus jurisdictions to facilitate the future orderly resolution of large financial institutions could negatively impact our business structures activities and practices the doddfrank act requires hsbc as a foreign bank holding company and our ultimate parent to regularly prepare and submit a sifi plan the doddfrank act focuses on reducing risks to the us financial system requiring a plan to demonstrate how the relevant entities can be resolved table start hsbc usa inc table end in a rapid and orderly fashion in a manner that avoids systemic risks similarly hsbc bank usa must regularly prepare and submit an idi plan hsbc bank usa is required to provide an idi plan to the fdic that is executable for resolving the bank in the event of its failure that protects depositors maximizes the net present value return on assets and minimizes the amount of any losses to creditors including the fdics deposit insurance fund these plans must include information on resolution strategy agreements with major counterparties and interdependencies among other things resolution planning requires substantial effort time and cost across all of our businesses and geographies the hsbc sifi plan is subject to review by both the frb and the fdic and the hsbc bank usa idi plan is subject to review by the fdic in hsbc and hsbc bank usa submitted their latest plans if the frb and the fdic both determine that a sifi plan is not credible which although not defined is generally believed to mean the regulators do not believe the plans are feasible or would otherwise allow resolution of a financial institutions us businesses in a way that protects systemically important functions without severe systemic disruption and without exposing taxpayers to loss and the deficiencies are not remedied within the required time period an institution including hsbc could be required to restructure or reorganize businesses legal entities or operational systems and intracompany transactions in ways that could negatively impact operations or be subject to restrictions on growth hsbc could also eventually be subjected to more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or be required to divest certain assets or operations simultaneous with the tailoring rules the frb and fdic jointly finalized revisions to the sifi plan rule under the sifi plan rule hsbc is required to file a sifi plan every three years alternating between a full resolution plan and a targeted resolution plan which would generally be limited to core areas such as capital and liquidity as well as identifying material changes in other areas of the plan since its last submission hsbcs next submission is a targeted resolution plan which is due by july hsbcs next full resolution plan submission is due on july the sifi plan rule did not revise the idi plan requirements applicable to hsbc bank usa which are administered solely by the fdic in april the fdic requested comment on an advance notice of proposed rulemaking that would alter the fdics separate idi plan requirements for covered idis including hsbc bank usa the proposal delays the requirement for hsbc bank usa as well as other covered idis to file its next idi plan until a future date to be specified by the fdic consequently hsbc bank usa did not file and idi plan during us federal banking agencies may require us to increase our regulatory capital total loss absorbing capacity longterm debt or liquidity requirements which could result in the need to issue additional qualifying securities or to take other actions such as liquidate assets hsbc north america is required to meet consolidated regulatory capital and liquidity requirements including new or modified regulations and related regulatory guidance in accordance with current regulatory timelines in the current regulatory environment capital and liquidity requirements are frequently introduced and amended our regulators may increase regulatory minimum or buffer requirements change how regulatory capital is calculated or increase liquidity requirements a significant component of regulatory capital ratios is calculating our riskweighted assets and our leverage exposure which may increase the basel committee has also revised several key methodologies for measuring riskweighted assets these revisions include changes to the standardized approach for credit risk and operational risk new constraints on the use of internal models introduction of a capital floor based on the revised standardized approaches and a new final standard on the minimum capital requirements for market risk the federal banking agencies may update the us basel iii rule to incorporate the basel committee revisions additionally in the us banking regulators proposed nsfr requirements which target longerterm liquidity risk and would apply to hsbc north america and hsbc usa bank these and other future regulatory or legislative proposals could significantly impact the regulatory capital standards and requirements applicable to financial institutions such as hsbc north america as well as our ability to meet these requirements increases in regulatory capital may also be required in response to other us supervisory requirements participation by hsbc north america in the frbs ccar stress test process also requires that hsbc north america maintain sufficient capital to meet minimum regulatory ratios under multiple forwardlooking stress scenarios across a ninequarter planning horizon the frb has also indicated that it is considering a new measure to replace the capital conservation buffer with a stress capital buffer which would equal a bank holding companys projected decline in its common equity tier capital ratio under the supervisory severely adverse stress testing scenarios plus one year of planned common stock dividends the stress capital buffer would be reset annually based on the bank holding companys dfast results under the supervisory stress tests the stress capital buffer would be subject to a floor of percent of riskweighted assets in line with the current capital conservation buffer rules we are reviewing these possible changes to the capital conservation buffer in anticipation of the formal rulemaking and their potential impact on our capital planning processes specifically and our operations and results generally we may be prohibited from taking capital actions such as paying or increasing dividends or repurchasing securities if the frb objects to our ccar capital plan we currently target internal capital levels using an approach analogous to the stress capital buffer and therefore we do not expect the proposal to have a significant impact on our us operations or change our capital planning processes the exact amount however will depend upon our prevailing risk profile and those of our north america affiliates under various stress scenarios these stress testing requirements will influence our regulatory capital and liquidity planning process and may impose additional operational and compliance costs on us table start hsbc usa inc table end preparation for the us implementation of the basel committees revisions to basel iii has influenced and is likely to continue to influence our regulatory capital and liquidity planning process and is expected to impose additional operational and compliance costs on us we are unable at this time to determine the extent of changes we will need to make to our liquidity or capital position if any and what effect if any such changes will have on our results of operations or financial condition new regulatory capital and liquidity requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital and may require us to increase our capital or liquidity any requirement that we increase our regulatory capital regulatory capital ratios or liquidity could require us to liquidate assets or otherwise change our business andor investment plans which may negatively affect our financial results changes to and compliance with the regulatory capital and liquidity requirements may impact our operations by requiring us to liquidate assets increase borrowings issue additional equity or other securities cease or alter certain operations sell company assets or hold highly liquid assets which may adversely affect our results of operations our interpretation or application of the tax laws to which we are subject could differ from those of the relevant governmental authorities which could result in the payment of additional taxes and penalties we are subject to the various tax laws of the us and its states and municipalities in which we operate these tax laws are inherently complex and we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these laws to the hsbc north america entities operations and businesses our interpretations and application of the tax laws could differ from that of the relevant governmental taxing authority which could result in the potential for the payment of additional taxes penalties or interest which could be material risks related to our business business operations governance and internal control systems our reputation may have a direct impact on our financial results and ongoing operations our ability to attract and retain customers and employees and conduct business transactions with our counterparties could be adversely affected to the extent our reputation or the reputation of affiliates operating under the hsbc brand is damaged reputational risk relates to stakeholders perceptions whether factbased or otherwise stakeholders expectations change constantly and so reputational risk is dynamic and varies between geographical regions groups and individuals any material lapse in standards of integrity compliance customer service or operating efficiency may represent a potential reputational risk our failure to address or to appear to fail to address various issues that could give rise to reputational risk could cause harm to us and our business prospects reputational issues include but are not limited to

proliferation of social media websites as well as the personal use of social media by our employees and others including personal blogs and social network profiles facilitates communication with large audiences in short time frames these social media websites also may increase the risk that negative inappropriate or unauthorized information may be posted or released publicly that could harm our reputation or have other negative consequences including as a result of our employees interacting with our customers in an unauthorized manner in various social media outlets the failure to address or the perception that we have failed to address any of these issues appropriately could make our customers unwilling to do business with us or give rise to increased regulatory action which could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and results of operations table start hsbc usa inc table end our risk management measures may not be successful the management of risk is an integral part of all our activities managing risk effectively is fundamental to the delivery of our strategic priorities while we are subject to a number of legal and regulatory actions and investigations our risk management framework has been designed to provide robust controls and ongoing monitoring of our principal risks risks have the potential to affect the results of our operations or financial condition specifically risk equates to the adverse effect on profitability or financial condition arising from different sources of uncertainty including retail and wholesale credit risk capital and liquidity risk market risk resilience risk regulatory compliance risk financial crime risk strategic risk and model risk to manage risk we employ a risk management framework at all levels and across all risk types the framework fosters the continuous monitoring of the risk environment and an integrated evaluation of risks and their interactions it also strives to ensure that we have a robust and consistent approach to risk management across all of our activities while our risk management framework employs a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques such techniques and the judgments that accompany their application cannot anticipate every unfavorable event or the specifics and timing of every outcome failure to manage risks appropriately could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and results of operations our risk management measures may face particularly significant challenges in the following three broad areas a macroeconomic and geopolitical risks unfavorable economic and market conditions may adversely affect our results b risks related to our businesses business operations governance and internal systems the delivery of our strategic priorities is subject to execution risk and we may not achieve all the expected benefits of our strategic initiatives our operations are subject to the threat of fraudulent activity and disruption from the external environment we are highly dependent on our information technology systems we could incur losses or be required to hold additional capital as a result of model limitations or failure issues with the quality of data or effectiveness of our data aggregation and validation procedures could result in ineffective risk management practices or inaccurate risk reporting c regulatory and legal risks to our businesses we are subject to a number of legal and regulatory actions and investigations the outcomes of which are inherently difficult to predict but unfavorable outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and brand unfavorable legislative or regulatory developments or changes in the policy of regulators or governments could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition and prospects failure to effectively implement our business strategies may adversely affect our financial performance our business strategy is described under the heading managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview business update implementation of our business strategy will require significant time and require us to incur significant expense see note subsequent events of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further detail the actual costs and time required may exceed our estimates additionally implementation of our business strategy will affect our employees customers and other stakeholders and could adversely impact our relationships with stakeholders and our reputation our strategies for business growth include focusing our sales efforts on international connectivity strategies with high quality internationally minded clients as well as augmenting our returns through increased crossselling and cost optimization further we may fail to attract internationally mobile clients or crosssell our services to them see our crossselling efforts to increase the number of products our customers buy from us and offer them all of the financial products that fulfill their needs is a key part of our growth strategy and our failure to execute this strategy effectively could have a material adverse effect on our revenue growth and financial results the work required to execute on our growth strategies is substantial alongside the strategic actions we continue to implement a number of externally driven regulatory remediation programs the magnitude and complexity of the projects required to meet these demands has resulted in heightened execution risk additionally we may be unable to fully realize the cost optimization efforts and the other anticipated benefits from those efforts and we may not be able to realize them in the currently anticipated timeframes the cumulative impact of the collective change initiatives underway is significant and has direct implications on resourcing and our people failure to successfully implement our business strategies may have a material adverse effect on our businesses prospects financial condition and results of operations our crossselling efforts to increase the number of products our customers buy from us and offer them all of the financial products that fulfill their needs is a key part of our growth strategy and our failure to execute this strategy effectively could have a material adverse effect on our revenue growth and financial results selling more products to our customers crossselling is very important to our business model and key to our ability to grow revenue and earnings competition within the industry can limit our ability to sell more products to our customers or influence us to sell our products at lower prices reducing our net interest income and revenue from our feebased products it could also affect our ability to keep existing customers new technologies could require us to spend more to modify or adapt our products to attract and retain customers our crosssell strategy also is dependent on earning more business from our customers and increasing our crosssell ratio or the average number of products sold to existing customers which may become more challenging table start hsbc usa inc table end operational risks are inherent in our businesses and may adversely impact our businesses and reputation we are exposed to many types of operational risks that are inherent in banking operations including fraudulent and other criminal activities both internal and external breakdowns in processes or procedures and systems failure or nonavailability see a failure in our infrastructure or those of our third party vendors and other service providers that results in a loss of information delays our ability to access information or impacts our ability to provide services to our clients may materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations for example fraudsters may target any of our products services and delivery channels including lending internet banking payments bank accounts and cards these risks apply equally when we rely on outside suppliers outsourcing vendors and our affiliates to provide services to us and our customers these operational risks may result in financial loss to us an adverse customer experience reputational damage and potential regulatory action depending on the circumstances of the event which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses prospects financial condition and results of operation further there is a risk that our operating system controls as well as business continuity and data security systems could prove to be inadequate any such failure could affect our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations by requiring us to expend significant resources to correct the defect as well as exposing us to litigation or losses not covered by insurance our operations are subject to disruption from the external environment we may be subject to disruptions of our operating systems infrastructure arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control which may include table start computer viruses electrical telecommunications or other essential utility outages table endtable start natural disasters such as hurricanes or other severe weather conditions and earthquakes table endtable start events arising from local regional or international politics including terrorist acts or acts of war or table endtable start absence of operating systems personnel due to global pandemics or otherwise which could have a significant effect on our business operations as well as on hsbc affiliates worldwide table end such disruptions may give rise to losses in service or disruption to customers an inability to collect our receivables in affected areas physical damage or loss of life and other loss or liability to us which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses prospects financial condition and results of operations a failure in our infrastructure or those of our third party vendors and other service providers that results in a loss of information delays our ability to access information or impacts our ability to provide services to our clients may materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process large volumes of data that require global capabilities and scale from our technology platforms if our technology or communications fail or those of industry utilities or our service providers fail we could experience production and system outages or failures or other significant operational delays any such outage failure or delay could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions or service our clients which could expose us to liability for damages result in the loss of business damage our reputation subject us to regulatory scrutiny or sanctions or expose us to litigation any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations security or technology disruptions failures or delays that impact our communications or information systems could also adversely affect our ability to manage our exposure to risk or expand our business upgrading our computer systems software and networks may also subject us to disruptions failures or delays due to the complexity and interconnectedness of our systems software and networks the failure to upgrade or maintain these computer systems software and networks could result in greater susceptibility to attacks unauthorized access and misuse and could also prevent us from achieving our business continuity and resiliency objectives there can be no assurance that any such disruptions failures or delays will not occur or if they do occur that they will be adequately addressed third parties with which we do business or that facilitate our business activities could also be sources of technology risk to us including from breakdowns failures or delays of their own systems or capacity constraints or other services that impair our ability to process transactions and communicate with customers and counterparties in addition we are exposed to the risk that a technology disruption or other information security event at a vendor common to our thirdparty service providers could impede their ability to provide products or services to us we may not be able to effectively monitor or mitigate operational risks relating to the use of common vendors by thirdparty service providers as a result of financial entities central agents clearing agents and houses exchanges and technology systems across the globe becoming more

affect our borrowers potentially increasing the risk that such borrowers may fail to repay their loans changes in frb policies are beyond our control and can be hard to predict our data management and policies and processes may not be sufficiently robust critical business processes across the hsbc group rely on large volumes of data from a number of different systems and sources if data governance data quality and data architecture policies and procedures are not sufficiently robust manual intervention adjustments and reconciliations may be required to reduce the risk of error in reporting to senior management or regulators inadequate policies and processes may also table start hsbc usa inc table end affect our ability to use data to service customers more effectively andor improve our

requirements established by their regulators or with the principles for effective risk data aggregation and risk reporting as set out by the basel committee may face supervisory measures any of these failures could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and results of operations we face significant and increasing competition in the rapidly evolving financial services industry we compete with other financial institutions in a highly competitive industry that continues to undergo significant change as a result of financial regulatory reform and increased public scrutiny stemming from the financial crisis and the challenging economic conditions that followed we target internationally mobile clients who need sophisticated global solutions and we generally compete on the basis of the quality of our customer service the wide variety of products and services that we can offer our customers and the ability of those products and services to satisfy our customers needs the extensive distribution channels available for our customers our innovation and our reputation continued or increased competition in any one or all of these areas may negatively affect our market share and results of operations andor cause us to increase our capital investment in our businesses in order to remain competitive additionally if our products and services are not accepted by our targeted clients this may have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition and results of operations given the current economic regulatory and political environment for large financial institutions such as us and possible public backlash to bank fees there is increased competitive pressure to provide products and services at current or lower prices consequently our ability to reposition or reprice our products and services from time to time may be limited and could be influenced significantly by the actions of our competitors who may or may not charge similar fees for their products and services any changes in the types of products and services that we offer our customers andor the pricing for those products and services could result in a loss of customers and market share and could materially adversely affect our results of operations further new technologies could require us to spend more to modify or adapt our products to attract and retain customers continued technological advances and the growth of ecommerce have made it possible for nondepository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products and for financial institutions other companies to provide electronic and internetbased financial solutions including electronic payment solutions we may not respond effectively to these competitive threats from existing and new competitors and may be forced to increase our investment in our businesses to modify or adapt our existing products and services or develop new products and services to respond to our customers needs any of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our businesses prospects financial condition and results of operations we have significant exposure to counterparty risk we are exposed to counterparties that are involved in virtually all major industries and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in financial services including brokers and dealers central clearing counterparties commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default by our counterparty or client our ability to engage in routine transactions to fund our operations and manage our risks could be materially adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial services institutions financial institutions are necessarily interdependent because of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships as a consequence a default by or decline in market confidence in individual institutions or anxiety about the financial services industry generally can lead to further individual andor systemic difficulties defaults and losses mandatory central clearing of over the counter derivatives including under the doddfrank act brings with it risk as a clearing member we have financial exposure for losses incurred at a central counterparty ccp by the default of other clearing members hence increased moves toward central clearing brings with it a further element of interconnectedness between clearing members and clients that we believe may increase rather than reduce our exposure to systemic risk at the same time our ability to manage such risk ourselves will be reduced because risk controls are largely managed by the ccps themselves and it is unclear at present how at a time of stress regulators and resolution authorities would intervene in situations in which we strive to mitigate counterparty risk by taking collateral our credit risk may remain high if the collateral we hold cannot be realized or must be liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of our exposure to the respective counterparty there is a risk that collateral cannot be realized including situations where this arises by change of law that may influence our ability to foreclose on collateral or otherwise enforce contractual rights we also have credit exposure arising from risk defeasance products such as credit default swaps cdss and other credit derivatives each of which is carried at fair value the risk of default by counterparties to cdss and other credit derivatives used as mitigants affects the fair value of these instruments depending on the valuation and the perceived credit risk of the underlying instrument against which protection has been purchased any such adjustments or fair value changes may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations the financial condition of our clients and counterparties including other financial institutions could adversely affect us a significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of our counterparties could lead to concerns in the market about the credit table start hsbc usa inc table end quality of other counterparties in the same industry thereby exacerbating our credit risk exposure and increasing the losses including marktomarket losses that we could incur in our marketmaking and clearing businesses financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of marketmaking trading clearing counterparty or other relationships as a consequence a default by or decline in market confidence in individual institutions or anxiety about the financial services industry generally can lead to further individual andor systemic difficulties defaults and losses hsbc routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by the counterparty or client when such a counterparty or client becomes bankrupt or insolvent we may become involved in significant disputes or litigation with the counterpartys or clients bankruptcy estate and other creditors or involved in regulatory investigations each of which could increase our operational and litigation costs significant or prolonged periods of market stress or illiquidity could further decrease our ability to realize the fair value of collateral held by us or make it more likely that we would liquidate collateral at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of our exposure to the respective counterparty or client further disputes with counterparties as to the valuation of collateral significantly increase in times of market stress and illiquidity increased credit risk including as a result of a deterioration in economic conditions could require us to increase our provision for credit losses and allowance for credit losses and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition when we loan money or commit to loan money we incur credit risk or the risk of losses if our borrowers do not repay their loans the credit performance of our loan portfolios significantly affects our financial results and condition if the current economic environment were to deteriorate more of our customers may have difficulty in repaying their loans or other obligations which could result in a higher level of credit losses and provision for credit losses we reserve for credit losses by establishing an allowance through a charge to earnings the amount of this allowance has historically been based on our assessment of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio including unfunded credit commitments the process for determining the amount of the allowance is critical to our financial results and condition it requires difficult subjective and complex judgments about the future including forecasts of economic or market conditions that might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans we might increase the allowance because of changing economic conditions including falling home prices and higher unemployment or other factors for example changes in borrower behavior or the regulatory environment also could influence recognition of credit losses in the portfolio and our allowance for credit losses while we believe that our allowance for credit losses was appropriate at december there is no assurance that it will be sufficient to cover future credit losses on january we adopted new accounting guidance which requires the recognition of lifetime expected credit losses see note summary of significant accounting policies and new accounting pronouncements of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further detail in the event of a deterioration in economic conditions we may be required to increase reserves in future periods which would reduce our earnings failure to meet regulatory requirements and expectations in the us regarding sales practices and incentive compensation programs could negatively impact our customers our business and reputation our remuneration practices and performance management framework are designed to prevent and deter conflicts of interest and inappropriate sales incentives additionally our other sales controls including our framework for handling customer and employee complaints regarding sales practices are designed to ensure customers receive products that they have authorized and meet their needs failure to execute our sales controls could result in the sale of or upgrade to products and services that fail to meet the needs of or are unsuitable for customers and clients and can lead to financial harm to our customers regulatory sanctions financial loss and reputational damage failure to appropriately address potential conflicts of interest can result in reputational harm as well as litigation and enforcement actions our ability to appropriately address potential conflicts of interest has become increasingly complex as our business activities encompass more transactions with and among our diversified client and customer base we can become subject to litigation and enforcement actions and our reputation can be damaged by the failure or perceived failure to table start adequately address or appropriately disclose conflicts of interest table endtable start treat clients and customers with the appropriate standard of care and table endtable start provide fiduciary products or services in accordance with the applicable legal and regulatory standards table end a failure or perceived failure to appropriately address conflicts of interest or fiduciary obligations could result in customer dissatisfaction litigation and regulatory fines penalties or other sanctions and heightened regulatory scrutiny and enforcement actions all of which could adversely affect our businesses and reputation new customer privacy initiatives may impose additional operational burdens on us may limit our ability to pursue desirable business initiatives and increase the risks associated with any future use of customer data recent legislative and regulatory efforts to protect the privacy of consumer data limit how companies can use customer data and impose obligations on companies in their management of such data as a financial services company we necessarily gather maintain and use a significant amount of customer data other jurisdictions may adopt similar requirements that impose different and potentially inconsistent compliance burdens these initiatives particularly to the extent multiple jurisdictions adopt inconsistent requirements could increase table start hsbc usa inc table end compliance complexity and related costs result in significant financial penalties for compliance failures and limit our ability to develop new products or respond to technological changes they also could heighten the reputational impact of perceived misuses of customer data by us our vendors or others who gain unauthorized access to our customer data we may not manage risks associated with the replacement of benchmark rates effectively the expected replacement of benchmarks including the key london interbank offered rate libor with alternative benchmark rates and our development of products linked to alternate benchmark rates introduces a number of risks for us our clients and the financial services industry more widely this includes but is not limited to table start legal and execution risks relating to documentation changes for new products and the transition of legacy contracts to alternate benchmark rates which transition will in turn depend to a certain extent on the availability of alternate benchmark rate products and on the participation of customers and third party market participants in the transition process legal proceedings or other actions regarding the interpretation and enforceability of provisions in liborbased contracts and regulatory investigations or reviews in respect of our preparation and readiness for the replacement of libor with alternative reference rates table endtable start financial risks arising from any changes in the valuation of financial instruments linked to benchmark rates and the implementation of the international swaps and derivatives associations proposed protocol for the transition of derivatives contracts table endtable start pricing risks as changes to benchmark indices could impact pricing mechanisms on some instruments table endtable start operational risks due to the need for us our customers and the market to adapt it systems trade reporting infrastructure operational processes and

not ready and able to adapt their own processes and systems to accommodate the alternative benchmark rate products table end the benchmark specifications together with the timetable and mechanisms for implementation have not yet been agreed across the industry and regulatory authorities accordingly it is not currently possible to determine whether or to what extent any such changes would affect us however the discontinuation of existing benchmark rates could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations prospects and customers we could incur losses or be required to hold additional capital as a result of model limitations or failure we use models for a range of purposes in managing our businesses including regulatory capital calculations stress testing credit approvals financial crime and fraud risk management and financial reporting we could face adverse consequences as a result of decisions which may lead to actions by management based on models that are poorly developed implemented or used or as a result of the modeled outcome being misunderstood or the use of such information for purposes for which it was not designed we hold capital for known risks and limitations of our models as appropriate if additional weakness in a model is discovered or if a model is shown to have failed we may be required to hold more capital risks arising from use of models could have a material adverse effect on our businesses financial condition andor results of operations minimum capital requirements and reputation regulatory scrutiny and supervisory concerns over the use by banks of models is considerable particularly the internal models and assumptions used by banks in the application of the stress testing exercise and in the calculation of regulatory capital management projections estimates and judgments based on historical performance may not be indicative of our future performance our management is required to use certain estimates in preparing our financial statements including accounting estimates to determine loan loss reserves reserves related to litigation deferred tax assets and the fair market value of certain assets and liabilities including goodwill and intangibles among other items in particular loan loss reserve estimates and certain asset and liability valuations such as goodwill are subject to managements judgment and actual results are influenced by factors outside our control to the extent historical averages are not predictive of future losses and management is unable to accurately evaluate the portfolio risk factors not fully reflected in its current loss estimate unexpected additional losses could result similarly to the extent assumptions employed in measuring fair value of assets and liabilities are not supported by market prices or other observable parameters do not sufficiently capture their inherent risk including management estimates of future cash flows used to determine the fair value of goodwill unexpected additional losses could result we are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and record a charge to income or equity if we determine based on available evidence at the time the determination is made that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance we estimate future taxable income based on management approved business plans future capital requirements and ongoing tax planning strategies this evaluation process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period the recognition of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant judgments about future earnings the periods in which items will impact taxable income future corporate tax rates and the application of inherently complex tax laws the use of different estimates can result in changes in the amounts of deferred tax items recognized which can result in equity and earnings volatility because such changes are reported in current period earnings see note income taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our deferred tax assets table start hsbc usa inc table end our financial statements depend on our internal controls over financial reporting the sarbanesoxley act of requires our management to evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting we are required to disclose in our annual report on form 10k the existence of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in a company as large and complex as ours lapses or deficiencies including significant deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting may occur from time to time and we cannot assure you that we will not find one or more material weaknesses as of the end of any given year changes in accounting standards are beyond our control and may have a material impact on how we report our financial results and condition our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations from time to time the fasb the iasb the sec and our bank regulators including the occ and the frb change the financial accounting and reporting standards or the interpretation thereof and guidance that govern the preparation and disclosure of external financial statements these changes are beyond our control can be hard to predict and could materially impact how we report and disclose our financial results and condition including our segment results for example the fasbs new guidance on expected credit losses will significantly change how we measure credit impairment on our loan portfolios which will also affect the level of deferred tax assets that we recognize we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively resulting in our restating prior period financial statements in material amounts we may in certain instances change a business practice in order to comply with new or revised standards for further discussion see note summary of significant accounting policies and new accounting pronouncements in the accompanying consolidated financial statements key employees may be difficult to attract or retain due to talent available in the market and the improved economic environment our employees are our most important resource and in many areas of the financial services industry competition for qualified personnel is intense employee fatigue relocations and external competition targeting top talent could have impacts on attrition if we were unable to continue to attract develop and retain qualified key employees to support the various functions of our businesses our performance including our competitive position could be impacted see failure to effectively implement our business strategies may adversely affect our financial performance any future limitations on executive compensation imposed by legislation or regulation could adversely affect our ability to attract and maintain qualified employees we may face increased difficulty in retaining top performers and critical skilled employees if key personnel were to leave us and equally knowledgeable or skilled personnel are unavailable within the hsbc group or could not be sourced in the market our ability to manage our businesses in particular through any future difficult economic environment may be compromised significant reductions in pension assets may require additional financial contributions from us certain employees are eligible to participate in the hsbc north america qualified defined benefit pension plan which has been frozen while plan assets were higher than projected plan liabilities resulting in an overfunded status of approximately million at december changes in market conditions could result in an underfunded status occurring in future periods because these obligations relate to the hsbc north america pension plan only a portion of any deficit could be considered our responsibility we and other hsbc north america affiliates with employees participating in this plan will be required to make up any shortfall over a number of years as specified under the pension protection act this can be accomplished through direct contributions appreciation in plan assets andor increases in interest rates resulting in lower liability valuations
