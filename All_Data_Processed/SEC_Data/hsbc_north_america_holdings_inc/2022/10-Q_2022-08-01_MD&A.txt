our economic environment us economic activity slowed during the first half of us gross domestic product gdp contracted at an estimated annual rate of percent in the second quarter of repercussions from the russiaukraine war alongside the economic impacts that continue to result from the covid19 pandemic have disrupted supply chains and increased energy prices there has also been a significant rise in inflation which reached a 40year high in june the personal consumption expenditures price index increased to an estimated annual rate of percent in the second quarter of well above the frbs target inflation rate the frb increased shortterm interest rates by a total of basis points during the first half of and has announced that it will increase shortterm interest rates further during the second half of in order to fight inflation these conditions have created significant uncertainty about the future economic environment which will continue to evolve and impact our business in future periods while our credit risk exposure to russia was immaterial at june it is difficult to anticipate the full effect of sanctions announced to date on our business and on our customers concerns over interest rate levels energy prices domestic and global policy issues trade policy in the us and geopolitical events as well as the implications of those events on the markets in general further add to the global uncertainty there is also a risk that interest rate increases to fight inflation could lead to a recession interest rate levels and energy prices in combination with global economic conditions fiscal and monetary policy and the level of regulatory and government scrutiny of financial institutions will continue to impact our results in and beyond performance developments and trends we continue to progress our strategic plan to restructure our operations restructuring plan as discussed further in note strategic initiatives in the accompanying consolidated financial

income before income tax was million and million during the three and six months ended june respectively compared with million and million during the three and six months ended june respectively the decrease in income before income tax during the three and six months ended june was due primarily to a higher provision for credit losses which reflected loss provisions in the current year periods driven by the weakening of economic conditions compared with releases in credit loss reserves in the prior year periods driven by improved economic conditions and the impact of our decision to exit our mass market retail banking business which resulted in a release of credit loss reserves and a reduction to the provision for credit losses of approximately million during the second quarter of this decrease was partially offset by lower operating expenses and higher other revenues driven by higher trading revenue and in the yeartodate period the gain on sale of the branch disposal group as discussed above while net interest income was lower and contributed to the decrease in the yeartodate period it was higher in the threemonth period our reported results in all periods were impacted by

resources for further discussion on funding and capital and credit quality for additional discussion on our credit trends london interbank offered rate libor transition regulators and central banks in various national jurisdictions continue to actively work to help transition from interbank offered rates to acceptable alternative rates such as the secured overnight financing rate sofr recommended by the alternative reference rates committee convened by the frb in march the adjustable interest rate act libor act was signed into law in order to provide a federal solution for replacing usd libor with a sofrbased rate in certain legacy liborbased contracts under the libor act the frb is required to issue a regulation within days identifying which version of sofr will apply this federal legislation is expected to facilitate the transition of certain of our legacy liborbased contracts which do not specify a replacement rate or contain an adequate fallback mechanism we continue to actively participate in hsbcs global transition program with the objective of facilitating an orderly transition of all products processes models and curves as well as all legacy liborbased contracts onto replacement rates the current focus of our client transition efforts is on those remaining contracts that will be impacted by usd libor tenors ceasing or becoming nonrepresentative immediately after june such contracts outstanding at june included contracts for nonderivative financial assets with a carrying value of approximately billion primarily consisting of usd liborbased loans contracts for nonderivative financial liabilities with a carrying value of approximately billion primarily consisting of usd liborbased longterm debt billion of which is already set to transition to sofr as of july and contracts for usd liborbased derivatives with a notional value of approximately billion the substantial majority of our outstanding usd liborbased derivative contracts adhere to and are covered by the international swaps and derivatives association fallback protocol the ability of husi and its clients to transition legacy contracts onto replacement rates is dependent on the availability of products that reference replacement rates including sofr and on our customers being ready and able to adapt their own processes and systems to accommodate the replacement products market readiness in support of usd libor transition could slow the transition and we remain prepared that the transition of outstanding contracts could be concentrated in late and the first half of we continue to engage with industry participants the official sector and our clients to support an orderly transition and the mitigation of the risks resulting from the transition for further discussion of our libor transition program and the associated risks see executive overview in mda in our form 10k hsbc usa inc basis of reporting our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap group reporting basis we report financial information to hsbc in accordance with hsbc group accounting and reporting policies which apply international financial reporting standards ifrss as issued by the iasb as a result our segment results are prepared and presented using financial information prepared on the basis of hsbc groups accounting and reporting policies group reporting basis because operating results on the group reporting basis are used in managing our businesses and rewarding performance of employees our management also separately monitors profit before tax under this basis of reporting the following table reconciles our us gaap versus group reporting basis profit before tax three months ended june six months ended june in millions profit before tax us gaap basis adjustments expected credit losses other longlived assets loans held for sale renewable energy tax credit investments pension and other postretirement benefit costs other profit before tax group reporting basis the significant differences between us gaap and the group reporting basis as they impact our results are summarized in note business segments in our form 10k there have been no significant changes since december in the differences between us gaap and the group reporting basis impacting our results differences in reported profit before tax in the table above that were individually significant for the periods presented are explained below during the three and six months ended june expected credit losses were higher under us gaap than under the group reporting basis under the group reporting basis a majority of our loans are considered to be in stage which requires a 12month expected credit losses estimate while under us gaap such loans require a lifetime expected credit losses ecl estimate primarily as a result of the different requirements loss provisions driven by the weakening of economic conditions including a worsening of economic forecasts in the threemonth period as well as higher provisions associated with loan growth and maturity extensions were more pronounced under us gaap during the three and six months ended june expected credit losses were lower under us gaap than under the group reporting basis primarily as a result of the different requirements related to stage loans discussed above releases in credit reserves driven by improved economic conditions which resulted in improved economic forecasts as well as client paydowns were more pronounced under us gaap during the three and six months ended june and amortization expense for longlived assets was higher under us gaap during the third quarter of we recorded an impairment charge under the group reporting basis related to the writeoff of all the capitalized software and a portion of the leasehold improvements primarily associated with our wealth and personal banking business segment while under us gaap no impairment charge was required consequently the carrying amounts for capitalized software and leasehold improvements are higher under us gaap than under the group reporting basis and as a result corresponding amortization expense is higher under us gaap in addition during the second quarter of we determined we would exit certain branches as part of our restructuring plan and as a result we recorded an impairment charge of million under us gaap to writeoff the leasehold improvements associated with these branches these leasehold improvements were previously writtenoff under the group reporting basis as discussed above during the six months ended june loans held for sale in the table above reflects a higher gain on loan sales under the group reporting basis than under us gaap which includes the gain on sale of the branch disposal group the higher gain under the group reporting basis was due primarily to the releases of credit loss reserves previously recorded on the loans under us gaap when they were transferred to held for sale in also contributing to the higher gain under the group reporting basis was the higher carrying amount of leasehold improvements associated with the sold branches under us gaap at the time of sale these leasehold improvements were previously determined to be impaired and writtenoff under the group reporting basis as discussed above hsbc usa inc during the three and six months ended june we transferred certain loans to held for sale which under us gaap requires the loans to be carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value which resulted in a release of credit loss reserves on the loans under the group reporting basis loans held for sale continue to be accounted for and credit losses continue to be measured in accordance with ifrs financial instruments with any gain or loss recorded at the time of sale in addition a portion of the loans transferred under us gaap did not meet the more stringent criteria for held for sale

to affiliates the increase in commercial nonaffiliate loans was primarily in the software real estate banking commercial services and retailing industries consumer loans increased compared with december due primarily to the transfer of certain residential mortgage and home equity mortgage loans from held for sale to held for investment during the second quarter of with a carrying value which

index hpi at either a core based statistical area or state level the estimated value of the homes could differ from actual fair values due to changes in condition of the underlying property variations in housing price changes within metropolitan statistical areas and other factors as a result actual property values associated with loans that end in foreclosure may be significantly lower than the estimates used for purposes of this disclosure current estimated property values are calculated using the most current hpis available and applied on an individual loan basis which results in an

consolidated financial statements for a breakout of trading securities by category trading securities balances were lower compared with december due primarily to a decrease in equity positions partially offset by an increase in foreign sovereign positions trading security positions are held as economic hedges of interest rate credit and equity derivative products issued to clients of domestic and emerging markets balances of securities sold not yet purchased were lower compared with december driven by a decline in short us treasury positions related to economic hedges of derivatives in the interest rate trading portfolio precious metals trading assets decreased compared with december due to a decrease in our own gold inventory position and lower spot prices partially offset by an increase in our own silver inventory position payables for precious metals were higher compared with december reflecting an increase in borrowing of gold inventory to support client activity levels precious metal positions may not represent our net underlying exposure as we may use derivatives contracts to reduce our risk associated with these positions the fair value of which would appear in derivatives in the table above derivative asset and liability balances both increased compared with december mainly from market movements which resulted in higher valuations of foreign exchange commodity and credit derivatives partially offset by lower valuations of interest rate derivatives market movements on equity derivatives were mixed resulting in high derivative asset valuations but lower derivative liability valuations securities securities include securities availableforsale and securities heldtomaturity net securities balances were lower compared with december driven by unfavorable market valuations due to increasing yields as well as net sales and paydowns as part of our continuing strategy to maximize returns while balancing the securities portfolio for

compared with releases in credit loss reserves in the prior year periods the loss provisions in the current year periods were driven by the weakening of economic conditions which resulted in increases in credit reserves for risk factors associated with large loan and higher risk industry exposures supply chain disruptions and energy price uncertainty as well as weakness in the financial condition of certain clients and in the current threemonth period a worsening of economic forecasts also contributing to the loss provisions in the current year periods were higher provisions associated with loan growth and maturity extensions in the prior year periods the releases in credit reserves were driven by improved economic conditions which resulted in improved economic forecasts and improvements in the credit condition of certain clients as well as declines in credit reserves for risk factors associated with higher risk client exposures and in the yeartodate period economic uncertainty client paydowns and loan sales also contributed to the releases in the prior year periods the provision for credit losses on our consumer loan portfolio increased million and million during the three and six months ended june respectively due primarily to releases in credit loss reserves in the prior year periods driven by our decision to exit our mass market retail banking business which resulted in a release of credit loss reserves and a reduction to the provision for credit losses of approximately million during the second quarter of including declines in credit reserves for risk factors primarily associated with economic uncertainty and forbearance accounts also contributing to the releases in credit reserves in the prior year periods were improved economic conditions which resulted in improved economic forecasts in the current year threemonth period a modest loss provision was driven by the weakening of economic conditions which resulted in a worsening of economic forecasts in the current yeartodate period the provision for credit losses was relatively flat as an increase in credit reserves for risk factors associated with economic uncertainty was more than offset by the impact of net recoveries the provision for credit losses on offbalance sheet credit exposures increased million during the three months ended june reflecting a modest loss provision in the current year period resulting from the weakening of economic conditions compared with a release in credit loss reserves in the prior year period resulting from improved economic conditions in the hsbc usa inc yeartodate period the provision for credit losses on offbalance sheet credit exposures increased million reflecting a lower release in credit loss reserves the modest release in credit reserves in the

the sale of a portfolio of consumer mortgage loans also contributing to the decrease in both periods were higher losses associated with bank owned life insurance lower gains on sales of commercial

bank usa to htsu support services during the first quarter of support services from hsbc affiliates servicing and other fees from hsbc affiliates increased during the three and six months ended june

agreement as well as higher costs associated with our investments in systems infrastructure and new technologies in addition the increase reflects higher expense due to the transfer of certain wholesale operations staff from hsbc bank usa to htsu support services as discussed above these increases were partially offset by lower cost allocations from our support service functions driven by

replacement cost of derivative contracts in a receivable position in the event the counterparties of such contracts fail to perform under the terms of those contracts in managing derivative credit risk both the current exposure which is the replacement cost of contracts on the measurement date as well as an estimate of the potential change in value of contracts over their remaining lives are considered counterparties to our derivative activities include financial institutions central clearing parties foreign and domestic government agencies corporations funds mutual funds hedge funds etc insurance companies and private clients as well as other hsbc entities these counterparties are subject to regular credit review by the credit risk management department to minimize credit risk we may enter into legally enforceable master netting agreements which reduce risk by permitting the closeout and netting of transactions with the same counterparty upon occurrence of certain events in addition we reduce credit risk by obtaining collateral from counterparties the determination of the need for and the levels of collateral will differ based on an assessment of the credit risk of the counterparty andor regulatory requirements the total risk in a derivative contract is a function of a number of variables such as volatility of interest rates currencies equity or corporate reference entity used as the basis for determining contract payments current market events or trends country risk maturity and liquidity of contracts creditworthiness of the counterparties in the transaction the existence of a master netting agreement among the counterparties and existence and value of collateral received from counterparties to secure exposures the table below presents total credit risk exposure calculated using the general riskbased capital rules of the basel iii standardized approach which includes the net positive marktomarket of the derivative contracts plus any adjusted potential future exposure as measured in reference to the notional amount the regulatory capital rules recognize that bilateral netting agreements reduce credit risk and therefore allow for reductions of riskweighted assets when netting requirements have been met and collateral exists as a result riskweighted amounts for regulatory capital purposes are a portion of the original gross exposures furthermore many contracts contain provisions that allow us to close out the transaction if the counterparty fails to post required collateral in addition many contracts give us the right to break the transactions earlier than the final maturity date as a result these contracts have potential future exposures that are often much smaller than the future exposures derived from the regulatory capital

arrangements as part of our normal operations we enter into credit derivatives and various offbalance sheet arrangements with affiliates and third parties these arrangements arise principally in connection with our lending and client intermediation activities and involve primarily commitments to extend credit and in certain cases guarantees commitments to extend credit include arrangements whereby we are contractually obligated to extend credit in the form of loans participations in loans or similar transactions at june and december we had commitments to extend credit totaling billion and billion respectively comprised primarily of commercial commitments and to a lesser extent consumer commitments commercial commitments comprise primarily those related to secured and unsecured loans and lines of credit consumer commitments comprise unused mastercardvisa credit card lines where we have the right to change terms or conditions upon notification to the customer and commitments

letters of credit and certain credit derivative transactions as well as the contractual amounts outstanding at june and december see note guarantee arrangements pledged asset and repurchase agreements in the accompanying consolidated financial statements the contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent our maximum possible credit exposure in the event that a counterparty draws down the full commitment amount or we are required to fulfill our maximum obligation under a guarantee many of these commitments and guarantees expire unused or without default in addition implementation of our business strategy as described under the heading executive overview events in our form 10k will affect our hsbc usa inc contractual obligations over time including with respect to consumer

fair value fair value hierarchy fair value measurement accounting principles establish a fair value hierarchy structure that prioritizes the inputs to determine the fair value of an asset or liability the fair value framework the fair value framework distinguishes between inputs that are based on observed market data and unobservable inputs that reflect market participants assumptions it emphasizes the use of valuation methodologies that maximize observable market inputs for financial instruments carried at fair value the best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an actively traded market level where the market for a financial instrument is not active valuation techniques are used the majority of our valuation techniques use market inputs that are either observable or indirectly derived from and corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the financial instrument level because level and level instruments are determined by observable inputs less judgment is applied in determining their fair values in the absence of observable market inputs the financial instrument is valued based on valuation techniques that feature one or more significant unobservable inputs level the determination of the level of fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement of an asset or a liability is classified often requires judgment and may change over time as market conditions evolve we consider the following factors in developing the fair value hierarchy whether the asset or liability is transacted in an active market with a quoted market price the level of bidask spreads a lack of pricing transparency due to among other things complexity of the product and market liquidity whether only a few transactions are observed over a significant period of time whether the pricing quotations differ substantially among independent pricing services whether inputs to the valuation techniques can be derived from or corroborated with market data and whether significant adjustments are made to the observed pricing information or model output to determine the fair value level inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that the reporting entity has the ability to access for identical assets or liabilities a financial instrument is classified as a level measurement if it is listed on an exchange or is an instrument actively traded in the overthecounter otc market where transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume we regard financial instruments such as debt securities equity securities and derivative contracts listed on the primary exchanges of a country to be actively traded nonexchangetraded instruments classified as level assets include securities issued by the us treasury tobeannounced securities noncallable securities issued by us government sponsored enterprises and certain foreign governmentbacked debt level inputs are those that are observable either directly or indirectly but do not qualify as level inputs we classify mortgage passthrough securities agency and certain nonagency mortgage collateralized obligations nonexchangetraded derivative contracts assetbacked securities obligations of us states and political subdivisions corporate debt securities certain foreign governmentbacked debt preferred securities securities purchased and sold under resale and repurchase agreements precious metals certain loans held for sale certain student loans residential mortgage loans whose carrying amount was reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral and real estate owned as level measurements where possible at least two quotations from independent sources are obtained based on transactions involving comparable assets and liabilities to validate the fair value of these instruments we have established a process to understand the methodologies and inputs used by the third party pricing services to ensure that pricing information meets the fair value objective and where appropriate this pricing data is backtested to market trade executions where significant differences arise among the independent pricing quotes and the internally determined fair value we investigate and reconcile the differences if the investigation results in a significant adjustment to the fair value the instrument will be classified as level within the fair value hierarchy in general we have observed that there is a correlation between the credit standing and the market liquidity of a nonderivative instrument level derivative instruments are generally valued based on discounted future cash flows or an option pricing model adjusted for counterparty credit risk and market liquidity the fair value of certain derivative products is determined using valuation techniques based on inputs derived from observable indices traded in the otc market appropriate control processes and hsbc usa inc procedures have been applied to ensure that the derived inputs are applied to value only those instruments that share similar risks to the relevant benchmark indices and therefore demonstrate a similar response to market factors level inputs are unobservable estimates that management expects market participants would use to determine the fair value of the asset or liability that is level inputs incorporate market participants assumptions about risk and the risk premium required by market participants in order to bear that risk we develop level inputs based on the best information available in the circumstances at june and december our level measurements included the following certain structured deposits and structured notes for which the embedded derivatives have significant unobservable inputs eg volatility or default correlations certain assetbacked securities individually assessed commercial loans mortgage servicing rights derivatives with certain inputs which are unobservable certain credit default swaps certain loans held for sale and swap agreements entered into in conjunction with the sales of visa class b shares for which the fair value is dependent upon the final resolution of the related litigation see note fair value measurements in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on level inputs level measurements the following table provides information about level assetsliabilities in relation to total assetsliabilities measured at fair value at june and december june december  are in millions level assets total assets measured at fair value level liabilities total liabilities measured at fair value level assets as a percent of total assets measured at fair value level liabilities as a percent of total liabilities measured at fair value presented without netting which allows the offsetting of amounts relating to certain contracts if certain conditions are met includes million of recurring level assets and million of nonrecurring level assets at june includes million of recurring level assets and million of nonrecurring level assets at december includes million of assets measured on a recurring basis and million of assets measured on a nonrecurring basis at june includes million of assets measured on a recurring basis and million of assets measured on a nonrecurring basis at december significant changes in fair value for level assets and liabilities during the first quarter of we sold certain loans which were transferred to held for sale during and were level assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis see note loans held for sale in the accompany consolidated financial statements for additional information see note fair value measurements in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information on additions to and transfers into out of level measurements during the three and six months ended june and as well as for further details including the classification hierarchy associated with assets and liabilities measured at fair value effect of changes in significant unobservable inputs the fair value of certain financial instruments is measured using valuation techniques that incorporate pricing assumptions not supported by derived from or corroborated by observable market data the resultant fair value measurements are dependent on unobservable input parameters which can be selected from a range of estimates and may be interdependent changes in one or more of the significant unobservable input parameters may change the fair value measurements of these financial instruments for the purpose of preparing the financial statements the final valuation inputs selected are based on managements best judgment that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing similar assets or liabilities the unobservable input parameters selected are subject to the internal valuation control processes and procedures when we perform a test of all the significant input parameters to the extreme values within the range at the same time it could result in an increase of the overall fair value measurement of approximately million or a decrease of the overall fair value measurement of approximately million at june the effect of changes in significant unobservable input parameters are primarily driven by the uncertainty in determining the fair value of certain creditlinked structured notes hsbc usa inc risk management overview managing risk effectively is fundamental to the delivery of our strategic priorities we use a comprehensive risk management framework across the organization and across all risk types underpinned by our risk culture this framework fosters continuous monitoring promotes risk awareness and encourages sound operational and strategic decisionmaking it also ensures a consistent approach to identifying assessing managing and reporting the risks we accept and incur in our activities our board of directors has the ultimate responsibility for effective oversight of risk management it is advised on risk matters by the risk committee of the board of directors notably risk appetite and its alignment with our strategy risk governance and internal controls as well as highlevel risk related matters robust risk governance and accountability are embedded throughout our business through an established framework that helps to ensure appropriate oversight of and accountability for the effective management of risk our material risks the principal risks associated with our operations include the following credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract treasury risk is the risk of having insufficient capital liquidity or funding resources to meet financial obligations and satisfy regulatory requirements including pension risk treasury risk also includes the risk to our earnings due to changes in market interest rates market risk is the risk that movements in market factors such as foreign exchange rates interest rates credit spreads equity prices and commodity prices will reduce our income or the value of our portfolios resilience risk is the risk that we are unable to provide critical services to our customers affiliates and counterparties as a result of sustained and significant operational disruption regulatory compliance risk is the risk that we fail to observe the letter and spirit of relevant laws codes rules regulations and standards of good market practice which as a consequence incur fines and penalties and suffer damage to our business financial crime risk is the risk that we knowingly or unknowingly help parties to commit or to further potentially illegal activity including money laundering fraud bribery and corruption tax evasion sanctions breaches and terrorist and proliferation financing strategic risk is the risk that the business will fail to identify execute and react appropriately to opportunities andor threats arising from changes in the market some of which may emerge over a number of years such as changing economic and political circumstances customer requirements demographic trends regulatory developments or competitor action and model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from business decisions informed by models which can be exacerbated by errors in methodology design or the way they are used in the course of our regular risk management activities we use models to help quantify the risk we are taking we believe that the assumptions used in these models are reasonable within the parameters for which the models have been built and calibrated to operate but events may unfold differently than what is assumed in the models consequently actual results may differ significantly from model projections the severe projections of macroeconomic variables during the covid19 pandemic and subsequent recovery represent events outside the parameters for which the models have been built as a result adjustments to model outputs to reflect consideration of management judgment are used with stringent governance in place to ensure appropriate results where models do not require adjustments enhanced model monitoring confirms models are performing as intended see risk management in mda in our form 10k for a more complete discussion of the objectives of our risk

balance sheet and using security sales or secured borrowings for liquidity stress situations in our liquidity contingency plans in addition regulations require banks to retain a portfolio of hqla as such we are maintaining a large portfolio of high quality sovereign and sovereign guaranteed securities hsbc usa inc our ability to regularly attract wholesale funds at a competitive cost is enhanced by strong ratings from the major credit ratings agencies the following table reflects the short and longterm credit ratings of hsbc usa and hsbc bank usa at june moodys sp fitch hsbc usa shortterm borrowings p1 a2 f1 longtermsenior debt a1 a a hsbc bank usa shortterm borrowings p1 a1 f1 longtermsenior debt aa3 a aa rating agencies continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends regulatory developments future profitability risk management practices and legal matters all of which could lead to adverse ratings actions although we closely monitor and strive to manage factors influencing our credit ratings there is no assurance that our credit ratings will not change in the future at june none of the ratings on the debt of hsbc usa or hsbc bank usa from any of the rating agencies were under review for potential downgrade see liquidity and capital resources in this mda for further discussion of our liquidity position including additional information regarding our outstanding borrowings the remaining availability of our debt issuance programs and our funding strategy interest rate risk various techniques are utilized to quantify and monitor risks associated with the repricing characteristics of our assets liabilities and derivative contracts see risk management in mda in our form 10k for a more complete discussion of our approach to interest rate risk economic value of equity eve eve represents the present value of the banking book cash flows that could be provided to our equity holder under a managed runoff scenario an eve sensitivity represents the change in eve due to a defined movement in interest rates we manage to an immediate parallel upward shock of basis points and an immediate parallel downward shock of basis points to the market implied interest rates at both june and december our eve remained within risk limits for the up and down basis point interest rate shock scenarios net interest income simulation modeling techniques we utilize simulation modeling to monitor a number of interest rate scenarios for their impact on projected net interest income these techniques simulate the impact on projected net interest income under various scenarios such as rate shock scenarios which assume immediate market rate movements by basis points as well as scenarios in which rates gradually rise or fall by basis points over a twelve month period in the gradual scenarios percent of the interest rate movement occurs at the beginning of each quarter the following table reflects the impact on our projected net interest income of the scenarios utilized by these modeling techniques june december amount amount dollars are in millions estimated increase decrease in projected net interest income reflects projected rate movements on july and january respectively resulting from a gradual basis point increase in the yield curve resulting from a gradual basis point decrease in the yield curve other significant scenarios monitored reflects projected rate movements on july and january respectively resulting from an immediate basis point increase in the yield curve resulting from an immediate basis point decrease in the yield curve the projections do not take into consideration possible complicating factors such as the effect of changes in interest rates on the credit quality size and composition of the balance sheet therefore although this provides a reasonable estimate of interest rate sensitivity actual results will differ from these estimates possibly by significant amounts market risk management exposure to market risk is separated into two portfolios trading portfolios comprise positions arising from marketmaking and warehousing of clientderived positions nontrading portfolios comprise positions that primarily arise from the interest rate management of our retail and commercial banking assets and liabilities and financial investments classified as availableforsale and heldtomaturity hsbc usa inc we apply similar risk management policies and measurement techniques to both trading and nontrading portfolios our objective is to manage and control market risk exposures to optimize return on risk while maintaining a market profile consistent with our established risk appetite see risk management in mda in our form 10k for a more complete discussion of our approach to market risk value at risk var var is a technique for estimating potential losses on risk positions as a result of movements in market rates and prices over a specified time horizon and to a given level of confidence the use of var is integrated into market risk management and calculated for all trading positions regardless of how we capitalize them in addition we calculate var for nontrading portfolios to have a complete picture of risk var measures are calculated to a percent confidence level and use a oneday holding period trading portfolios trading var generates primarily from the mss segment of gbm portfolios comprise mainly foreign exchange products precious metals ie gold silver platinum and credit default swaps the following graph summarizes daily var for our trading portfolios at a percent confidence level in millions the following table summarizes our trading var for the six months ended june and at december credit spread foreign exchange and commodity interest rate portfolio diversification total in millions at june six months ended june average maximum minimum at december portfolio diversification is the market risk dispersion effect of holding a portfolio containing different risk types it represents the reduction in unsystematic market risk that occurs when combining a number of different risk types for example foreign exchange interest rate and credit spread together in one portfolio it is measured as the difference between the sum of the var by individual risk type and the combined total var a negative number represents the benefit of portfolio diversification as the maximum and minimum occur on different days for different risk types it is not meaningful to calculate a portfolio diversification benefit for these measures the total var is nonadditive across risk types due to diversification effects for presentation purposes portfolio diversification of the var for trading portfolios includes varbased risknotinvar backtesting we routinely validate the accuracy of our var models by backtesting them against hypothetical profit and loss that excludes nonmodeled items such as fees commissions and revenues of intraday transactions from the actual reported profit and loss we would expect under stable market conditions to see two or three losses in excess of var at the percent confidence level over a oneyear period however in periods of unstable market conditions we could see an increase in the number of backtesting exceptions during the three months ended june we experienced six loss backtesting exceptions due primarily to significant increases in market volatility in the second quarter of these loss exceptions were driven by substantial market volatility in interest rates and metals arising from inflationary pressures changes in the frbs stance on interest rate hikes and geopolitical conditions performance of the var model was in line with expectations given observed market movements during the period market risk exposures and actual reported losses remained within the entitys risk limits hsbc usa inc nontrading portfolios nontrading var predominantly relates to markets treasury and represents the potential negative changes in the investment portfolio market value which includes availableforsale and heldtomaturity assets and associated hedges our investment portfolio holdings comprise mainly us treasury us government agency mortgagebacked and us government sponsored mortgagebacked securities our nontrading var exposure is driven by interest rates and agency spread volatility the following table summarizes our nontrading var for the six months ended june and at december credit spread interest rate portfolio diversification total in millions at june six months ended june average maximum minimum at december refer to the trading var table above for additional information nontrading var also includes the interest rate risk of nontrading financial assets and liabilities held by the global businesses and transfer priced into markets treasury which has the mandate to centrally manage and hedge it see treasury risk management above for a broader discussion on how interest rate risk is managed hsbc usa inc consolidated
