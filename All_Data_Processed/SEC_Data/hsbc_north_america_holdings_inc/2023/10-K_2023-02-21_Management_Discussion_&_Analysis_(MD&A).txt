the parameters for which the models have been built and calibrated to operate but events may unfold differently than what is assumed in the models in actual stressed market conditions these assumptions and relationships may no longer hold causing actual experience to differ from the results predicted in the model the severe projections of macroeconomic variables during the covid19 pandemic and subsequent recovery represent events outside the parameters for which the models have been built as a result adjustments to model outputs to reflect consideration of management judgment are used with stringent governance in place to ensure appropriate results where models do not require adjustments enhanced model monitoring confirms models are performing as intended key developments in we actively managed the risks related to the russiaukraine war and broader macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties during in addition we enhanced our risk management in the following areas we continued to improve our risk governance decision making particularly with regard to the governance of treasury risk to ensure senior executives have appropriate oversight and visibility of macroeconomic trends around inflation and interest rates we continued to develop our approach to emerging risk identification and management including the use of forwardlooking indicators to support our analysis we enhanced our enterprise risk reporting processes to place a greater focus on our emerging risks including by capturing the materiality oversight and individual monitoring of these risks we continued to develop our climate risk management capabilities and embed climate considerations throughout our business our material risks the principal risks associated with our operations include the following credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract treasury risk is the risk of having insufficient capital liquidity or funding resources to meet financial obligations and satisfy regulatory requirements including the risk of an adverse impact on earnings due to changes in market interest rates together with pension risk market risk is the risk of an adverse financial impact on trading activities arising from changes in market parameters such as interest rates foreign exchange rates asset prices volatilities correlations and credit spreads climate risk relates to the financial and nonfinancial impacts that may arise as a result of climate change and the move to a greener economy resilience risk is the risk that we are unable to provide critical services to our customers affiliates and counterparties as a result of sustained and significant operational disruption regulatory compliance risk is the risk associated with breaching our duty to clients and other counterparties inappropriate market conduct and breaching related financial services regulatory standards financial crime risk is the risk of knowingly or unknowingly helping parties to commit or to further potentially illegal activity including money laundering fraud bribery and corruption tax evasion sanctions breaches and terrorist and proliferation financing strategic risk is the risk that the business will fail to identify execute and react appropriately to opportunities andor threats arising from changes in the market some of which may emerge over a number of years such as changing table start hsbc usa inc table end economic and political circumstances customer requirements demographic trends regulatory developments or competitor action and model risk is the risk of inappropriate or incorrect business decisions arising from the use of models that have been inadequately designed implemented or used or from models that do not perform in line with expectations and predictions credit risk management credit risk is managed through a robust risk identification and control framework which outlines clear and consistent policies principles and guidance for risk managers credit risk is monitored using various internal risk management measures and within limits approved by individuals within a framework of delegated authorities the principle objectives of credit risk management are to maintain a strong culture of responsible lending and robust risk policies and control frameworks both partner with and challenge our businesses in defining implementing and continually reevaluating our risk appetite under actual and scenario conditions and ensure there is independent scrutiny of credit risks their cost and their mitigation credit risk arises from various on and offbalance sheet instruments and arrangements such as loan portfolios investment portfolios unfunded commitments such as letters of credit and lines of credit and unutilized credit card lines that customers can draw upon and derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps which may represent an exposure to the counterparty to the contract while credit risk exists widely in our operations diversification among various commercial and consumer portfolios helps to lessen risk exposure daytoday management of credit risk is performed by the chief credit officer and the wpb chief risk officer who report directly to the cro and maintain independent risk functions the credit risk associated with wholesale commercial portfolios is managed by the chief credit officer while credit risk associated with retail consumer loan portfolios is managed by the wpb chief risk officer further discussion of credit risk can be found under the credit quality caption in this mda our credit risk management procedures are designed for all stages of economic and financial cycles including challenging periods of market volatility and economic uncertainty the credit risk function continues to refine early warning indicators and reporting including stress testing scenarios on the basis of recent experience stress testing results are taken into consideration within our business planning process action has been taken where necessary to improve our resilience to risks associated with the current market conditions by selectively discontinuing business lines or products closely managing underwriting criteria and investing in improved fraud prevention technologies at december the future economic environment remains uncertain amidst slowing economic growth persistently high inflation rising interest rates global supply chain stress continued geopolitical issues and increasing recession concerns we continue to monitor the performance of our material commercial loans as conditions evolve and take necessary credit actions where warranted our credit risk exposure to russia was immaterial at december the responsibilities of the credit risk function include formulating credit risk policies our policies are designed to ensure that all of our various retail and wholesale business units operate within clear standards of acceptable credit risk our policies ensure that the hsbc standards are consistently implemented across all businesses and that all regulatory requirements are also considered credit policies are reviewed and approved annually at the rmm and the risk committee of the board of directors approving new credit exposures and independently assessing large exposures annually credit approval authorities are delegated by the board of directors to the ceo and subsequently subdelegated to the cro with the authority to subdelegate to the chief credit officer and wpb chief risk officer the chief credit officer and wpb chief risk officer in turn delegate limited credit authority to the various lending units however most wholesale credits are reviewed and approved centrally through a dedicated credit approval unit that reports directly to the chief credit officer in addition the chief credit officer coordinates the review of material credits with hsbc group credit risk which subject to certain agreedupon limits will concur on material new and renewal transactions large retail credits are escalated to the wpb chief risk officer for review and concurrence overseeing retail credit and collateral risk the wpb chief risk officer manages the credit and collateral risk associated with retail portfolios supported by expertise from a dedicated advanced risk analytics unit collateral risk in retail arises when the underlying value of the property securing a retail loan loses value due to macroeconomic housing market or industry conditions this risk is actively managed through ongoing monitoring of house price table start hsbc usa inc table end indices in the metropolitan statistical areas in which the mortgage portfolio is concentrated in areas where property values are declining maximum ltv requirements will be adjusted downward to compensate for this risk maintaining and developing the governance and operation of the wholesale risk rating system a twodimensional credit risk rating system is utilized in order to categorize exposures meaningfully and enable focused management of the risks involved this rating system comprises a category customer risk rating which considers the probability of default of an obligor and a separate facility risk rating representing an assessment of the obligors expected performance in servicing its obligations in accordance with the terms rating methodologies are based upon a wide range of analytics and market databased tools which are core inputs to the assessment of counterparty risk although automated risk rating processes are increasingly used for larger facilities the ultimate responsibility for setting risk ratings rests in each case with the final approving executive risk ratings are reviewed frequently and amendments where necessary are implemented promptly measuring portfolio credit risk we continue to advance the measurement of the risk in our credit portfolios using techniques such as stress testing in certain internal reporting efforts continue to refine both the inputs and assumptions used to increase the usefulness in the evaluation of large and small commercial and retail customer portfolio products and business unit return on risk monitoring portfolio performance credit data warehouses have been implemented to centralize the reporting of credit risk support the analysis of risk and to calculate credit loss reserves this data warehouse also supports hsbcs wider effort to meet the requirements of basel iii and to generate credit reports for management and the risk committee of the board of directors establishing counterparty and portfolio limits we monitor and limit our wholesale exposure to individual counterparties and to the combined exposure of related counterparties in addition selected industry portfolios such as real estate are subject to caps that are recommended by the chief credit officer and reviewed where appropriate by management committees and the risk committee of the board of directors retail establishes portfolio limits by product as well as limits on new products and higherrisk segments such as investment property high ltv mortgages and credit cards these limits are approved by the wpb chief risk officer and monitored by a retail credit risk management committee counterparty credit exposure related to derivative activities is also managed under approved limits since the exposure related to derivatives is variable and uncertain internal risk management methodologies are used to calculate the percent worstcase potential future exposure for each customer these methodologies take into consideration among other factors crossproduct closeout netting collateral received from customers under collateral support annexes termination clauses and offsetting positions within the portfolio managing problem loans special attention is paid to problem loans when appropriate our wholesale special credits unit and retail collection and recovery teams provide customers with intensive management and support in order to help them avoid default wherever possible and maximize recoveries establishing allowances for credit losses the chief credit officer and the wpb chief risk officer share responsibility with the chief financial officer for establishing appropriate levels of allowances for credit losses inherent in our various loan and other portfolios carried at amortized cost this responsibility includes overseeing the processes for model performance monitoring and redevelopment of new models establishing forwardlooking economic scenarios projecting results from the impairment calculation engine and determining management judgment utilized for estimating lifetime ecl management review committees comprising representatives from credit risk and finance have been established in order to review and challenge the results of the lifetime ecl calculations before approving them each period credit review is an independent and critical second lod function its mission is to identify and evaluate areas of credit risk within our business credit review will focus on the review and evaluation of wholesale and retail lending activities and will identify risks and provide an ongoing assessment as to the effectiveness of the risk management framework and the related portfolios credit review will independently assess the business units and risk management functions to ensure the portfolios are managed and operating in a manner that is consistent with hsbc group strategy risk appetite appropriate local and hsbc group credit policies and procedures and applicable regulatory requirements for example this includes the unilateral authority to independently assess and revise customer risk ratings facility risk ratings and loss given default estimates to ensure its independent stature the credit review delegation of authority is endorsed by the risk committee of the board of directors which grants the head of credit review unhindered access to the risk committee and executive sessions at the discretion of the head of credit review accordingly our risk committee of the board of directors has oversight of the credit review annual and ongoing plan quarterly plan updates and results of reviews treasury risk management treasury risk arises from changes to the respective resources and risk profiles driven by customer behavior management decisions or the external environment treasury risks including capital liquidity and funding and interest rate risk are owned and actively managed on an ongoing basis by the treasurer supported by alco table start hsbc usa inc table end capital risk is the risk that we fail to meet our regulatory capital requirements capital risk arises from a deterioration in the capital base due to losses and increased risk profile from management activity or the external environment we aim to maintain a strong capital base to support the risks inherent in our business and invest in accordance with our strategy meeting regulatory capital requirements at all times see liquidity and capital resources in this mda for a full discussion of our approach to capital risk management including our capital ratios and regulatory capital requirements liquidity and funding risk is the risk that we do not have sufficient financial resources to meet our obligations as they fall due or that we cannot raise funding or can only do so at excessive cost liquidity and funding risk arises from mismatches in the timing of cash flows or when illiquid asset positions cannot be funded at the expected terms and when required we continuously monitor the impact of market events on our liquidity positions and will continue to adapt our liquidity and funding framework to reflect market events and the evolving regulatory landscape and view as to best practices historically we have seen the greatest strain in the wholesale market as opposed to the retail market the latter being the market from which we source stable demand and time deposit accounts which are less sensitive to market events or changes in interest rates liquidity is managed to provide the ability to generate cash to meet lending deposit withdrawal and other commitments at a reasonable cost in a reasonable amount of time while maintaining routine operations and market confidence market funding is coordinated with other hsbc group entities as the markets increasingly view debt issuances from the separate companies within the context of our common parent company liquidity and funding risk management is performed at the hsbc north america hsbc usa and hsbc bank usa levels each entity is required to have sufficient liquidity for a crisis situation liquidity risk policies and procedures have been implemented to ensure that the minimum liquidity ratios and a strong overall liquidity position are maintained alco projects cash flow requirements and determines the level of liquid assets and available funding sources to have at our disposal with consideration given to anticipated deposit and balance sheet growth contingent liabilities and the ability to access wholesale funding markets in addition to base case projections multiple stress scenarios are generated to simulate crisis conditions including runoff of nonstable deposits inability to renew maturing interbank funding drawdowns of committed loan facilities decreases in the market value of liquid securities additional collateral requirements for derivative transactions under existing collateral support agreements rating downgrades of hsbc usa or hsbc bank usa and increased discount on security values for repos or disposals in addition alco monitors the overall mix of deposit and funding concentrations to avoid undue reliance on individual funding sources and large deposit relationships as part of our approach towards liquidity and funding risk management we employ the measures discussed below to define monitor and control our liquidity and funding risk in accordance with hsbc policy as of january hsbc north america met the criteria to be reclassified as a category iv firm and as a result of this classification change hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa are subject to a further reduced us liquidity coverage ratio lcr and net stable funding ratio nsfr requirement of percent so long as hsbc north americas weighted shortterm wholesale funding equals or exceeds billion hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa elected to report subject to the reduced us lcr and nsfr requirement of percent beginning april whereas they were previously subject to the requirement of percent applicable under the category iii standards hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa are subject to the us lcr rule which is designed to be a shortterm liquidity measure to ensure banks have sufficient high quality liquid assets hqla to cover net stressed cash outflows over the next days and are required to report their lcr to us regulators on a daily basis under the tailoring rules a percent lcr requirement applies to category iv firms with weighted shortterm wholesale funding that equals or exceeds billion and their depository institution subsidiaries as a result a lcr of percent or higher reflects an unencumbered hqla balance that is equal to or exceeds percent of a category iv firms liquidity needs for a calendar day liquidity stress scenario hqla consists of cash or assets that can be converted into cash at little or no loss of value in private markets during hsbc bank usas lcr remained above the percent minimum requirement beginning in the third quarter of we removed the united kingdom uk prudential regulatory authority pra based lcr from our reporting as we no longer employ that ratio as part of our approach towards liquidity risk management hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa are also subject to the us nsfr rule which is a longer term liquidity measure with a 12month time horizon to ensure a sustainable maturity structure of assets and liabilities under the tailoring rules a percent nsfr requirement applies to category iv firms with weighted shortterm wholesale funding that equals or exceeds billion and their depository institution subsidiaries as a result a nsfr of percent or more reflects an available stable table start hsbc usa inc table end funding balance from liabilities and capital over the next months that is equal to or exceeds percent of a category iv firms required amount of funding for assets and offbalance sheet exposures at both december and hsbc bank usas nsfr exceeded percent in addition the uk pra based nsfr took effect on january at both december and hsbc usas nsfr under the uk pra nsfr rule exceeded percent the ratio at december was estimated based on our interpretation and understanding of the basel committee nsfr guidance at that time under the uk pra nsfr rule a nsfr of percent or more reflects an available stable funding balance from liabilities and capital over the next months that is equal to or exceeds the required amount of funding for assets and offbalance sheet exposures as a category iv firm hsbc north america remains subject to liquidity stress testing and related liquidity buffer and liquidity risk management requirements hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa have liquidity profiles to support compliance with these rules and may need to make changes to their liquidity profiles to support compliance with any future rules alco also maintains a liquidity management and contingency funding plan contingency funding plan which identifies certain potential early warning indicators of liquidity problems and actions that can be taken both initially and in the event of a liquidity crisis to minimize the longterm impact on our businesses and customer relationships the contingency funding plan is reviewed annually and approved by the risk committee of the board of directors we recognize a liquidity crisis can either be specific to us relating to our ability to meet our obligations in a timely manner or marketwide caused by a macro risk event in the broader financial system a range of indicators are monitored to attain an early warning of any liquidity issues these include widening of key spreads or indices used to track market volatility material reductions or extreme volatility in customer deposit balances increased utilization of credit lines widening of our own credit spreads and higher borrowing costs at the onset of a crisis liquidity needs would be satisfied primarily with unsecured wholesale market funding if the crisis escalates contingency funding needs will be satisfied primarily through sales of securities from the investment portfolio and secured borrowing using the mortgage portfolio as collateral securities may be sold or used as collateral in a repurchase agreement depending on the scenario portions of the mortgage portfolio may be used as collateral at the fhlb to increase borrowings we maintain a liquid asset buffer consisting of cash shortterm liquid assets and unencumbered government and other highly rated investment securities as a source of funding further collateral is maintained at the federal reserve bank discount window and the fhlb providing additional secured borrowing capacity in a liquidity crisis in addition to the oversight provided by alco treasury risk management trm is a second lod oversight function for treasury riskrelated activities including capital liquidity and funding and interest rate risk which is led by the head of traded and treasury risk management and risk analytics who is the accountable risk steward for treasury risks and independently reports into the cro trms primary mandate is to strengthen our treasury risk management framework through challenge and review of existing processes and recommending areas that need improvement to the rmm trm serves as an advisory function to senior management to ensure front line units with direct responsibility for managing treasury risk are operating within their operating guidelines and defined risk appetite parameters the trm oversight mandate is carried out through critical evaluation and challenge of existing risk management processes including stress testing and ratio calculations our liquidity and funding risk management approach includes deposits supplemented by wholesale borrowing to fund our balance sheet and using security sales or secured borrowings for liquidity stress situations in our liquidity contingency plans in addition regulations require banks to retain a portfolio of hqla as such we are maintaining a large portfolio of high quality sovereign and sovereign guaranteed securities our ability to regularly attract wholesale funds at a competitive cost is enhanced by strong ratings from the major credit ratings agencies the following table reflects the short

portfolios at december are expected to mature in the remaining million of debt securities not expected to mature in are available to provide liquidity by serving as collateral for secured borrowings or if needed by being sold further liquidity is available through our ability to sell or securitize loans in secondary markets in in addition to the normal sales of agencyeligible mortgage loan originations we sold loans of approximately million to third parties as part of our restructuring plan it is the policy of hsbc bank usa to maintain both primary and secondary collateral in order to ensure precautionary borrowing availability from the federal reserve bank primary collateral is collateral that is physically maintained at the federal reserve bank and serves as a safety net against any unexpected funding shortfalls that may occur secondary collateral is collateral that is acceptable to the federal reserve bank but is not maintained there if unutilized borrowing capacity were to be low secondary collateral would be identified and maintained as necessary further liquidity is available from the fhlb see liquidity and capital resources in this mda for further discussion of our liquidity position including additional information regarding our outstanding borrowings the remaining availability of our debt issuance programs and our funding strategy interest rate risk is the potential reduction of net interest income due to mismatched pricing between assets and liabilities as well as losses in value due to interest rate movements we are subject to interest rate risk associated with the repricing characteristics of our balance sheet assets and liabilities specifically as interest rates change amounts of interest earning assets and liabilities fluctuate and interest earning assets reprice at intervals that do not correspond to the maturities or repricing patterns of interest bearing liabilities this mismatch between assets and liabilities in repricing sensitivity results in changes to projected net interest income as interest rates move to help manage the risks associated with changes in interest rates and to manage net interest income within interest rate risk ranges management considers acceptable we use derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps options futures and forwards as hedges to modify the repricing characteristics of specific assets liabilities forecasted transactions or firm commitments analysis of this risk is complicated by having to make assumptions on embedded optionality within certain product areas such as the incidence of mortgage prepayments and from behavioral assumptions regarding the economic duration of liabilities which are contractually repayable on demand such as current accounts these assumptions around behavioral features are captured in our interest rate behavioralization framework which is described further below daytoday management of interest rate risk is centralized principally in markets treasury which includes the nontrading interest rate risk positions transferred to it from the global businesses as discussed further below we have significant but historically well controlled interest rate risk in large part due to our portfolio of residential mortgages and mortgagebacked securities which consumers can prepay without penalty and our large base of demand and savings deposits these deposits can be withdrawn by consumers at will but historically they have been a stable source of relatively low cost funds in addition we have a number of contracts referencing libor the process of adopting new reference rates may expose us to an increased level of financial risks such as potential earnings volatility see executive overview in this mda for a full discussion of our libor transition in the course of managing interest rate risk a combination of risk assessment techniques are utilized to identify and assess the potential impact of interest rate movements and take appropriate action this combination of techniques with some focusing on the impact of interest rate movements on the valuation of the balance sheet eg economic value of equity present value of a basis point repricing gap analysis value at risk and others focusing on the impact of interest rate movements on earnings eg net interest income simulation modeling allows for comprehensive analyses from different perspectives a key element of managing interest rate risk is the management of the convexity of the balance sheet largely resulting from the mortgage related products on the balance sheet convexity risk arises as mortgage loan consumers change their payment behavior significantly in response to large movements in market rates but do not change behavior appreciably for smaller changes in market rates certain interest rate management tools such as economic value of equity and net interest income simulation modeling better capture the embedded convexity in the balance sheet while measures such as present value of a basis point are designed to capture the risk of smaller changes in rates the assessment techniques discussed below act as a guide for managing interest rate risk associated with balance sheet composition and offbalance sheet hedging strategy the risk position calculated values within limit ranges reflect an acceptable risk position although possible future unfavorable trends may prompt adjustments to on or offbalance sheet table start hsbc usa inc table end exposure calculated values outside of limit ranges will result in consideration of adjustment of the risk position or consideration of temporary dispensation from making adjustments economic value of equity eve eve represents the present value of the banking book cash flows that could be provided to our equity holder under a managed runoff scenario an eve sensitivity represents the change in eve due to a defined movement in interest rates we manage to an immediate parallel upward shock of basis points and an immediate parallel downward shock of basis points to the market implied interest rates at both december and our eve remained within risk limits for the up and down basis point interest rate shock scenarios repricing gap analysis the following table shows the repricing structure of our assets and liabilities at december for assets and liabilities whose cash flows are subject to change due to movements in interest rates such as the sensitivity of mortgage loans to prepayments data is reported based on the earlier of expected repricing or maturity and reflects anticipated prepayments based on the current rate environment the resulting gaps are reviewed to assess the potential sensitivity to earnings with respect to the direction magnitude and timing of

risks associated with the repricing characteristics of our assets liabilities and derivative contracts table start hsbc usa inc table end net interest income simulation modeling techniques we utilize simulation modeling to monitor a number of interest rate scenarios for their impact on projected net interest income these techniques simulate the impact on projected net interest income under various scenarios such as rate shock scenarios which assume immediate market rate movements by basis points as well as scenarios in which rates gradually rise or fall by basis points over a twelve month period in the gradual scenarios percent of the interest rate movement occurs at the beginning of each quarter the following table reflects the impact on our projected net interest income of the scenarios utilized by these modeling techniques table start december december amount amount dollars are in millions estimated increase decrease in projected net interest income reflects projected rate movements on january and respectively resulting from a gradual basis point increase in the yield curve resulting from a gradual basis point decrease in the yield curve other significant scenarios monitored reflects projected rate movements on january and respectively resulting from an immediate basis point increase in the yield curve resulting from an immediate basis point decrease in the yield curve table end projected net interest income sensitivity figures represent the effect of movements in net interest income based on the projected yield curve scenarios and our current interest rate risk profile this effect however does not incorporate actions which would probably be taken by markets treasury or in the businesses to mitigate the effect of interest rate risk in reality markets treasury seeks proactively to change the interest rate risk profile to minimize losses and optimize net revenues the net interest income simulation modeling calculations assume that interest rates of all maturities move by the same amount in the upshock scenarios the sensitivity calculations in the downshock scenarios reflect no floors to the shocked market rates however customer productspecific rate floors are recognized where appropriate in addition the net interest income simulation modeling calculations take account of the effect on net interest income of anticipated differences in changes between interbank interest rates and interest rates over which the entity has discretion in terms of the timing and extent of rate changes the projections do not take into consideration possible complicating factors such as the effect of changes in interest rates on the credit quality size and composition of the balance sheet therefore although this provides a reasonable estimate of interest rate sensitivity actual results will differ from these estimates possibly by significant amounts interest rate risk behavioralization unlike liquidity risk which is assessed on the basis of a very severe stress scenario interest rate risk is assessed and managed according to businessasusual conditions in many cases the contractual profile of our assets and liabilities does not reflect the behavior observed behavioralization is therefore used to assess the interest rate risk of our assets and liabilities and this assessed risk is transferred to markets treasury in accordance with the rules governing the transfer of interest rate risk from the global businesses to markets treasury behavioralization is applied in three key areas the assessed repricing frequency of managed rate balances the assessed duration of noninterest bearing balances typically capital and current accounts and the base case expected prepayment behavior or pipeline takeup rate for fixed rate balances with embedded optionality interest rate behavioralization policies have to be formulated in line with the hsbc groups behavioralization policies and approved at least annually by alco and global asset liability and capital management in conjunction with local regional and hsbc group risk monitoring teams the extent to which balances can be behavioralized is driven by the amount of the current balance that can be assessed as stable under businessasusual conditions and for managed rate balances the historic market interest rate repricing behavior observed or for noninterest bearing balances the duration for which the balance is expected to remain under businessasusual conditions this assessment is often driven by the reinvestment tenors available to markets treasury to neutralize the risk through the use of fixed rate government bonds or interest rate derivatives and for derivatives the availability of cash flow hedging capacity nontrading value at risk var nontrading var predominantly relates to markets treasury and represents the potential negative changes in the investment portfolio market value which includes availableforsale and heldtomaturity

nontrading financial assets and liabilities held by the global businesses and transfer priced into markets treasury which has the mandate to centrally manage and hedge it interest rate swaps used by markets treasury to hedge the interest rate risk of the investment portfolio and transfer price risk from the banking book are typically classified as either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge and included within our nontrading var in case there is residual market risk that cannot be efficiently and conveniently hedged by markets treasury they are managed by alco in segregated alco books pension risk is a component of treasury risk and represents the risk of increased costs from offering postemployment benefit plans to our employees certain employees are eligible to participate in the hsbc north america qualified defined benefit pension plan which has been frozen plan assets were higher than projected plan liabilities resulting in an overfunded status of approximately million at december because these obligations relate to the hsbc north america pension plan only a portion of any future deficit could be considered our responsibility we and other hsbc north america affiliates with employees participating in this plan will be required to make up any shortfall over a number of years as specified under the pension protection act this can be accomplished through direct contributions appreciation in plan assets andor increases in marketdriven discount rates resulting in lower liability valuations see note pension and other postretirement benefits in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information concerning the hsbc north america defined benefit plan market risk management exposure to market risk is separated into two portfolios trading portfolios comprise positions arising from marketmaking and warehousing of clientderived positions nontrading portfolios comprise positions that primarily arise from the interest rate management of our retail and commercial banking assets and liabilities and financial investments classified as availableforsale and heldtomaturity we apply similar risk management policies and measurement techniques to both trading and nontrading portfolios our objective is to manage and control market risk exposures to optimize return on risk while maintaining a market profile consistent with our established risk appetite the nature of the hedging and risk mitigation strategies performed corresponds to the market risk management instruments available these strategies range from the use of traditional market instruments such as interest rate swaps to more sophisticated hedging strategies to address a combination of risk factors arising at the portfolio level market risk governance market risk is managed and controlled through limits approved by the risk committee of the board of directors and the rmm as well as the various businesses and also ratified by the hsbc group risk management meeting these limits are allocated across business lines and to the hsbc group legal entities including hsbc usa and hsbc bank usa table start hsbc usa inc table end we have an independent market risk management and control function in north america which is responsible for setting the risk appetite measuring market risk exposures in accordance with the policies defined by hsbc group risk and monitoring and reporting these exposures against the prescribed limits on a daily basis model risk is governed through model oversight committees at the regional and global levels the committees have direct oversight and approval responsibility for all traded risk models utilized for risk measurement and management and stress testing they prioritize the development of models methodologies and practices used for traded risk management and ensure that they remain within our risk appetite and business plans we are committed to the ongoing development and enhancement of our inhouse risk models subject to regulatory approval refer to model risk management below for further discussion regarding the management and monitoring of model risk across north america our control of market risk in the trading and nontrading portfolios is based on a policy of restricting operations to trading within a list of permissible instruments ultimately approved by hsbc group risk as well as enforcing new product approval procedures through a dedicated committee market risk measures we use a range of tools to monitor and limit market risk exposures including sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis measures the impact of individual market factor movements on specific instruments or portfolios for example the impact of a one basis point change in the yield curve we use sensitivity analysis to monitor the market risk positions within each risk type sensitivity limits are set for portfolios products and risk types with the depth of the market being one of the principal factors in determining the level of limits set value at risk var var is a technique for estimating potential losses on risk positions as a result of movements in market rates and prices over a specified time horizon and to a given level of confidence the use of var is integrated into market risk management and calculated for all trading positions regardless of how we capitalize them in addition we calculate var for nontrading portfolios to have a complete picture of risk where we do not calculate var explicitly we use alternative tools as summarized in the stress testing section below our var models are predominantly based on historical simulation which incorporates the following features historical market rates and prices are calculated with reference to foreign exchange rates commodity prices interest rates and the associated volatilities potential market movements utilized for var are calculated with reference to data from the past two years scenario profit and losses are calculated utilizing the market scenarios for all relevant risk factors and var measures are calculated to a percent confidence level and use a oneday holding period the models also incorporate the effect of option features on the underlying exposures the nature of the var models means that an increase in observed market volatility will lead to an increase in var without any changes in the underlying positions although a valuable guide to risk var should always be viewed in the context of its limitations for example the use of historical data as a proxy for estimating future events may not encompass all potential events particularly those which are extreme in nature the use of a holding period assumes that all positions can be liquidated or the risks offset during that period which may not fully reflect the market risk arising at times of severe illiquidity when the holding period may be insufficient to liquidate or hedge all positions fully the use of a percent confidence level does not take into account losses that might occur beyond this level of confidence and var is calculated on the basis of exposures outstanding at the close of business and therefore does not necessarily reflect intraday exposures the risks not in var rniv framework aims to capture and capitalize material market risks that are not adequately covered in the var model risk factors are reviewed on a regular basis and either incorporated directly in the var models where possible or quantified through the rniv rniv stresses interest rate basis risk exposure and interest rate volatility skewness rniv riskweighted assets make up approximately percent of husi market risk riskweighted assets though contribution to total husi riskweighted assets remains immaterial stressed var stressed var is primarily used for regulatory capital purposes and is integrated into the risk management process to facilitate efficient capital management stressed var complements other risk measures by providing severe potential losses associated with stressed market conditions stressed var modeling follows the same approach as var except stressed var calculates potential loss at a percent confidence level for a oneday holding period based on a one year historical period that is calibrated to the most volatile period for the trading portfolio table start hsbc usa inc table end stress testing stress testing is an important procedure that is integrated into our market risk management framework to evaluate the potential impact on portfolio values of more extreme although plausible events or movements in a set of financial variables in such scenarios losses can be much greater than those predicted by var modeling a set of scenarios is used consistently across the hsbc group scenarios are tailored to capture the relevant potential events or market movements at each level the risk appetite around potential stress losses is set and monitored against corresponding limits the process is governed by the stress testing review group forum which in conjunction with regional risk management determines the scenarios to be applied main scenario types are as follows single risk factor stress scenarios that are unlikely to be captured within the var models such as the break of a currency peg technical scenarios that incorporate the largest move in each risk factor independent from any underlying market correlation hypothetical scenarios are mainly built on potential macroeconomic events for example a worsening global energy crisis and the potential effects of a sovereign debt default including its wider contagion effects curves steepening or flattening scenarios and historical scenarios which incorporate past observations of market movements during periods of stress which are not captured within var market risk reverse stress tests are undertaken on the premise that there is a fixed loss the stress testing process identifies which scenarios lead to this loss the rationale behind the reverse stress test is to understand scenarios which are beyond normal business conditions and could have contagion and systemic implications stressed var and stress testing together with reverse stress testing provide management with insights regarding the tail risk beyond var for which our appetite is limited market risk in the global market environment was characterized by a slowdown in global economic growth exasperated by chinas strict covid19 policy and continued increases in inflation which only began to show signs of moderation toward the end of the year following large and repeated interest rate hikes by the frb and other central banks during the year there was an increase in market volatility driven by tightening of monetary policy in order to fight inflation the russiaukraine war and other geopolitical tensions also contributed to volatility in the markets for the year trading var trading var is generated principally from trading activities within the mss segment of gbm these include positions in foreign exchange precious metals ie gold silver platinum and credit default swaps trading var at december was relatively flat as compared with december as mss continued to focus on customer facilitation and credit portfolio management the following graph summarizes daily var for our trading portfolios at a percent confidence level in millions table start hsbc usa inc table end the following table summarizes our trading var for and table start credit spread foreign exchange and commodity interest rate portfolio diversification total in millions at december full year average maximum minimum at december full year average maximum minimum table end table start table end portfolio diversification is the market risk dispersion effect of holding a portfolio containing different risk types it represents the reduction in unsystematic market risk that occurs when combining a number of different risk types for example foreign exchange interest rate and credit spread together in one portfolio it is measured as the difference between the sum of the var by individual risk type and the combined total var a negative number represents the benefit of portfolio diversification as the maximum and minimum occur on different days for different risk types it is not meaningful to calculate a portfolio diversification benefit for these measures the total var is nonadditive across risk types due to diversification effects for presentation purposes portfolio diversification of the var for trading portfolios includes varbased risknotinvar refer to treasury risk management above for disclosure of our nontrading var backtesting we routinely validate the accuracy of our var models by backtesting them against hypothetical profit and loss that excludes nonmodeled items such as fees commissions and revenues of intraday transactions from the actual reported profit and loss we would expect under stable market conditions to experience two or three losses in excess of var at the percent confidence level over a oneyear period however in periods of unstable market conditions we could see an increase in the number of backtesting exceptions during we experienced seven loss backtesting exceptions six exceptions in the second quarter and one exception in the third quarter were due primarily to significant increases in market volatility driven by substantial volatility in interest rates and metals arising from inflationary pressures changes in the frbs stance on interest rate hikes and geopolitical conditions given the heightened number of hypothetical loss backtesting exceptions in the second quarter of we have undertaken a review of our var model assumptions and updated risk parameters within the model during the period market risk exposures and actual reported losses remained within the entitys risk limits stressed var the following table reflects stressed var at december and table start at december in millions stressed var 1day equivalent table end stressed var at december was higher as compared with december driven by an increase of inventory in precious metals products climate risk management climate risk can materialize through physical risk transition risk and climaterelated greenwashing risk physical risk arises from the increased frequency and severity of weather events such as hurricanes and floods or chronic shifts in weather patterns transition risk arises from the process of moving to a lowcarbon economy including changes in government or public policy technology and enddemand climaterelated greenwashing risk is a thematic risk that arises from the act of knowingly or unknowingly misleading stakeholders regarding our strategy relating to climate the climate impactbenefits of a product or service or the climate commitments or performance of our customers a climate risk working group was established in to identify and escalate climate risk issues to the cro the rmm and to the risk committee of the board of directors climate risk management matters are governed principally through the rmm and the risk committee of the board of directors the rmm has a standing agenda item for climate risk topics table start hsbc usa inc table end we have integrated climate risk into our existing risk taxonomy and are incorporating it within the risk management framework through policies and controls for the existing risks where appropriate our climate risk approach is aligned to our risk management framework and three lod model which sets out how we identify assess and manage our risks this approach ensures the board of directors and senior management have visibility and oversight of our key climate risks our dedicated climate risk program continues to support the development of our climate risk management capabilities the key achievements in included updating our climate risk management approach to cover all risk types in our risk taxonomy expanding the scope of climaterelated training for employees to cover additional topics such as greenwashing risk and increased the availability of training to the broader workforce and developing new metrics to monitor climate risk exposure climate risk should be considered part of the broader sustainability risks that also cover risks related to social and governance issues the hsbc group has specific sustainability risk policies covering thermal coal phaseout agricultural commodities chemicals defense energy forestry mining and metals unesco world heritage sites and ramsardesignated wetlands the hsbc group also applies the equator principles when financing projects in december the hsbc group updated its energy policy covering oil and gas power and utilities hydrogen renewables nuclear and biomass the policy is a key mechanism to reduce the financed emissions of the hsbc groups energy portfolio and help clients transition to lowcarbon alternatives the hsbc group will continue to engage with clients where relevant and support them in an effort to adopt more sustainable practices our network of sustainability risk managers support the implementation of these policies these sustainability risk managers are supported by reputational and sustainability risk professionals across the hsbc group resilience risk management resilience risk arises from failures or inadequacies in processes people systems or external events operational resilience is our ability to anticipate prevent adapt respond to recover and learn from internal or external disruption protecting customers the markets we operate in and their economic stability resilience is measured by assessing whether we are able to continue to provide our most important services within an agreed tolerance during a severe but plausible event we accept that we will not be able to prevent all disruption but we prioritize investment to continuously improve our response and recovery capability for our most important business services the operational and resilience risk subfunction provides robust nonfinancial risk steward oversight of our businesses functions and critical business services supported by effective and timely independent challenge it provides guidance and stewardship about how we can prevent adapt and learn from resiliencerelated threats when something goes wrong the operational and resilience risk target operating model provides a consistent view across resilience risks strengthening our risk management oversight while operating effectively as part of a simplified nonfinancial risk structure we view resilience risk across several risk types related to failure to manage third parties technology and cybersecurity transaction processing failure to protect people and places from physical malevolent acts business interruption and incident risk data risk change execution risk building unavailability and workplace safety the operational and resilience risk structure simplifies interactions with our key stakeholders by providing specialist skill and a single channel of contact and actively challenges the business and delivers clear consistent and credible responses ensuring controls are being operated and risks are being managed we continue to prioritize our efforts on material risks and areas undergoing strategic growth we deploy risk management oversight to the most material change programs across the organization and we ensure we have specialist risk teams inplace to provide expert oversight and guidance for highly technical areas of risk management operational and resilience risk matters are governed principally through the rmm and the risk committee of the board of directors technology and cybersecurity risk the security of our information and technology infrastructure is crucial for maintaining our applications and processes while protecting our customers and the hsbc brand in common with other financial institutions and multinational organizations we face a growing threat of cyberattacks that continue to increase in sophistication a failure of our defenses against such attacks could result in financial loss or the loss of customer data or other sensitive information which could undermine both our reputation and our ability to attract and retain our customers as discussed above cybersecurity risk is overseen by the operational and resilience risk subfunction with regular reporting of cyber risks to the rmm and the board of directors by both the first and second lod we experienced cyberattacks in none of which resulted in material financial loss we continue to mature our cyber intelligence capabilities as the cyber threat landscape evolves these intelligence monitoring capabilities increase our agility and ability to respond with increased detection and response capabilities reducing potential exposure to cyber threats regulators have listed cybersecurity as one of their top concerns in regulation continues to increase from multiple jurisdictions and perspectives and is at times deployed without coordination with other regulators hsbc is engaged with peer institutions and in conjunction with them and the cyber risk institute cri developed a cri profile previously known as a financial services profile which is recognized within the united states and globally as part of this forum we continue to meet with various us regulators eg the occ frb fdic commodity futures trading commission new york state department of financial services etc and other financial table start hsbc usa inc table end institutions to progress acceptance and utilization of the cri profile to address regulatory harmonization as it relates to cyber and information security cybersecurity will continue to be a strong focus of ongoing initiatives to strengthen the control environment and our readiness to respond in the event of an attack regulatory compliance risk management regulatory compliance risk arises from the failure to observe relevant laws codes rules and regulations and can manifest itself in poor market or customer outcomes and lead to fines penalties and reputational damage to our business regulatory compliance risk is measured by reference to identified metrics key risk indicators testing of controls by the three lines of defense employee feedback customer complaints and through regulatory feedback regulatory compliance risks are assessed through detailed assessments and reported to the rmm and the risk committee of the board of directors through the reporting of ras metrics and the regulatory compliance enterprise risk assessment report regulatory compliance risk is managed by establishing and communicating appropriate policies and procedures training employees in regulatory requirements establishing controls and monitoring and testing controls to help ensure that the regulatory requirements are being adhered to proactive assessment and enhancement of controls is undertaken where required the second lod risk stewards provide independent objective oversight and challenge and promote a complianceoriented culture supporting the businesses in delivering fair outcomes for customers maintaining the integrity of financial markets and achieving our strategic objectives any actual or potential regulatory breaches require prompt identification and escalation to the regulatory compliance function or other applicable risk stewards any major breaches gaps issues and emerging risks are escalated to the rmm and the risk committee of the board of directors as appropriate the compliance function oversees the management of regulatory compliance risk for laws codes rules regulations and standards that align under its scope of oversight as the second lod risk steward as a board of directors committee the risk committee oversees our compliance risk management program both regulatory compliance and financial crime risk as well as fiduciary matters as discussed further below fiduciary risk is a component of regulatory compliance risk and represents the risk of breaching fiduciary duties where we act in a fiduciary capacity as trustee investment manager or as mandated by law or regulation it is the risk associated with failing to offer services honestly and properly to clients in that capacity fiduciary risks reside in our wpb businesses such as investment management personal trust security operation services and other business lines outside of wpb such as corporate trust the risk committee of the board of directors has oversight responsibility of the management of fiduciary risk the risk committee has delegated daytoday management and oversight responsibilities to management whose primary oversight body for management of fiduciary activity is the fiduciary risk management meeting chaired by the us head of enterprise compliance the us head of enterprise compliance reports to the us chief compliance officer financial crime risk management financial crime risk management is the framework in place to identify and deter potential illegal activity from occurring by at or through the hsbc group it is embedded in our daytoday operations and culture the financial crime function fc is led by the us head of financial crime who reports to the us chief compliance officer fc provides oversight to enable us to build on our achievements in managing financial crime risk effectively and to continue to strengthen financial crime detection and antimoney laundering sanctions fraud tax evasion and antibribery and corruption compliance we use a financial crime risk management information dashboard the ras risk map and top and emerging risk process to monitor risk and performance indicators of financial crime including trends and potential gaps in the management of financial crime risk that require attention on an annual basis we perform an enterprisewide risk assessment of financial crime any major breaches gaps issues and emerging risks are escalated to the rmm and the risk committee of the board of directors as appropriate compliance continues to proactively identify analyze and investigate financial crime risk and ensure proper mitigation of these risks it embeds policies and procedures introduces new technology solutions and supports a culture of compliance needed to effectively manage financial crime risk strategic risk management strategic risk may be mitigated by consideration of the potential opportunities and challenges through the strategic planning process this risk is also a function of the compatibility of our strategic goals the business strategies developed to achieve those goals the resources deployed against those goals and the quality of implementation we have established a strong internal control structure to minimize the impact of strategic risk to our earnings and capital all changes in strategy as well as the process in which new strategies are implemented are subject to detailed reviews and approvals at business line functional regional board and hsbc levels this process is monitored by the strategy and planning function to ensure compliance with our policies and standards reputational risk is a component of strategic risk and represents the risk arising from failure to meet stakeholder expectations as a result of any event behavior action or inaction either by us our employees the hsbc group or those with whom it is associated that may cause stakeholders to form a negative view of us reputational risk relates to stakeholders perceptions whether based on fact or otherwise stakeholder expectations are constantly changing and thus reputational risk is dynamic and will differ between geographies groups and individuals this might also result in financial or nonfinancial impacts loss of table start hsbc usa inc table end confidence or other consequences the safeguarding of our reputation is of paramount importance to our continued prosperity and is the responsibility of every member of our staff reputational risk can arise from social ethical or environmental issues or as a consequence of operational and other risk events our good reputation depends upon the way in which we conduct our business but can also be affected by the way in which customers to whom we provide financial services conduct themselves we tolerate a limited degree of reputational risk arising from business activities or association where foreseeable reputational risk has been escalated to the appropriate level of management carefully considered andor mitigated and is determined to fall to acceptable risk thresholds as defined by the hsbc group risk appetite statement since reputational risk can arise from all aspects of operations and activities all businesses and functions are required to articulate and track reputational risk reputational risk is considered and assessed by the hsbc group executive committee the hsbc group and senior management the risk committee of the board of directors reviews with senior management and as appropriate approves guidelines and policies related to the process for assessing and managing risk topics including reputational risk these policies which are an integral part of the internal control systems are communicated through manuals and statements of policy internal communication and training the policies form the basis for operational procedures as well as consideration of reputational risk in areas including money laundering deterrence economic sanctions environmental impact anticorruption measures employee relations inappropriate market conduct and breach of regulatory duty and requirements in addition we continue to review our internal control structure to minimize the risk of operational and financial failure and to ensure that a full appraisal of reputational risk is made before strategic decisions are taken the rmm provides governance and oversight of reputational risk additionally each business reviews transactions and customers that may adversely affect our public perception via their rrcsc the rrcscs are chaired by a senior executive and comprise senior members from the business risk legal financial crime and compliance departments and other invited parties the rrcscs are responsible for reviewing the individual
