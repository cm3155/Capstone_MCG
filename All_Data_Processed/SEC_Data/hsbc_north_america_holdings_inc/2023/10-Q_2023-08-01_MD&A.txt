our economic environment the us economy grew during the first half of despite continued pressures from high inflation and rising interest rates which are expected to lead to a slowdown of future economic growth in addition bank failures earlier in the year have raised concerns about potential weakness in the banking sector which could lead to tighter credit conditions for households and businesses further weighing on economic activity us gross domestic product gdp grew at an estimated annual rate of percent in the second quarter of while the personal consumption expenditures price index of percent in june remained above the frbs target inflation rate after increasing shortterm interest rates by a total of basis points during the first five months of the frb decided to hold shortterm interest rates steady in june while indicating that future rate increases are likely depending upon future economic conditions in july the frb decided to raise shortterm interest rates by another basis points the impacts of high inflation rising interest rates and the expectation for slowing future economic growth in addition to recent banking sector concerns have created significant uncertainty about the future economic environment which will continue to impact our business in future periods concerns over domestic and global policy issues trade policy in the us and geopolitical events as well as the implications of those events on the markets in general further add to the global uncertainty there is also a risk that interest rate increases to fight inflation could lead to a recession interest rate levels inflation and economic growth in combination with global economic conditions fiscal and monetary policy and the level of regulatory and government scrutiny of financial institutions will continue to impact our results in and beyond performance developments and trends during the first half of three regional bank failures triggered turmoil throughout the banking industry as contagion fears spread to date we have not experienced any significant impact to our liquidity deposits or funding capabilities as a result of this industry turmoil in may the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic issued a proposed rule that would impose a special assessment on certain fdicinsured banks including hsbc bank usa to recover the loss to the deposit insurance fund arising from the protection of uninsured depositors following a determination of systemic risk in connection with the failures of silicon valley bank and signature bank the special assessment would be based on an insured depository institutions estimated uninsured deposits reported as of december and would be collected over eight quarterly assessment periods beginning with the first quarter of if finalized as proposed the special assessment is expected to result in approximately million of additional deposit insurance assessment fees for husi which will be accrued once the rule becomes final which may occur as early as the third quarter of because the estimated loss to the deposit insurance fund will be periodically adjusted as actual losses are incurred the fdic would retain the ability to cease collection early or extend the special assessment collection period as needed during the second quarter of we transferred certain commercial real estate loans to held for sale with a carrying value of million as part of an effort to reduce exposure to this sector we recorded a lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment of million upon transferring these loans to held for sale see

million during the three and six months ended june respectively compared with million and million during the three and six months ended june respectively the increase in income before income tax during the three months ended june was due to higher other revenues driven by higher trading revenue as well as lower operating expenses and a lower provision for credit losses these increases in the threemonth period were partially offset by lower net interest income as interest expense on deposits and interest bearing liabilities grew faster than interest income on loans and interest bearing assets in the yeartodate period the increase in income before income tax was due to lower operating expenses driven by the completion of our strategic plan to restructure our operations restructuring plan including the nonrecurrence of million of costs related to the delivery of our restructuring plan costs to achieve recorded during the six months ended june as discussed further below also contributing to the increase in the yeartodate period were higher other hsbc usa inc revenues driven by higher trading revenue and a lower provision for credit losses these increases in the yeartodate

accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap group reporting basis we report financial information to hsbc in accordance with hsbc group accounting and reporting policies which apply international financial reporting standards ifrss as issued by the iasb as a result our segment results are prepared and presented using financial information prepared on the basis of hsbc groups accounting and reporting policies group reporting basis because operating results on the group reporting basis are used in managing our businesses and rewarding performance of employees our

before tax group reporting basis the significant differences between us gaap and the group reporting basis as they impact our results are summarized in note business segments in our form 10k there have been no significant changes since december in the differences between us gaap and the group reporting basis impacting our results differences in reported profit before tax in the table above that were individually significant for the periods presented are explained below during the three and six months ended june other longlived assets in the table above reflects a reversal of million of impairment charges under the group reporting basis related to capitalized software and leasehold improvements primarily associated with our wealth and personal banking business segment which were previously writtenoff in we recorded an impairment charge under the group reporting basis related to the writeoff of all the capitalized hsbc usa inc software and a portion of the leasehold improvements primarily associated with our wealth and personal banking business segment while under us gaap no impairment charge was required subsequent to recognition of the impairment charge in expenditures for software development and newly completed leasehold improvements in our wealth and personal banking business segment were capitalized and amortized over their useful lives under us gaap but not under the group reporting basis consequently the carrying amounts of capitalized software and leasehold improvements were higher under us gaap than under the group reporting basis and as a result corresponding amortization expense was higher under us gaap during the second quarter of we determined that the cash generating unit was no longer impaired under the group reporting basis and that its estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value which resulted in the reestablishment of these assets at their recoverable amount net of amortization that would have been recorded had no impairment loss been recognized and excluding any assets that have since been sold in addition during the first half of we recorded million of lease related impairment charges under us gaap associated with the exit of certain office space while under the group reporting basis impairment was recognized when we committed to vacate the space in the fourth quarter of during the three and six months ended june amortization expense for longlived assets was higher under us gaap due primarily to the impact of the impairment charge recorded under the group reporting basis in as discussed above during the three and six months ended june we transferred certain loans to held for sale which under us gaap requires the loans to be carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value which resulted in lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustments on the loans under the group reporting basis loans held for sale continue to be accounted for and credit losses continue to be measured in accordance with ifrs financial instruments with any gain or loss recorded at the time of sale during the three and six months ended june expected credit losses were higher under us gaap than under the group reporting basis under the group reporting basis a majority of our loans are considered to be in stage which requires a 12month expected credit losses estimate while under us gaap such loans require a lifetime expected credit losses ecl estimate primarily as a result of the different requirements loss provisions driven by the weakening of economic conditions including a worsening of economic forecasts in the threemonth period as well as higher provisions associated with loan growth and maturity extensions were more pronounced under us gaap balance sheet review the following table provides

contract is a function of a number of variables such as volatility of interest rates currencies equity or corporate reference entity used as the basis for determining contract payments current market events or trends country risk maturity and liquidity of contracts creditworthiness of the counterparties in the transaction the existence of a master netting agreement among the counterparties and existence and value of collateral received from counterparties to secure exposures the table below presents total credit risk exposure calculated using the general riskbased capital rules of the basel iii standardized approach which includes the net positive marktomarket of the derivative contracts plus any adjusted potential future exposure as measured in reference to the notional amount the regulatory capital rules recognize that bilateral netting agreements reduce credit risk and therefore allow for reductions of riskweighted assets when netting requirements have been met and collateral exists as a result riskweighted amounts for regulatory capital purposes are a portion of the original gross exposures furthermore many contracts contain provisions that allow us to close out the transaction if the counterparty fails to post required collateral in addition many contracts give us the right to break the transactions earlier than the final maturity date as a result these contracts have potential future exposures that are often much smaller than the future exposures derived from the regulatory capital rules june december in millions risk associated with derivative

comment period through at least november and would not be effective until july certain aspects of the proposal would be subject to a threeyear phasein period we are analyzing the proposed changes including the timing of implementation to determine the potential effects on capital requirements based on the foregoing we expect an increase in the capital requirements of hsbc north america hsbc

these arrangements arise principally in connection with our lending and client intermediation activities and involve primarily commitments to extend credit and in certain cases guarantees commitments to extend credit include arrangements whereby we are contractually obligated to extend credit in the form of loans participations in loans or similar transactions at june and december we had commitments to extend credit totaling billion and billion respectively comprised primarily of commercial commitments and to a lesser extent consumer commitments commercial commitments comprise primarily those related to secured and unsecured loans and lines of credit consumer commitments comprise unused mastercardvisa credit card lines where we have the right to change terms or conditions upon notification to the customer and commitments to extend credit secured by residential properties where we have the right to change terms or conditions for cause upon notification to the customer for a summary of guarantees including standby letters of credit and certain credit derivative transactions as well as the contractual amounts outstanding at june and december see note guarantee arrangements pledged asset and repurchase agreements in the accompanying consolidated financial statements the contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent our maximum possible credit exposure in the event that a counterparty draws down the full commitment amount or we are required to fulfill our maximum obligation under a guarantee hsbc usa inc many of these commitments and guarantees expire unused or without default as a result we believe that the contractual amount is not representative of the actual future credit exposure or funding requirements our offbalance sheet arrangements also include transactions with unconsolidated variable interest entities vies see note variable interest entities in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of these unconsolidated vies fair value fair value hierarchy fair value measurement accounting principles establish a fair value hierarchy structure that prioritizes the inputs to determine the fair value of an asset or liability the fair value framework the fair value framework distinguishes between inputs that are based on observed market data and unobservable inputs that reflect market participants assumptions it emphasizes the use of valuation methodologies that maximize observable market inputs for financial instruments carried at fair value the best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an actively traded market level where the market for a financial instrument is not active valuation techniques are used the majority of our valuation techniques use market inputs that are either observable or indirectly derived from and corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the financial instrument level because level and level instruments are determined by observable inputs less judgment is applied in determining their fair values in the absence of observable market inputs the financial instrument is valued based on valuation techniques that feature one or more significant unobservable inputs level the determination of the level of fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement of an asset or a liability is classified often requires judgment and may change over time as market conditions evolve we consider the following factors in developing the fair value hierarchy whether the asset or liability is transacted in an active market with a quoted market price the level of bidask spreads a lack of pricing transparency due to among other things complexity of the product and market liquidity whether only a few transactions are observed over a significant period of time whether the pricing quotations differ substantially among independent pricing services whether inputs to the valuation techniques can be derived from or corroborated with market data and whether significant adjustments are made to the observed pricing information or model output to determine the fair value level inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that the reporting entity has the ability to access for identical assets or liabilities a financial instrument is classified as a level measurement if it is listed on an exchange or is an instrument actively traded in the overthecounter otc market where transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume we regard financial instruments such as debt securities equity securities and derivative contracts listed on the primary exchanges of a country to be actively traded nonexchangetraded instruments classified as level assets include securities issued by the us treasury tobeannounced securities noncallable securities issued by us government sponsored enterprises and certain foreign governmentbacked debt level inputs are those that are observable either directly or indirectly but do not qualify as level inputs we classify mortgage passthrough securities agency and certain nonagency mortgage collateralized obligations nonexchangetraded derivative contracts assetbacked securities obligations of us states and political subdivisions corporate debt securities certain foreign governmentbacked debt preferred securities securities purchased and sold under resale and repurchase agreements precious metals certain loans held for sale certain student loans residential mortgage loans whose carrying amount was reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral real estate owned and certain client share repurchase transactions as level measurements where possible at least two quotations from independent sources are obtained based on transactions involving comparable assets and liabilities to validate the fair value of these instruments we have established a process to understand the methodologies and inputs used by the third party pricing services to ensure that pricing information meets the fair value objective and where appropriate this pricing data is backtested to market trade executions where significant differences arise among the independent pricing quotes and the internally determined fair value we investigate and reconcile the differences if the investigation results in a significant adjustment to the fair value the instrument will be classified as level within the fair value hierarchy in general we have observed that there is a correlation between the credit standing and the market liquidity of a nonderivative instrument level derivative instruments are generally valued based on discounted future cash flows or an option pricing model adjusted for counterparty credit risk and market liquidity the fair value of certain derivative products is determined using valuation techniques based on inputs derived from observable indices traded in the otc market appropriate control processes and hsbc usa inc procedures have been applied to ensure that the derived inputs are applied to value only those instruments that share similar risks to the relevant benchmark indices and therefore demonstrate a similar response to market factors level inputs are unobservable estimates that management expects market participants would use to determine the fair value of the asset or liability that is level inputs incorporate market participants assumptions about risk and the risk premium required by market participants in order to bear that risk we develop level inputs based on the best information available in the circumstances at june and december our level measurements included the following certain structured deposits and structured notes for which the embedded derivatives have significant unobservable inputs eg volatility or default correlations certain assetbacked securities individually assessed commercial loans mortgage servicing rights derivatives with certain inputs which are unobservable certain credit default swaps certain loans held for sale and swap agreements entered into in conjunction with the sales of visa class b shares for which the fair value is dependent upon the final resolution of the related litigation see note fair value measurements in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on level inputs level measurements the following table provides information about level assetsliabilities in relation to total assetsliabilities measured at fair value at june and december june december  are in millions level assets total assets measured at fair value level liabilities total liabilities measured at fair value level assets as a percent of total assets measured at fair value level liabilities as a percent of total liabilities measured at fair value presented without netting which allows the offsetting of amounts relating to certain contracts if certain conditions are met includes million of recurring level assets and million of nonrecurring level assets at june includes million of recurring level assets and million of nonrecurring level assets at december includes million of assets measured on a recurring basis and million of assets measured on a nonrecurring basis at june includes million of assets measured on a recurring basis and million of assets measured on a nonrecurring basis at december significant changes in fair value for level assets and liabilities see note fair value measurements in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information on additions to and transfers into out of level measurements during the three and six months ended june and as well as for further details including the classification hierarchy associated with assets and liabilities measured at fair value effect of changes in significant unobservable inputs the fair value of certain financial instruments is measured using valuation techniques that incorporate pricing assumptions not supported by derived from or corroborated by observable market data the resultant fair value measurements are dependent on unobservable input parameters which can be selected from a range of estimates and may be interdependent changes in one or more of the significant unobservable input parameters may change the fair value measurements of these financial instruments for the purpose of preparing the financial statements the final valuation inputs selected are based on managements best judgment that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing similar assets or liabilities the unobservable input parameters selected are subject to the internal valuation control processes and procedures when we perform a test of all the significant input parameters to the extreme values within the range at the same time it could result in an increase of the overall fair value measurement of approximately million or a decrease of the overall fair value measurement of approximately million at june the effect of changes in significant unobservable input parameters are primarily driven by the uncertainty in determining the fair value of certain creditlinked structured notes and swap agreements entered into in conjunction with the sales of visa class b shares risk management overview the primary role of risk management is to protect our customers business colleagues and the communities that we serve while ensuring we are able to support our strategy and provide sustainable growth we aim to use a comprehensive risk management approach across the organization and across all risk types underpinned by our culture and values this is outlined in our risk management framework including the key principles and practices that we employ in managing material risks both financial and nonfinancial this framework fosters continuous monitoring promotes hsbc usa inc risk awareness and encourages sound operational and strategic decisionmaking and escalation processes it also supports a consistent approach to identifying assessing managing and reporting the risks we accept and incur in our activities with clear accountabilities our board of directors has the ultimate responsibility for the effective oversight of risk management and approves our risk appetite it is advised on risk matters by the risk committee of the board of directors notably risk appetite and its alignment with our strategy risk governance and internal controls as well as highlevel risk related matters we use a defined executive risk governance structure to help ensure there is appropriate oversight and accountability embedded throughout our business for the effective management of risk our material risks the principal risks associated with our operations include the following credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract treasury risk is the risk of having insufficient capital liquidity or funding resources to meet financial obligations and satisfy regulatory requirements including the risk of an adverse impact on earnings due to changes in market interest rates together with pension risk market risk is the risk of an adverse financial impact on trading activities arising from changes in market parameters such as interest rates foreign exchange rates asset prices volatilities correlations and credit spreads climate risk relates to the financial and nonfinancial impacts that may arise as a result of climate change and the move to a greener economy resilience risk is the risk that we are unable to provide critical services to our customers affiliates and counterparties as a result of sustained and significant operational disruption regulatory compliance risk is the risk associated with breaching our duty to clients and other counterparties inappropriate market conduct and breaching related financial services regulatory standards financial crime risk is the risk of knowingly or unknowingly helping parties to commit or to further potentially illegal activity including money laundering fraud bribery and corruption tax evasion sanctions breaches and terrorist and proliferation financing strategic risk is the risk that the business will fail to identify execute and react appropriately to opportunities andor threats arising from changes in the market some of which may emerge over a number of years such as changing economic and political circumstances customer requirements demographic trends regulatory developments or competitor action and model risk is the risk of inappropriate or incorrect business decisions arising from the use of models that have been inadequately designed implemented or used or from models that do not perform in line with expectations and predictions in the course of our regular risk management activities we use models to help quantify the risk we are taking we believe that the assumptions used in these models are reasonable within the parameters for which the models have been built and calibrated to operate but events may unfold differently than what is assumed in the models adjustments to model outputs to reflect consideration of management judgment are used with stringent governance in place to ensure appropriate results where models do not require adjustments enhanced model monitoring

deposits supplemented by wholesale borrowing to fund our balance sheet and using security sales or secured borrowings for liquidity stress situations in our liquidity contingency plans in addition regulations require banks to retain a portfolio of hqla as such we are maintaining a large portfolio of high quality sovereign and sovereign guaranteed securities our ability to regularly attract

shock of basis points to the market implied interest rates at both june and december our eve remained within risk limits for the up and down basis point interest rate shock scenarios net interest income simulation modeling techniques we utilize simulation modeling to monitor a number of interest rate scenarios for their impact on projected net interest income these techniques simulate the impact on projected net interest income under various scenarios such as rate shock scenarios which assume immediate market rate movements by basis points as well as scenarios in which rates gradually rise or fall by basis points over a twelve month period in the gradual scenarios percent of the interest rate movement occurs at the beginning of each quarter the following table reflects the impact on our projected net interest income of the scenarios utilized by these modeling techniques june december amount amount dollars are in millions estimated increase decrease in projected net interest income reflects projected rate movements on july and january respectively resulting from a gradual basis point increase in the yield curve resulting from a gradual basis point decrease in the yield curve other significant scenarios monitored reflects projected rate movements on july and january respectively resulting from an immediate basis point increase in the yield curve resulting from an immediate basis point decrease in the yield curve the projections do not take into consideration possible complicating factors such as the effect of changes in interest rates on the credit quality size and composition of the balance sheet therefore although this provides a reasonable estimate of interest rate sensitivity actual results will differ from these estimates possibly by significant

the market risk dispersion effect of holding a portfolio containing different risk types it represents the reduction in unsystematic market risk that occurs when combining a number of different risk types for example foreign exchange interest rate and credit spread together in one portfolio it is measured as the difference between the sum of the var by individual risk type and the combined total var a negative number represents the benefit of portfolio diversification as the maximum and minimum occur on different days for different risk types it is not meaningful to calculate a portfolio diversification benefit for these measures the total var is nonadditive across risk types due to diversification effects for presentation purposes portfolio diversification of the var for trading

them against hypothetical profit and loss that excludes nonmodeled items such as fees commissions and revenues of intraday transactions from the actual reported profit and loss we would expect under stable market conditions to experience two or three losses in excess of var at the percent confidence level over a oneyear period however in periods of unstable market conditions we could see an
