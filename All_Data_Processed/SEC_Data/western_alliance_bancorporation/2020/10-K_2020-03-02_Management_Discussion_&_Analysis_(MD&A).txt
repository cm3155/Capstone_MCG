by gaap the companys management uses these nongaap financial measures in their analysis of the companys performance these measurements typically adjust gaap performance measures to exclude the effects of certain activities or transactions that in managements opinion do not reflect recurring periodtoperiod comparisons of the companys performance management believes presentation of these nongaap financial measures provides useful supplemental information that is essential to a complete understanding of the operating results of the companys core businesses since the presentation of these nongaap performance measures and their impact differ between companies these nongaap disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with gaap nor are they necessarily comparable to nongaap performance measures that may be presented by other companies operating preprovision net revenue operating ppnr is defined by the federal reserve in sr which requires companies subject to the rule to project ppnr over the planning horizon for each of the economic scenarios defined annually by the regulators banking regulations define ppnr as net interest income plus noninterest income less noninterest expense management has further adjusted this metric to exclude any nonrecurring or nonoperational elements of noninterest income or noninterest expense which are outlined in the table below management believes that this is an important metric as it illustrates the underlying performance of the company enables investors and others to assess the companys ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through the credit cycle and provides consistent reporting with a key metric used by bank regulatory agencies the following table shows the components of operating ppnr for the years ended december and table start year ended december in thousands total noninterest income less gain loss on sales of investment securities net fair value gain

related to tangible common equity tangible common equity represents total stockholders equity less identifiable intangible assets and goodwill management believes that tangible common equity financial measures are useful in evaluating the companys capital strength financial condition and ability to manage potential losses in addition management believes that these measures improve comparability to

basel iii which includes common equity tier and total capital the frb and other banking regulators use common equity tier and total capital as a basis for assessing a banks capital adequacy therefore management believes it is useful to assess financial condition and capital adequacy using this same basis specifically the total capital ratio takes into consideration the risk levels of assets and offbalance sheet financial instruments in addition management believes that the classified assets to common equity tier plus allowance measure is an important regulatory metric for assessing asset quality table start december  in thousands common equity tier common equity less nonqualifying goodwill and intangibles disallowed deferred tax asset aoci related adjustments unrealized gain on

interest income interest expense and net interest margin the companys primary source of revenue is interest income for the year ended december interest income was billion an increase of million or compared to billion for the year ended december this increase was primarily the result of a billion increase in the average loan balance that drove a million increase in loan interest income for the year ended december interest income from investment securities increased by million for the comparable period primarily due to an increase in the average investment balance of million partially offset by a decrease in interest rates from december other interest income increased million from the comparable period due primarily to an increase in interestbearing cash account balances average yield on interest earning assets increased to for the year ended december compared to in which was primarily the result of increased yields on the companys interestbearing cash accounts for the year ended december interest expense was million compared to million for the year ended december interest expense on deposits increased million for the same period as average interestbearing deposits increased billion which was paired with a basis point increase in the average cost of interestbearing deposits interest expense on shortterm borrowings decreased by million as a result of a million decrease in average shortterm borrowings for the year ended december compared to the same period in interest expense on qualifying debt increased by million due to changes in related interest rate swap expense arising from fluctuations in interest rates for the year ended december net interest income was billion compared to million for the year ended december the increase in net interest income reflects a billion increase in average interest earning assets offset by a billion increase in average interestbearing liabilities the decrease in net interest margin of basis points compared to is the result of higher deposit and funding costs provision for credit losses the provision for credit losses on loans in each period is reflected as a reduction in earnings for that period the provision is equal to the amount required to maintain the allowance for credit losses at a level that is adequate to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio for the year ended december the provision for credit losses was million compared to million for the year ended december the decrease in the provision was primarily due to a reduction in net chargeoffs and loan mix the company may also establish an additional allowance for credit losses on pci loans through provision for credit losses when impairment is determined as a result of lower than expected cash flows as of december and the allowance for credit losses on pci loans was million for nonpci loans an additional allowance for credit losses is established when the remaining credit marks on these loans are lower than the

income for the year ended december compared to increased by million or the increase is due to sales of investment securities and fair value adjustments the net gain on sales of investment securities of million during the year ended december was the result of a portfolio rebalancing initiative the net loss on sales of investment securities of million during the year ended december relates to sales of low yielding investment securities which were replaced with investment securities with shorter durations and higher yields as well as losses on sales of equity securities the net fair value gain on assets measured at fair value was million for the year ended december compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december which resulted from changes in the fair market value of the companys equity securities other increases in noninterest income were due to increases in service charges and fees and other noninterest income the increase in service charges and fees of million is due to continued growth in the companys deposit base which increased billion during the year ended december the increase in other noninterest income of million is due primarily to an increase in rental income on equipment leases these increases were partially offset by a decrease in lending income of million due to fewer gains on the sale of loans compared to the same period in noninterest expense

consist of increases in data processing and occupancy of million and million respectively which relate to the companys support of its continued growth these increases were partially offset by a decrease in other noninterest expense of million which primarily relates to a nonrecurring charitable donation of million made in as well as a decrease in fdic insurance costs of million due to the elimination of the fdic assessment surcharge in the fourth quarter of the decrease in other noninterest expense was offset in part by a million increase in depreciation expense on leased equipment income taxes for the year s ended december and the companys effective tax rate was and respectively the increase in the effective tax rate from to is due primarily to managements decision during the third quarter of to carryback its federal nols the decrease in the effective tax rate from to is due primarily to the decrease in the federal statutory rate effective in a reduction in excise taxes

weighted average interest rate at end of year weighted average interest rate during year table end critical accounting policies the notes to the consolidated financial statements contain a discussion of the companys significant accounting policies including information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements adoption of such policies and the related impact of their adoption the company believes that certain of these policies along with various estimates that it is required to make in recording its financial transactions are important to have a complete understanding of the companys financial position in addition these estimates require management to make complex and subjective judgments many of which include matters with a high degree of uncertainty the following is a summary of these critical accounting policies and significant estimates allowance for credit losses credit risk is inherent in the business of extending loans and leases to borrowers for which the company must maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses is established through a provision for credit losses recorded to expense loans are charged against the allowance for credit losses when management believes that the contractual principal or interest will not be collected subsequent recoveries if any are credited to the allowance the allowance is an amount believed adequate to absorb estimated probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectable based on evaluation of the collectability of loans and prior credit loss experience together with other factors the company formally reevaluates and establishes the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses on a quarterly basis the allowance consists of specific and general components the specific allowance applies to impaired loans for impaired collateral dependent loans the reserve is calculated based on the collateral value net of estimated disposition costs generally the company obtains independent collateral valuation analysis for each loan over a specified dollar threshold every months loans not collateral dependent are evaluated based on the expected future cash flows discounted at the original contractual interest rate the general allowance covers all nonimpaired loans and incorporates several quantitative and qualitative factors which are used for all of the companys portfolio segments quantitative factors include companyspecific 10year historical net chargeoffs stratified by loans with similar characteristics qualitative factors include levels of and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans levels of and trends in chargeoffs and recoveries trends in volume and terms of loans changes in underwriting standards or lending policies experience ability depth of lending staff national and local economic trends and conditions changes in credit concentrations outofmarket exposures changes in quality of loan review system and changes in the value of underlying collateral due to the credit concentration of the companys loan portfolio in real estate secured loans the value of collateral is heavily dependent on real estate values in arizona nevada and california while management uses the best information available to make its evaluation future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if there are significant changes in economic or other conditions in addition regulators as an integral part of their examination processes periodically review the banks allowance for credit losses and may require the bank to make additions to the allowance based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examination management regularly reviews the assumptions and formulae used in determining the allowance and makes adjustments if required to reflect the current risk profile of the portfolio income taxes the companys income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect managements best estimate of current and future taxes to be paid the company is subject to federal and state income taxes in the united states significant judgments and estimates are required in the determination of the consolidated income tax expense deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future in evaluating the companys ability to recover its deferred tax assets in the jurisdictions from which they arise all available positive and negative evidence is considered including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities tax planning strategies projected future taxable income and recent operating results the assumptions about future taxable income require the use of significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying business liquidity liquidity is the ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals fund asset growth and business operations and meet contractual obligations through unconstrained access to funding at reasonable market rates liquidity management involves forecasting funding requirements and maintaining sufficient capacity to meet the needs and accommodate fluctuations in asset and liability levels due to changes in the companys business operations or unanticipated events the ability to have readily available funds sufficient to repay fully maturing liabilities is of primary importance to depositors creditors and regulators the companys liquidity represented by cash and amounts due from banks federal funds sold and nonpledged marketable securities is a result of the companys operating investing and financing activities and related cash flows in order to ensure that funds are available when necessary on at least a quarterly basis the company projects the amount of funds that will be required over a 12month period and it also strives to maintain relationships with a diversified customer base liquidity requirements can also be met through shortterm borrowings or the disposition of shortterm assets the following table presents the available and outstanding balances on the companys lines of credit table start december available balance outstanding balance in millions unsecured fed funds credit lines at correspondent banks table end in addition to lines of credit the company has borrowing capacity with the fhlb and frb from pledged loans and securities the borrowing capacity outstanding borrowings and available credit as of december are presented in the following table table start december in millions fhlb borrowing capacity outstanding borrowings letters of credit total available credit frb borrowing capacity outstanding borrowings total available credit table end the company has a formal liquidity policy and in the opinion of management its liquid assets are considered adequate to meet cash flow needs for loan funding and deposit cash withdrawals for the next days at december there is billion in liquid assets comprised of million in cash and cash equivalents and billion in unpledged marketable securities at december the company maintained billion in liquid assets comprised of million of cash cash equivalents and money market investments and billion in unpledged marketable securities the parent maintains liquidity that would be sufficient to fund its operations and certain nonbank affiliate operations for an extended period should funding from normal sources be disrupted since deposits are taken by wab and not by the parent parent liquidity is not dependent on the banks deposit balances in the companys analysis of parent liquidity it is assumed that the parent is unable to generate funds from additional debt or equity issuances receives no dividend income from subsidiaries and does not pay dividends to stockholders while continuing to make nondiscretionary payments needed to maintain operations and repayment of contractual principal and interest payments owed by the parent and affiliated companies under this scenario the amount of time the parent and its nonbank subsidiaries can operate and meet all obligations before the current liquid assets are exhausted is considered as part of the parent liquidity analysis management believes the parent maintains adequate liquidity capacity to operate without additional funding from new sources for over months wab maintains sufficient funding capacity to address large increases in funding requirements such as deposit outflows this capacity is comprised of liquidity derived from a reduction in asset levels and various secured funding sources on a longterm basis the companys liquidity will be met by changing the relative distribution of its asset portfolios for example by reducing investment or loan volumes or selling or encumbering assets further the company can increase liquidity by soliciting higher levels of deposit accounts through promotional activities andor borrowing from the fhlb of san francisco and the frb at december the companys longterm liquidity needs primarily relate to funds required to support loan originations commitments and deposit withdrawals which can be met by cash flows from investment payments and maturities and investment sales if necessary the companys liquidity is comprised of three primary classifications cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows used in investing activities and cash flows provided by financing activities net cash provided by or used in operating activities consists primarily of net income adjusted for changes in certain other asset and liability accounts and certain noncash income and expense items such as the provision for credit losses investment and other amortization and depreciation for the years ended december and net cash provided by operating activities was million million and million respectively the companys primary investing activities are the origination of real estate and commercial loans the collection of repayments of these loans and the purchase and sale of securities the companys net cash provided by and used in investing activities has been primarily influenced by its loan and securities activities the net increase in loans for the years ended december and was billion billion and billion respectively the net increase in investment securities for the years ended december and was million million and billion respectively net cash provided by financing activities has been impacted significantly by increased deposit levels during the years ended december and net deposits increased billion billion and billion respectively fluctuations in core deposit levels may increase the companys need for liquidity as certificates of deposit mature or are withdrawn before maturity and as nonmaturity deposits such as checking and savings account balances are withdrawn additionally the company is exposed to the risk that customers with large deposit balances will withdraw all or a portion of such deposits due in part to the fdic limitations on the amount of insurance coverage provided to depositors to mitigate the uninsured deposit risk the company participates in the cdars and ics programs which allow an individual customer to invest up to million and million respectively through one participating financial institution or a combined total of million per individual customer with the entire amount being covered by fdic insurance as of december the company has million of cdars and million of ics deposits as of december the company has billion of wholesale brokered deposits outstanding brokered deposits are generally considered to be deposits that have been received from a third party who is engaged in the business of placing deposits on behalf of others a traditional deposit broker will direct deposits to the banking institution offering the highest interest rate available federal banking laws and regulations place restrictions on depository institutions regarding brokered deposits because of the general concern that these deposits are not relationship based and are at a greater risk of being withdrawn and placed on deposit at another institution offering a higher interest rate thus posing liquidity risk for institutions that gather brokered deposits in significant amounts federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid the total amount of dividends that may be paid at any date is generally limited to the retained earnings of the bank dividends paid by wab to the parent would be prohibited if the effect thereof would cause the banks capital to be reduced below applicable minimum capital requirements during the year ended december wab and lvsp paid dividends to the parent of million and million respectively subsequent to december wab paid dividends to the parent of

doddfrank act significantly changed the financial regulatory regime in the united states since the enactment of the doddfrank act us banks and financial services firms have been subject to enhanced regulation and oversight several provisions of the doddfrank act are subject to further rulemaking guidance and interpretation by the federal banking agencies while the current administration and its appointees to the federal banking agencies have expressed interest in reviewing revising and perhaps repealing portions of the doddfrank act and certain of its implementing regulations is not clear whether any such legislation or regulatory changes will be enacted or if enacted what the effect on the company would be egrrcpa on may the president signed into law the egrrcpa which among other things amended certain provisions of the doddfrank act the egrrcpa provides limited regulatory relief to certain financial institutions while preserving the existing framework under which us financial institutions are regulated the egrrcpa relieves bank holding companies with less than billion in assets such as the company from the enhanced prudential standards imposed under section of the doddfrank act including but not limited to resolution planning and enhanced liquidity and risk management requirements in addition to amending the doddfrank act the egrrcpa also includes certain additional bankingrelated provisions consumer protection provisions and securities lawrelated provisions while many of the egrrcpas changes have been implemented through rules adopted by federal agencies the company expects to continue to evaluate the potential impact of the egrrcpa as it is further implemented bank holding company regulation wal is a bank holding company as defined under the bhca the bhca generally limits the business of bank holding companies to banking managing or controlling banks and other activities that the frb has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto business activities that have been determined to be related to banking and therefore appropriate for bank holding companies and their affiliates to engage in include securities brokerage services investment advisory services fiduciary services and certain management advisory and data processing services among others bank holding companies that have elected to become financial holding companies may engage in any activity or acquire and retain the shares of a company engaged in any activity that is either i financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity as determined by the frb in consultation with the secretary of the treasury or ii complementary to a financial activity and that does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally as solely determined by the frb activities that are financial in nature include securities underwriting and dealing insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments mergers and acquisitions the bhca the bank merger act and other federal and state statutes regulate the direct and indirect acquisition of depository institutions the bhca requires prior frb approval for a bank holding company to acquire directly or indirectly or more of any class of voting securities of a commercial bank or its parent holding company and for a company other than a bank holding company to acquire or more of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding company under the change in bank control act any person including a company may not acquire directly or indirectly control of a bank without providing days prior notice and receiving a nonobjection from the appropriate federal banking agency under the bank merger act the prior approval of the appropriate federal banking agency is required for insured depository institutions to merge or enter into purchase and assumption transactions in reviewing applications seeking approval of merger and purchase and assumption transactions the federal banking agencies will consider among other things the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions the capital position of the combined banking organization the applicants performance record under the cra and the effectiveness of the subject organizations in combating money laundering activities for further information relating to the cra see the section titled community reinvestment act and fair lending laws under section of the arizona revised statutes no person may acquire control of a company that controls an arizona bank without the prior approval of the arizona superintendent of financial institutions or arizona superintendent a person who has the power to vote or more of the voting stock of a controlling company is presumed to control the company enhanced prudential standards section of the doddfrank act imposes enhanced prudential standards on larger banking organizations with certain of these standards applicable to banking organizations over billion including wal and wab as of the quarter ending june in october the fdic the occ and the frb issued separate but similar rules requiring covered banks and bank holding companies with billion to billion in total consolidated assets to conduct an annual companyrun stress test wal and wab conducted a companyrun capital stress test as required by the doddfrank act in and provided the results to the frb wal found the company would have sufficient capital to maintain regulatory capital levels throughout an economic downturn as a result of passage of the egrrcpa bank holding companies with less than billion in assets such as the company are exempt from the enhanced prudential standards imposed under section of the doddfrank act including but not limited to the resolution planning and enhanced liquidity and risk management requirements therein notwithstanding these changes the capital planning and risk management practices of the company and the bank will continue to be reviewed through the regular supervisory processes of the frb in february the frb issued a rule further implementing the enhanced prudential standards required by the doddfrank act although most of the standards apply only to bank holding companies with more than billion in assets as directed by the doddfrank act the rule contains certain standards that apply to bank holding companies with more than billion in assets including a requirement to establish a risk committee of the companys bod to manage enterprisewide risk the company meets these requirements the egrrcpa increased the asset threshold for requiring a bank holding company to establish a separate risk committee of independent directors from billion to billion notwithstanding this change the company has retained its separate risk committee of independent directors volcker rule section of the doddfrank act commonly known as the volcker rule restricts the ability of banking entities such as the company and wab from i engaging in proprietary trading and ii investing in or sponsoring certain covered funds subject to certain limited exceptions under the volcker rule the term covered funds is defined as any issuer that would be an investment company under the investment company act but for the exemption in section 3c1 or 3c7 of that act which includes clo and cdo securities there are also several exemptions from the definition of covered fund including among other things loan securitizations joint ventures certain types of foreign funds entities issuing assetbacked commercial paper and registered investment companies further the final rules permit banking entities subject to certain conditions and limitations to invest in or sponsor a covered fund in connection with organizing and offering the covered fund certain riskmitigating hedging activities and de minimis investments in covered funds the egrrcpa and subsequent promulgation of interagency final rules have aimed at simplifying and tailoring requirements related to the volcker rule including by eliminating collection of certain metrics and reducing the compliance burdens associated with other metrics for banks with less than billion in average trading assets and liabilities compliance with the volcker rule was required by july and the company believes it is fully compliant dividends historically the company has not declared or paid cash dividends on its common stock electing instead to retain earnings for growth on july wals bod authorized the payment of regular quarterly dividends declaring the companys first quarterly cash dividend of per share of common stock which was paid on august whether the company continues to pay quarterly dividends and the amount of any such dividends will be at the discretion of wals bod and will depend on the companys earnings financial condition results of operations business prospects capital requirements regulatory restrictions contractual restrictions and other factors that the bod may deem relevant the companys ability to pay dividends is subject to the regulatory authority of the frb the supervisory concern of the frb focuses on a bank holding companys capital position its ability to meet its financial obligations as they come due and its capacity to act as a source of financial strength to its insured depository institution subsidiaries in addition frb policy discourages the payment of dividends by a bank holding company that is not supported by current operating earnings as a delaware corporation the company is also subject to limitations under delaware law on the payment of dividends under the delaware general corporation law dividends may only be paid out of surplus or out of net profits for the year in which the dividend is declared or the preceding year and no dividends may be paid on common stock at any time during which the capital of outstanding preferred stock or preference stock exceeds the companys net assets from time to time the company may become a party to financing agreements and other contractual obligations that have the effect of limiting or prohibiting the declaration or payment of dividends under certain circumstances holding company expenses and obligations with respect to its outstanding trust preferred securities and corresponding subordinated debt also may limit or impair the companys ability to declare and pay dividends since the company has no significant assets other than the voting stock of its subsidiaries it currently depends on dividends from wab and to a lesser extent its nonbank subsidiaries for a substantial portion of its revenue and as the primary sources of its cash flow the ability of a state member bank such as wab to pay cash dividends is restricted by the frb and the state of arizona the frbs regulation h states that a member bank may not declare or pay a dividend if the total of all dividends declared during that calendar year exceed the banks net income during that calendar year and the retained net income of the prior two years further without receiving prior approval from both the frb and twothirds of its shareholders a bank cannot declare or pay a dividend that would exceed its undivided profits or withdraw any portion of its permanent capital under section of the arizona revised statutes wab may pay dividends on the same basis as any other arizona corporation except that cash dividends paid out of capital surplus require the prior approval of the arizona superintendent under section of the arizona revised statutes a corporation may not make a distribution to stockholders if to do so would render the corporation insolvent or unable to pay its debts as they become due however an arizona bank may not declare a nonstock dividend out of capital surplus without the approval of the arizona superintendent federal reserve system as a member of the federal reserve system wab is required by law to maintain reserves against its transaction deposits the reserves must be held in cash or with the frb banks are permitted to meet this requirement by maintaining the specified amount as an average balance over a twoweek period the total of reserve balances was approximately million and million as of december and respectively source of strength doctrine frb policy requires bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks section of the doddfrank act codified the requirement that bank holding companies act as a source of financial strength as a result the company is expected to commit resources to support wab including at times when the company may not be in a financial position to provide such resources any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks the us bankruptcy code provides that in the event of a bank holding companys bankruptcy any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal banking agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment capital adequacy and prompt corrective action the capital rules established a comprehensive capital framework for us banking organizations the capital rules generally implement the basel committees basel iii final capital framework for strengthening international capital standards the capital rules revise the definitions and the components of regulatory capital as well as address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions regulatory capital ratios the capital rules also address asset risk weights and other matters affecting the denominator in banking institutions regulatory capital ratios and replaced the existing general riskweighting approach with a more risksensitive approach the capital rules i include cet1 and the related regulatory capital ratio of cet1 to riskweighted assets ii specify that tier capital consists of cet1 and additional tier capital instruments meeting certain revised requirements iii mandate that most deductionsadjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to cet1 and not to the other components of capital and iv expand the scope of the deductions from and adjustments to capital as compared to existing regulations under the capital rules for most banking organizations the most common form of additional tier capital is noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and the most common forms of tier capital are subordinated notes and a portion of the allocation for loan and lease losses in each case subject to the capital rules specific requirements pursuant to the capital rules the minimum capital ratios are as follows table start cet1 to riskweighted assets table endtable start tier capital that is cet1 plus additional tier capital to riskweighted assets table endtable start total capital that is tier capital plus tier capital to riskweighted assets and table endtable start tier capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements called leverage ratio table end the capital rules also include a capital conservation buffer composed entirely of cet1 in addition to these minimum riskweighted asset ratios the capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress banking institutions with a ratio of cet1 to riskweighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends equity and other capital instrument repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall the capital rules became fully phasedin on january thus the capital standards applicable to the company include an additional capital conservation buffer of of cet1 effectively resulting in minimum ratios inclusive of the capital conservation buffer of i cet1 to riskweighted assets of at least ii tier capital to riskweighted assets of at least and iii total capital to riskweighted assets of at least the capital rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to cet1 these include for example the requirement that mortgage servicing assets deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks and significant investments in nonconsolidated financial entities be deducted from cet1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds of cet1 or all such items in the aggregate exceed of cet1 the capital rules further prescribe that the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss items reported as a component of stockholders equity be included in cet1 capital however nonadvanced approaches banking organizations may make a onetime permanent election to exclude these items the company as a nonadvanced approaches institution has made this onetime election the capital rules also preclude certain hybrid securities such as trust preferred securities issued on or after may from inclusion in bank holding companies tier capital the company has used trust preferred securities in the past as a tool for raising additional tier capital and otherwise improving its regulatory capital ratios although the company may continue to include its existing trust preferred securities as tier capital the prohibition on the use of these securities as tier capital going forward may limit the companys ability to raise capital in the future the riskweighting categories in the capital rules are standardized and include a risksensitive number of categories depending on the nature of the assets generally ranging from for us government and agency securities to for certain equity exposures and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset classes in september the federal banking agencies proposed simplifying the capital rules on july the federal banking agencies adopted a final rule replacing a substantially similar interim rule to simplify several requirements of the regulatory capital rules for nonadvanced approaches institutions such as the company the final rule simplifies the capital treatment for mortgage servicing assets certain deferred tax assets investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions and minority interest the final rule will be effective as of april for the amendments to simplify the capital rules management believes the company is in compliance and will continue to be in compliance with the targeted capital ratios prompt corrective action and safety and soundness pursuant to section of the fdia federal banking agencies are required to take prompt corrective action should a depository institution fail to meet certain capital adequacy standards at each successive lower capital category an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions including restrictions on growth restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits restrictions or prohibitions on payment of dividends and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits furthermore if an insured depository institution is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the appropriate federal banking agency and the holding company must guarantee the performance of that plan based upon its capital levels a bank that is classified as wellcapitalized adequately capitalized or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency after notice and opportunity for hearing determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment for purposes of prompt corrective action to be i wellcapitalized a bank must have a total risk based capital ratio of at least a tier risk based capital ratio of at least a cet1 risk based capital ratio of at least and a tier leverage ratio of at least ii adequately capitalized a bank must have a total risk based capital ratio of at least a tier risk based capital ratio of at least a cet1 risk based capital ratio of at least and a tier leverage ratio of at least iii undercapitalized a bank would have a total risk based capital ratio of less than a tier risk based capital ratio of less than a cet1 risk based capital ratio of less than and a tier leverage ratio of less than iv significantly undercapitalized a bank would have a total risk based capital ratio of less than a tier risk based capital ratio of less than a cet1 risk based capital ratio of less than and a tier leverage ratio of less than v critically undercapitalized a bank would have a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is less than or equal to bank holding companies and insured banks also may be subject to potential enforcement actions of varying levels of severity by the federal banking agencies for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their business or for violation of any law rule regulation condition imposed in writing by the agency or term of a written agreement with the agency in more serious cases enforcement actions may include i the issuance of directives to increase capital ii the issuance of formal and informal agreements iii the imposition of civil monetary penalties iv the issuance of a cease and desist order that can be judicially enforced v the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against officers directors and other institutionaffiliated parties vi the termination of the banks deposit insurance vii the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the bank and viii the enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders based upon a judicial determination that the agency would be harmed if such equitable relief was not granted transactions with affiliates and insiders under federal law transactions between insured depository institutions and their affiliates are governed by sections and of the fra and implementing regulation w in a bank holding company context at a minimum the parent holding company of a bank and any companies which are controlled by such parent holding company are affiliates of the bank generally sections and of the fra are intended to protect insured depository institutions from losses arising from transactions with noninsured affiliates by limiting the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate and with all affiliates of the bank in the aggregate and requiring that such transactions be on terms consistent with safe and sound banking practices further section 22h of the fra and its implementing regulation o restricts loans to directors executive officers and principal stockholders insiders under section 22h loans to insiders and their related interests may not exceed together with all other outstanding loans to such persons and affiliated entities the institutions total capital and surplus loans to insiders above specified amounts must receive the prior approval of the bod further under section 22h of the fra loans to directors executive officers and principal stockholders must be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons except that such insiders may receive preferential loans made under a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to the banks employees and does not give preference to the insider over the employees section 22g of the fra places additional limitations on loans to executive officers lending limits in addition to the requirements set forth above state banking law generally limits the amount of funds that a statechartered bank may lend to a single borrower under section of the arizona revised statutes the obligations of one borrower to a bank may not exceed of the banks capital plus an additional of its capital if the additional amounts are fully secured by readily marketable collateral brokered deposits section of the fdia and fdic regulations generally limit the ability of any bank to accept renew or roll over any brokered deposit unless it is well capitalized or with the fdics approval adequately capitalized however as a result of the egrrcpa the fdic has undertaken a comprehensive review of its regulatory approach to brokered deposits including reciprocal deposits and interest rate caps applicable to banks that are less than well capitalized on december the fdic issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to modernize its brokered deposit regulations at this time it is difficult to predict what changes if any to the

they have made to such insured depository institution federal deposit insurance substantially all of the deposits of wab are insured up to applicable limits by the fdics dif the basic limit on fdic deposit insurance is per depositor wab is subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the dif the fdic uses a riskbased assessment system that imposes insurance premiums based upon a risk matrix that takes into account a banks camels rating the risk matrix utilizes different risk categories distinguished by capital levels and supervisory ratings as a result of the doddfrank act the base for insurance assessments is now consolidated average assets less average tangible equity assessment rates are calculated using formulas that take into account the risk of the institution being assessed wab is classified as and subject to the scorecard for a large and highly complex institution to determine its total base assessment rate the doddfrank act requires that the fdic raise the minimum reserve ratio of the dif from to and that the fdic offset the effect of this increase on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of less than billion in march the fdic finalized a rule to impose a surcharge of  per of their assessment base on deposit insurance assessment rates paid by insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of more than billion as of june the minimum reserve ratio reached and as such wab was subject to the surcharge beginning july at september the reserve ratio reached exceeding the statutorily required minimum as a

privacy and data security the company is subject to federal laws including the glba and certain state laws containing consumer privacy protection provisions these provisions limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to affiliated and nonaffiliated third parties and limit the reuse of certain consumer information received from nonaffiliated institutions these provisions require notice of privacy policies to consumers and in some circumstances allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to affiliates or nonaffiliated third parties by means of opt out or opt in authorizations for example in august the cfpb published its final rule to update regulation p pursuant to the amended glba under this rule certain qualifying financial institutions are not required to provide annual privacy notices to customers to qualify a financial institution must not share nonpublic personal information about customers except as described in certain statutory exceptions that do not trigger a customers statutory optout right in addition the financial institution must not have changed its disclosure policies and practices from those disclosed in its most recent privacy notice the rule sets forth timing requirements for delivery of annual privacy notices in the event that a financial institution that qualified for the annual notice exemption later changes its policies or practices in such a way that it no longer qualifies for the exemption the glba also requires that financial institutions implement comprehensive written information security programs that include administrative technical and physical safeguards to protect consumer information further pursuant to interpretive guidance issued under the glba and certain state laws financial institutions are required to notify customers of security breaches that result in unauthorized access to their nonpublic personal information for example under california law every business that owns or licenses personal information about a california resident must maintain reasonable security procedures and policies to protect that information and comply with specific requirements relating to the destruction of records containing personal information and disclosure of breaches to customers and restrictions on the use of customer information unless the customer opts in other states including arizona and nevada where wab has branches may also have applicable laws requiring businesses that retain consumer personal information to develop reasonable security policies and procedures notify consumers of a security breach or provide disclosures about the use and sharing of consumer personal information the federal banking agencies including the frb through the federal financial institutions examination council have adopted guidelines to encourage financial institutions to address cybersecurity risks and identify assess and mitigate these risks both internally and at critical thirdparty services providers in october the federal bank regulatory agencies issued proposed rules on enhanced cybersecurity risk management and resilience standards that would apply to very large financial institutions and to services provided by third parties to these institutions the comment period for these proposed rules has closed and a final rule has not been published although the proposed rules would apply only to bank holding companies and banks with billion or more in total consolidated assets these rules could influence the federal bank regulatory agencies expectations and supervisory requirements for information security standards and cybersecurity programs of financial institutions with less than billion in total consolidated assets these laws and regulations impose compliance costs and create obligations and in some cases reporting obligations and compliance with these laws regulations and obligations require significant resources of wal and wab community reinvestment act and fair lending laws wab has a responsibility under the cra to help meet the credit needs of its communities including low and moderate income neighborhoods the cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institutions discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community consistent with the cra in addition the equal credit opportunity act and the fair housing act prohibit discrimination in lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes wabs failure to comply with the provisions of the cra could at a minimum result in regulatory restrictions on its activities and the activities of the company wabs failure to comply with the equal credit opportunity act and the fair housing act could result in enforcement actions wab received a rating of satisfactory in its most recent cra examination in january on december the occ and the fdic issued a joint notice of proposed rulemaking to modernize the regulations implementing the cra while the proposed rule will not apply to wab because its primary federal regulator is the frb it may impact the overall environment as it relates to cra compliance and portend future changes by the frb under the rulemaking the federal banking agencies intend to i clarify which activities qualify for cra credit ii update where activities count for cra credit iii create a more transparent and objective method for measuring cra performance and iv provide for more transparent consistent and timely crarelated data collection record keeping and reporting wal and wab expect to monitor developments with respect to this rulemaking and assess the impact if any of changes to the cra regulations proposed by the federal banking agencies federal home loan bank of san francisco wab is a member of the fhlb of san francisco which is one of regional fhlbs that provide funding to their members to support residential lending as well as affordable housing and community development loans each fhlb serves as a reserve or central bank for the members within its assigned region each fhlb makes loans to its members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the board of directors of the fhlb as a member wab must purchase and maintain stock in the fhlb of san francisco at december wabs total investment in fhlb stock was million incentive compensation the doddfrank act requires the federal banking agencies and the sec to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentivebased payment arrangements at specified regulated entities including the company and wab with at least billion in total consolidated assets that encourage inappropriate risks by providing an executive officer employee director or principal shareholder with excessive compensation fees or benefits that could lead to material financial loss to the entity the federal banking agencies and the sec most recently proposed such regulations in but the regulations have not yet been finalized if the regulations are adopted in the form initially proposed they will restrict the manner in which executive compensation is structured the doddfrank act also requires publicly traded companies to give stockholders a nonbinding vote on executive compensation at least every three years and on socalled golden parachute payments in connection with approvals of mergers and acquisitions wal gives stockholders a
