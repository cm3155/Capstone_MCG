item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and equity prices the companys market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending investing and deposit taking activities to that end management actively monitors and manages the companys interest rate risk exposure the company generally manages its interest rate sensitivity by evaluating repricing opportunities on its earning assets to those on its funding liabilities management uses various assetliability strategies to manage the repricing characteristics of the companys assets and liabilities all of which are designed to ensure that exposure to interest rate fluctuations is limited to within the companys guidelines of acceptable levels of risktaking hedging strategies including the terms and pricing of loans and deposits and management of the deployment of its securities are used to reduce mismatches in interest rate repricing opportunities of portfolio assets and their funding sources derivatives in a hedging relationship are also used to minimize the companys exposure to changes in benchmark interest rates and volatility of net interest income and eve to interest rate fluctuations with their impact reflected in the model results discussed below interest rate risk is addressed by alco which includes members of executive management finance and operations alco monitors interest rate risk by analyzing the potential impact on the net eve and net interest income from potential changes in interest rates and considers the impact of alternative strategies or changes in balance sheet structure the company manages its balance sheet in part to keep the potential impact on eve and net interest income within acceptable ranges despite changes in interest rates the companys exposure to interest rate risk is reviewed at least quarterly by alco interest rate risk exposure is measured using interest rate sensitivity analysis to determine its change in both eve and net interest income in the event of hypothetical changes in interest rates if potential changes to eve and net interest income resulting from hypothetical interest rate changes are not within the limits established by the bod or alco determines that interest rate exposures should be reduced alco will either take hedging actions or adjust the asset and liability mix to bring interest rate risk within bodapproved limits or in line with alcos proposed reduction alco may also decide the best course of action for a limit breach is to accept the breach and present justification to the bod if the bod does not agree to accept the limit breach it will direct alco to remediate the breach the companys net interest income and eve exposure limits are approved by the bod on an annual basis or more often if market conditions warrant during the year ended december there have been no changes to the companys exposure limits net interest income simulation to measure interest rate risk at december the company used a simulation model to project changes in net interest income that result from forecasted changes in interest rates this analysis calculates the difference between a baseline net interest income forecast using current yield curves compared to forecasted net income resulting from an immediate parallel shift in rates upward or downward along with other scenarios directed by alco the income simulation model includes various assumptions regarding repricing relationships for each of the companys products many of the companys assets are variable rate loans which are assumed to reprice at the next rate reset period and proportional to the change in market rates depending on their contracted index including the impact of caps or floors some loans and investments contain contractual prepayment features embedded options and accordingly the simulation model incorporates prepayment assumptions the companys nonterm deposit products reprice with a certain beta to underlying market rate changes the company regularly conducts sensitivity analysis for this assumption to determine the impact on the interest rate risk position these betas are derived separately by deposit product and are based on both observed and projected market rate and balance trends current deposit beta assumptions range between to depending on product with an average interest bearing deposit beta of this analysis indicates the impact of changes in net interest income for the given set of rate changes and assumptions it assumes loan and deposit balances remain static and do not change over the course of the year it does not account for all factors that could impact the companys results including changes by management to mitigate interest rate changes or secondary factors such as changes to the companys credit risk profile as interest rates change the results also will be impacted by seasonality in the balance sheet furthermore loan prepayment rate estimates and spread relationships change regularly interest rate changes create changes in actual loan prepayment speeds that will differ from the market estimates incorporated in this analysis these assumptions are inherently uncertain and as a result actual results may differ from simulated results due to factors such as timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions customer behavior and management strategies and changes that vary significantly from the modeled assumptions may have a significant effect on the companys actual net interest income this simulation model assesses the changes in net interest income that would occur in response to an instantaneous and sustained increase or decrease shock in market interest rates a down scenario in this simulation model is also being presented as of december as current projections of future market rates include consideration of rate decreases in the current high rate environment the company will continue to evaluate the scenarios that are presented as interest rates change and will update these scenario disclosures as appropriate sensitivity of net interest income table start down down up up change in basis points from base parallel shift scenario interest rate ramp scenario table end at december our net interest income exposure for the next twelve months related to these hypothetical changes in market interest rates was within our current guidelines economic value of equity the company measures the impact of market interest rate changes on the npv of estimated cash flows from its assets liabilities and offbalance sheet items defined as eve using a simulation model the companys simulation model focuses on parallel interest rate shocks and takes into account assumptions related to loan prepayment trends that are sourced using a combination of thirdparty prepayment models and internal historical experience terminal maturity for nonmaturity deposits decay attrition and pricing sensitivity derived from the companys data and other internallydeveloped analysis and models these assumptions are reviewed at least annually and are adjusted periodically to reflect changes in market conditions and the companys balance sheet composition as simulated model results are based on a number of assumptions outlined above including forecasted market conditions actual amounts may differ significantly from the projections set forth below should market conditions vary from the underlying assumptions the companys eve model assumptions have not changed from the assumptions used in its december simulation this simulation model assesses the changes in the market value of interest rate sensitive financial instruments that would occur in response to an instantaneous and sustained increase or decrease shock in market interest rates the company will continue to evaluate the scenarios that are presented as interest rates change and will update these scenario disclosures as appropriate the following table
