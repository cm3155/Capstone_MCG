item risk factors investing in our common stock involves various risks many of which are specific to our business the discussion below addresses the material risks and uncertainties of which we are currently aware that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition other risks that we do not know about now or that we do not currently believe are material could negatively impact our business or the trading price of our securities see additional discussions about credit interest rate market and litigation risks in item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations market and economic risks the covid19 pandemic and resulting adverse economic conditions have adversely impacted our business and results and could have a more material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations the ongoing covid19 global and national health emergency has caused significant disruption in the united states and international economies and financial markets although we have continued operating the covid19 pandemic has caused disruptions to our business and could cause material disruptions to our business and operations in the future impacts to our business have included the transition of a portion of our workforce to home locations increases in costs due to additional health and safety precautions implemented at branches and an increase in draws on unfunded loan commitments and requests for forbearance and loan modifications at the onset of the pandemic to the extent that commercial and social restrictions remain in place or increase our expenses delinquencies foreclosures and credit losses may materially increase in addition the unprecedented nature of covid19 related disruptions heighten the inherent uncertainty of forecasting future economic conditions and their impact on our loan portfolio and therefore increases the risk that the assumptions judgments and estimates used to determine the appropriate allowance for future credit losses may prove to be incorrect resulting in actual credit losses that exceed our recorded allowance we are continuing to monitor the covid19 pandemic including the emergence and impact of the delta and omicron variants its economic effects and related risks although the rapid development and fluidity of the situation precludes any specific prediction as to its ultimate impact among the factors outside our control that are likely to affect the impact the covid19 pandemic will ultimately have on our business are the pandemics course and severity including the impact related to the distribution and effectiveness of the available covid19 vaccines and treatments and the potential development for additional vaccines and treatments in the future the direct and indirect results of the pandemic such as recessionary economic trends including with respect to employment wages and benefits commercial activity consumer spending and real estate market values political legal and regulatory actions and policies in response to the pandemic including the effects of restrictions on commerce and banking such as moratoria and other suspensions of collections foreclosures and related obligations the timing magnitude and effect of public spending directly or through subsidies its direct and indirect effects on commercial activity and incentives of employers and individuals to resume or increase employment wages and benefits and commercial activity the timing and availability of direct and indirect governmental support for various financial assets including mortgage loans the potential longterm impact on the tourism and hospitality industries which could affect our hotel franchise finance business and portfolio potential longerterm effects of increased government spending on the interest rate environment borrowing costs for nongovernmental parties and inflation the ability of our employees and thirdparty vendors to work effectively during the course of the pandemic potential longerterm shifts toward mobile banking telecommuting and telecommerce and geographic variation in the severity and duration of the covid19 pandemic including in states in which we operate physically such as arizona california and nevada if the covid19 pandemic results in a continuation or worsening of current economic conditions and commercial environments our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected additional potential effects related to the covid19 pandemic are discussed in the other risk factors contained in this report our financial performance may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally our financial performance is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where we operate and in the us as a whole unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth business activity or investor or business confidence limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital increases in inflation or interest rates government shutdowns the imposition of tariffs on trade natural disasters the emergence of widespread health emergencies or pandemics terrorist attacks acts of war including the impact of the escalating military conflict between russia and ukraine or a combination of these or other factors the ongoing covid19 pandemic has caused significant disruption in the us economy and financial markets including in arizona where we are headquartered and california and nevada where we have significant operations the specific impact on us of unfavorable or uncertain economic or market conditions is difficult to predict could be long or short term and may be indirect such as disruptions in our customers supply chain or a reduction in the demand for their products or services a worsening of business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the principal markets in which we conduct business could have adverse effects including the following a decrease in deposit balances or the demand for loans and other products and services we offer an increase in the number of borrowers who become delinquent file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to us which could lead to higher levels of nonperforming assets net chargeoffs and provisions for credit losses a decrease in the value of loans and other assets or in the value of collateral a decrease in net interest income from our lending and deposit gathering activities an impairment of certain intangible assets such as goodwill and an increase in competition resulting from increasing consolidation within the financial services industry in the us financial services industry the commercial soundness of financial institutions is closely interrelated as a result of credit trading clearing or other relationships between the institutions as a result concerns about or a default or threatened default by one institution could lead to significant marketwide liquidity and credit problems losses or defaults by other institutions this is sometimes referred to as systemic risk and may adversely affect financial intermediaries such as clearing agencies clearing houses banks securities firms and exchanges with which we interact on a daily basis and therefore could adversely affect us it is possible that the business environment in the us will continue to be challenging or experience additional volatility in the future there can be no assurance that such conditions will improve in the near term or that conditions will not worsen such conditions could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition changes in interest rates and increased rate competition could adversely affect our profitability business and prospects most of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature which subjects us to significant risks from changes in interest rates and can impact our net income the valuation of our assets and liabilities and our ability to effectively manage our interest rate risk we derive a significant amount of our revenue from net interest income and therefore our net income depends heavily on our net interest margin net interest margin is the difference between the interest we receive on loans securities and other earning assets and the interest we pay on interestbearing deposits borrowings and other liabilities these rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control including competition general economic conditions and monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities including the frb in a rising rate environment the rate of interest we pay on our interestbearing deposits borrowings and other liabilities may increase more quickly than the rate of interest we receive on loans securities and other earning assets which could adversely impact our net interest income and earnings conversely our earnings also could be adversely affected in a declining rate environment if the rates on our loans and other investments fall more quickly than those on our deposits and other liabilities because of our relatively high reliance on net interest income our revenue and earnings are more sensitive to changes in market rates than other financial institutions that have more diversified sources of revenue loan volumes are also affected by market interest rates on loans lower interest rates are usually associated with higher loan originations conversely decreasing interest rates generally increase loan repayment rates and cause more borrowers to refinance loans which could result in the loss of future net servicing revenues with an associated writedown of the related msrs in contrast in rising interest rate environments loan repayment rates generally decline and result in a lower volume of loan originations in addition to the impact on our lending business a decrease in loan originations would adversely affect the volume of loans available for purchase by our mortgage warehouse lending platform in addition to the potential effects on net interest margin and loan volumes an increase in the general level of interest rates may adversely affect the ability of certain borrowers to pay interest and principal on their obligations and may also reduce the amount of noninterest income we can earn due to potentially lower levels of banking business conducted generally as well lower levels of servicing gain on sale and other revenues generated through our residential mortgage business interest rates are expected to rise in the federal reserves target range for the federal funds rate has remained at to percent since the onset of the pandemic in the january fomc meeting the federal funds target rate was kept at the current range although the fomc signaled that it expects to raise the target range for the federal funds rate in the near term with this guidance many market commentators have published revised forecasts and are anticipating multiple rate hikes in an increase in interest rates could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows our financial instruments expose us to certain market risks and may increase the volatility of earnings and aoci we hold certain financial instruments measured at fair value for those financial instruments measured at fair value we are required to recognize the changes in the fair value of such instruments in earnings or aoci each quarter therefore any increases or decreases in the fair value of these financial instruments have a corresponding impact on reported earnings or aoci fair value can be affected by a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control including our credit position interest rate volatility capital markets volatility and other economic factors accordingly we are subject to marktomarket risk and the application of fair value accounting may cause our earnings and aoci to be more volatile than would be suggested by our underlying performance due to the inherent risk associated with accounting estimates our allowance for credit losses may be insufficient which could require us to raise additional capital or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations credit losses are inherent in the business of making loans management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our consolidated loan portfolio and maintains an acl the measurement of expected credit losses takes place at the time the financial asset is first added to the balance sheet with periodic updates thereafter and is based on a number of factors including the size of the portfolio asset classifications economic trends industry experience and trends industry and geographic concentrations estimated collateral values managements assessment of the credit risk inherent in the portfolio loan underwriting policies historical loan loss experience and reasonable and supportable forecasts in addition we individually evaluate all loans identified as problem loans and establish an allowance based upon our estimation of the potential loss associated with those problem loans additions to the acl recorded through our provision for credit losses decrease our net income measurement of expected credit losses under cecl has generally resulted in more volatility in the provision for credit losses and the resulting acl in comparison to the incurred loss model if managements assumptions and judgments are incorrect or if economic conditions worsen compared to forecast our actual credit losses may exceed our acl at december our acl on funded loans and loss contingency on unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit totals million and million respectively deterioration in the real estate market or general economic conditions could affect the ability of our loan customers to service their debt which could result in additional loan loss provisions and increases in our acl in addition we may be required to record additional loan provisions or increase our acl based on new information regarding existing loans input from regulators in connection with their review of our loan portfolio changes in regulatory guidance regulations or accounting standards identification of additional problem loans changes in economic outlook and other factors both within and outside of our managements control moreover because future events are uncertain and because we may not successfully identify all deteriorating loans in a timely manner there may be loans that deteriorate in an accelerated time frame any increases in the provision or acl will result in a decrease in our net income and potentially capital and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations if actual credit losses materially exceed our acl we may be required to raise additional capital which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all our inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and capital the markets in which we operate are subject to the risk of both natural and manmade disasters many of the real and personal properties securing our loans are located in california and more generally in the southwestern portion of the united state much of california experiences wildfires from time to time that cause significant damage throughout the state while these wildfires have not significantly damaged our own properties it is possible that our borrowers may experience losses in the future which may materially impair their ability to meet the terms of their obligations california is also prone to other natural disasters including but not limited to drought earthquakes flooding and mudslides additional significant natural or manmade disasters in the state of california or in our other markets could lead to damage or injury to our own properties andor employees and could increase the risk that many of our borrowers may experience losses or sustained job interruption which may materially impair their ability to maintain deposits or meet the terms of their loan obligations therefore additional natural disasters a manmade disaster or a catastrophic event or a combination of these or other factors in any of our markets could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows climate change or societal responses to climate change could adversely affect our business and performance including indirectly through impacts on our customers and vendors the lack of empirical data surrounding the credit and other financial risks posed by climate change makes it impossible to predict the specific impact climate change may have on our financial condition and results of operations however the physical effects of climate change may also impact us in addition to the risk of more frequent andor severe natural disasters climate change can result in longer term shifts in climate patterns such as extreme heat sea level rise declining fresh water resources and more frequent and prolonged drought the effects of climate change and may have a significant effect in our geographic markets and could disrupt our operations the operations of our customers or third parties on which we rely or supply chains generally these disruptions including increased regulation and compliance cost for our customers and changes in consumer behaviors could result in declines in the economic conditions in geographic markets or industries in which our customers operate and impact their ability to repay loans or maintain deposits and could affect the value of real estate and other assets that serve as collateral for loans bank regulators have increasingly viewed financial institutions as playing an important role in helping to address climate change which may result in increased requirements regarding the disclosure and management of climate risks and related lending activities we may also become subject to new or heightened regulatory requirements related to climate change such as requirements relating to operational resiliency or stress testing for various climate stress scenarios new or increased regulations could result in increased compliance costs or capital requirements changes in regulations and customer preferences and behaviors could negatively affect our growth or force us to alter our business strategies including whether and on what terms and conditions we will engage in certain activities or offer certain products or services and which growth industries and customers we pursue additionally our reputation and customer relationships may be damaged due to our practices related to climate change including our involvement or our customers involvement in certain industries or projects associated with causing or exacerbating climate change as well as any decisions we make to continue to conduct or change our activities in response to considerations relating to climate change overall climate change its effects and the resulting unknown impact could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations credit risks we are highly dependent on real estate and events that negatively impact the real estate market will hurt our business and earnings a significant portion of our business is located in areas in which economic growth is largely dependent on the real estate market and a majority of our loan portfolio is secured by or otherwise dependent on real estate the market for real estate is cyclical and a significant change in the real estate market that resulted in deterioration in the value of collateral or rental or occupancy rates could adversely affect borrowers ability to repay loans changes in the real estate market could also affect the value of foreclosed assets a decline in real estate activity would likely cause a decline in asset and deposit growth and negatively impact our earnings and financial condition our loan portfolio contains concentrations in certain business lines or product types that have unique risk characteristics and may expose us to increased lending risks our loan portfolio consists primarily of commercial and industrial residential mortgage and cre loans which contain material concentrations in certain business lines or product types such as mortgage warehouse real estate corporate finance municipal and nonprofit loans as well as in specific business sectors such as technology and innovation these loan concentrations present unique risks and involve specialized underwriting and management as they often involve large loan balances to a single borrower or group of related borrowers consequently an adverse development with respect to one commercial loan or one credit relationship may adversely affect us in addition based on the nature of lending to these specialty markets repayment of loans may be dependent upon borrowers receiving additional equity financing or in some cases a successful sale to a third party public offering or other form of liquidity event our commercial and industrial cre and construction loans are also largely concentrated in selected markets in arizona california and nevada as a result of this geographic concentration deterioration in economic conditions in these markets could result in an increase in loan delinquencies and chargeoffs an increase in problem assets and foreclosures a decrease in the demand for our products and services or a decrease in the value of real estate and other collateral for loans like the rest of the united states economic conditions in these states have been adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic and there can be no assurance as to if or when such conditions will improve or that such conditions will not worsen unforeseen adverse events changes in economic conditions and changes in regulatory policy affecting borrowers industries or markets could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations our credit linked notes do not ensure full protection against credit losses and as such we could still incur significant credit losses on loans for which risk of loss has been transferred pursuant to these transactions we have entered into two transactions to mitigate exposure to losses on our loan portfolio these transactions are structured as senior unsecured credit linked notes which transfer the risk of first losses on covered loans to these note holders these notes have an aggregate principal amount of million and million on a billion and billion reference pool of warehouse loans and residential mortgages respectively pursuant to these arrangements in the event of borrower default the principal balance of the notes will be reduced by the amount of the loss up to the amount of the aggregate principal of the notes however all residual risk over and above the first loss position is retained by us while current estimates of future credit losses are below the first loss position no assurances can be given that these losses will not exceed the first loss position and if credit losses were to exceed the first loss position our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely effected we may enter into more such transactions in the future we are exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to properties to which we obtain title approximately of our loan portfolio at december was secured by real estate in the course of our business we may foreclose on and take title to real estate and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties we may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage personal injury investigation and cleanup costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at a property the costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial in addition if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property these costs and claims could be substantial and adversely affect our business and prospects strategic risks our future success depends on our ability to compete effectively in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving market we face substantial competition in all phases of our operations from a variety of different competitors our competitors including money center banks national and regional commercial banks community banks thrift institutions mutual savings banks credit unions finance companies insurance companies securities dealers brokers mortgage bankers investment advisors money market mutual funds financial technology companies and other financial institutions compete with lending and depositgathering services offered by us increased competition in our markets or our inability to compete effectively may result in reduced loans and deposits or less favorable pricing in particular we have experienced intense price and terms competition in some of the lending lines of business and deposits in recent years many of these competing institutions have much greater financial and marketing resources than we have due to their size larger competitors can achieve economies of scale and may offer a broader range of products and services or more attractive pricing than us in addition some of the financial services organizations with which we compete are not subject to the same degree of regulation as is imposed on bank holding companies and federally insured depository institutions as a result these nonbank competitors have certain advantages over us in accessing funding and in providing various services the banking business in our primary market areas is very competitive and the level of competition facing us may increase further which may limit our asset growth and financial results in particular our predominate source of revenue is net interest income therefore if we are unable to compete effectively including sustaining loan and deposit growth at our historical levels our business and results of operations may be adversely affected the financial services industry also is facing increasing competitive pressure from the introduction of disruptive new technologies such as blockchain and digital payments often by nontraditional competitors and financial technology companies among other things technology and other changes are allowing customers to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks at one or both ends of the transaction the elimination of banks as intermediaries for certain transactions as well as further disruption of traditional bank businesses and products by nonbanks could result in the loss of fee income and deposits and otherwise adversely affect our business and results our expansion strategy may not prove to be successful and our market value and profitability may suffer we continually evaluate expansion through acquisitions of banks and other financial assets and businesses like previous acquisitions by us such as the acquisition of amerihome in and digital settlement technologies llc in early any future acquisitions will be accompanied by risks commonly encountered in such transactions including among other things time and expense incurred while identifying evaluating and negotiating potential acquisitions and transactions difficulty in accurately estimating the value of target companies or assets and in evaluating target companies or assets credit operations management and market risks potential payment of a premium over book and market values that may cause dilution of our tangible book value or earnings per share exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company potential exposure to asset quality issues of the target company difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel potential disruption of our ongoing business failure to retain key personnel at the acquired business inability of our management to maximize our financial and strategic position by the successful implementation of uniform product offerings and the incorporation of uniform technology into our product offerings and control systems and failure to realize any expected revenue increases cost savings and other projected benefits from an acquisition we expect that competition for suitable acquisition candidates may be significant we may compete with other banks or financial service companies with similar acquisition strategies many of which are larger and have greater financial and other resources we cannot assure that we will be able to successfully identify and acquire suitable acquisition targets on acceptable terms and conditions or that we will be able to obtain the regulatory approvals needed to complete any such transactions we cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions potential regulatory enforcement actions could also adversely affect our ability to engage in certain acquisition activities our inability to overcome the risks inherent in the successful completion and integration of acquisitions could have an adverse effect on the achievement of our business strategy there are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with the introduction or expansion of lines of business or new products and services within existing lines of business from time to time we may implement new lines of business offer new products and services within existing lines of business or offer existing products or services to new industries geographies or market segments there are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed or industries are heavily regulated in developing and marketing new lines of business andor new products and services we may invest significant time and resources initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business andor new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove attainable external factors such as compliance with laws and regulations competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences or government policies may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business product or service or the offering of existing products and services to an emerging industry furthermore any new line of business andor new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we are pursuing digital payments initiatives which are subject to significant uncertainty and could adversely affect our business reputation or financial results we are pursuing digital payments initiatives including our recently announced acquisition of digital settlement technologies llc a digital payments platform for the class action legal industry and our recently announced decision to implement a fully integrated digital banking platform for our customers including a digital token powered by the tassatpay platform the digital payments products and services we offer may use or rely on blockchainbased technologies or assets use of blockchainbased technologies in payments are a relatively new and unproven technology and the laws and regulations surrounding them are uncertain and evolving blockchain and digital payment technology has drawn significant scrutiny from governments and regulators in multiple jurisdictions and we expect that scrutiny to continue any changes in such laws and regulations applicable to or scrutiny directed at our products and services may impede or delay the offering of digital payments solutions increase our operating costs require significant management time and attention or otherwise harm our business or results of operations in addition market acceptance of digital payments products and services is subject to significant uncertainty as such there can be no assurance that digital payments products and services we offer and the technologies we have chosen to implement will be accepted and desired by customers we do not have significant prior experience with blockchainbased technology which may adversely affect our ability to successfully integrate and market such digital payments products and services we also will incur increased costs in connection with these efforts and our investments may not be successful any of these events could adversely affect our business reputation or financial results our success is dependent upon our ability to recruit and retain qualified employees including members of our divisional and business line leadership and management teams our business plan includes and is dependent upon hiring and retaining highly qualified and motivated executives and employees at every level in particular our relative success to date has been partly the result of our managements ability to identify and retain highly qualified employees in divisional business line and geographic leadership and administrative support roles and experienced bankers with expertise in certain specialty areas or that have longstanding relationships in their communities or markets including with respect to our businesstobusiness mortgage platform these professionals bring with them valuable knowledge specialized skills and expertise customer relationships and in some cases extensive ties within markets upon which our competitive strategy is based and have been an integral part of our ability to attract deposits and to expand our market share we have not entered into employment agreements with most of our employees and competition for talent in our industry is intense the labor market is currently challenging with employee turnover at an alltime high and increased wage pressure in addition the transition to an increased remote work environment which we believe is likely to survive the covid19 pandemic for many organizations may exacerbate the challenges of attracting and retaining talented and diverse employees as job markets may be less constrained by physical geography we incentivize employee retention through our equity incentive plans however we cannot guarantee the effectiveness of our equity incentive plans in retaining these key employees and executives were we to lose key employees we may not be able to replace them with equally qualified persons who bring the same skills and knowledge of and ties to the communities and markets within which we operate if we are unable to retain qualified employees or hire new qualified employees to keep up with or outpace employee turnover we may not be able to successfully execute our business strategy or may incur additional costs to achieve our objectives further as it relates to the pandemic we have taken and are continuing to take actions to protect the safety and wellbeing of our employees and customers however no assurance can be given that the steps being taken will be adequate or appropriate the continued or renewed spread of covid19 or a similar pandemic could negatively impact the availability of key personnel necessary to conduct our business most of our workforce has returned to working in our office buildings and it is possible that one or more members of senior management or other key employees contracts the virus and is unable to perform their essential duties we could be harmed if our succession planning is inadequate to mitigate the loss of key members of our senior management team we believe that our senior management team has contributed greatly to our performance in addition we from time to time experience retirements and other changes to our senior management team our future performance depends on a smooth transition of our senior management including finding and training highly qualified replacements who are properly equipped to lead us we have adopted retention strategies including equity awards from which our senior management team benefits in order to achieve our goals however we cannot assure our succession planning and retention strategies will be effective and the loss of senior management could have an adverse effect on our business liquidity risks if we lose a significant portion of our core deposits or a significant deposit relationship or our cost of funding deposits increases significantly our liquidity andor profitability would be adversely impacted our success depends on our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity to fund our current obligations and support loan growth and specifically to attract and retain a stable base of relatively lowcost deposits the competition for these deposits in our markets is strong and customers may demand higher interest rates on their deposits or seek other investments offering higher rates of return we offer reciprocal deposit products through third party networks to customers seeking federal insurance for deposit amounts that exceed the applicable deposit insurance limit at a single institution we also from time to time offer other credit enhancements to depositors such as fhlb letters of credit and for certain deposits of public monies pledges of collateral in the form of readily marketable securities any event or circumstance that interferes with or limits our ability to offer these products to customers that require greater security for their deposits such as a significant regulatory enforcement action or a significant decline in capital levels at our bank subsidiary could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain deposits if we were to lose a significant deposit relationship or a significant portion of our lowcost deposits we would be required to borrow from other sources at higher rates and our liquidity and profitability would be adversely impacted we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify investors under certain circumstances a substantial portion of our mortgage banking operations involves the sale of loans to third parties including through securitization when loans are sold or securitized we make customary representations and warranties about such loans to the loan purchaser or through documents governing our securitized loan pools if a mortgage loan does not comply with the representations and warranties made with respect to it at the time of its sale we could be required to repurchase the loan replace it with a substitute loan andor indemnify secondary market purchasers or investors for losses and may not have recourse to the correspondent seller that sold the mortgage loans and breached similar or other representations and warranties significant indemnification or repurchase activity on securitized or sold loans without offsetting recourse to a counterparty from which the loan was purchased could have a material adverse effect our financial condition and results of operations we utilize borrowings from the fhlb and the frb and there can be no assurance these programs will be available as needed as of december we have no borrowings from the fhlb of san francisco or the frb however we have utilized borrowings from the fhlb of san francisco and the frb to satisfy our shortterm liquidity needs our borrowing capacity is generally dependent on the value of our collateral pledged to these entities these lenders could reduce our borrowing capacity or eliminate certain types of collateral and could otherwise modify or even terminate their loan programs any change to or termination of these programs could have an adverse effect on our liquidity and profitability a change in our creditworthiness could increase our cost of funding or adversely affect our liquidity market participants regularly evaluate our creditworthiness and the creditworthiness of our longterm debt based on a number of factors some of which are not entirely within our control including our financial strength and conditions within the financial services industry generally there can be no assurance that our perceived creditworthiness will remain the same changes could adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding and our access to the capital markets and could increase our cost of capital likewise any loss of or decline in the credit rating assigned to wab could impair our ability to attract deposits or to obtain other funding sources or increase our cost of funding operational and technological risks a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of our thirdparty vendors and other service providers including as a result of cyberattacks could disrupt our businesses result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information damage our reputation increase our costs and cause losses our operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and other information as a result of the covid19 pandemic the number of our employees working remotely at least some of the time has increased substantially although we take numerous protective measures to maintain the confidentiality integrity and security of our customers information across all geographies and product lines and endeavor to modify these protective measures as circumstances warrant the nature of the threats continues to evolve as a result our computer systems software and networks and those of our customers and thirdparty vendors may be vulnerable to unauthorized payments and account access loss or destruction of data including confidential client information account takeovers unavailability of service computer viruses or other malicious code cyberattacks and other events that could have an adverse security impact and result in significant losses to us andor our customers these threats may originate externally from increasingly sophisticated third parties including foreign governments organized criminal groups and other hackers or from outsourced or infrastructuresupport providers and application developers or the threats may originate from within our organization we also face the risk of operational disruption failure termination or capacity constraints of any of the third parties that facilitate our business activities including vendors exchanges clearing agents clearing houses or other financial intermediaries such parties could also be the source or cause of an attack on or breach of our operational systems data or infrastructure in addition we may be at risk of an operational failure with respect to our customers systems our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of among other things the ongoing covid19 pandemic the evolving nature of these threats the outsourcing of many of our business operations and the continued uncertain global economic environment as cyber threats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities we maintain insurance policies that we believe provide reasonable coverage at a manageable expense for an institution of our size and scope with similar technological systems however we cannot assure that these policies will afford coverage for all possible losses or would be sufficient to cover all financial losses damages or penalties including lost revenues should we experience any one or more of our or a third partys systems failing or experiencing an attack we rely on third parties to provide key components of our business infrastructure we rely on third parties to provide key components for our business operations such as data processing and storage recording and monitoring transactions online banking interfaces and services internet connections and network access while we select these thirdparty vendors carefully we do not control their actions any problems caused by these third parties including those resulting from breakdowns or other disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes cyberattacks and security breaches at a vendor failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason poor performance by a vendor or service issues caused by the effects of covid19 or a similar pandemic on a vendor could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business financial or operational difficulties of a thirdparty vendor could also hurt our operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendors ability to serve us replacing these thirdparty vendors also could create significant delays and expense any of these things could adversely affect our business and financial performance our business may be adversely affected by fraud as a financial institution we are inherently exposed to a wide range of operational risks including but not limited to theft and other fraudulent activity by employees customers and other third parties targeting us andor our customers or data such activity may take many forms including check fraud electronic fraud wire fraud phishing social engineering and other dishonest acts although we devote substantial resources to maintaining effective policies and internal controls to identify and prevent such incidents given the persistence and increasing sophistication of possible perpetrators we may experience financial losses or reputational harm as a result of fraud our controls and processes our reporting systems and procedures and our operational infrastructure may not be able to keep pace with our growth which could cause us to experience compliance and operational problems or lose customers or incur additional expenditures beyond current projections any one of which could adversely affect our financial results our future success will depend on the ability of officers and other key employees to effectively implement solutions designed to improve operational credit financial management and other internal risk controls and processes as well as improve reporting systems and procedures while at the same time maintaining and growing existing businesses and client relationships we may not successfully implement such changes or improvements in an efficient or timely manner or we may discover deficiencies in our existing systems and controls that adversely affect our ability to support and grow our existing businesses and client relationships and could require us to incur additional expenditures to expand our administrative and operational infrastructure if we are unable to maintain and implement improvements to our controls processes and reporting systems and procedures we may lose customers experience compliance and operational problems or incur additional expenditures beyond current projections any one of which could adversely affect our financial results the replacement of libor may adversely affect our business libor and certain other interest rate benchmarks are the subject of recent national international and other regulatory guidance and reform on march the united kingdom administrator of libor announced that the 1month 3month 6month and 12month us dollar libor settings would cease to exist after june and numerous other libor settings including the 1week and 2month us dollar libor settings would cease to exist after december the us federal banking agencies issued a statement in november encouraging banks to transition away from us dollar libor as soon as practicable and to stop entering into new contracts that use us dollar libor by december we began offering three alternative rate indices including sofr ameribor and bsby on our lending products to our customers in the second half of each of these rates indices are international organization of securities commissions compliant and as of december we are no longer originating new loans using any libor index the market transition away from libor to alternative reference rates is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on our business financial condition and results of operations in particular the transition could adversely affect the interest rates received or paid on the value of our liborbased assets and liabilities adversely affect the interest rates received or paid on the value of other securities or financial arrangements given libors role in determining market interest rates globally prompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect of our preparation and readiness for the replacement of libor with an alternative reference rate and result in disputes litigation or other actions with borrowers or counterparties about the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in liborbased contracts and securities the transition away from libor to an alternative reference rate or rates will require the transition to or development of appropriate systems models and analytics to effectively transition our risk management and other processes from liborbased products to those based on the applicable alternative reference rate accordingly managements libor transition team is actively working on the libor transition project despite these efforts the manner and impact of this transition and related developments as well as the effect of these developments on our funding costs investment and trading securities portfolios and business is uncertain and could have a material adverse impact on our profitability our risk management practices may prove to be inadequate or not fully effective our risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and appropriately balance risk and return we have established policies and procedures intended to identify monitor and manage the types of risk to which we are subject including but not limited to credit risk market risk liquidity risk operational risk legal and compliance risk and reputational risk a bod level risk committee approves and reviews our key risk management policies and oversees operation of our risk management framework although we have devoted significant resources to developing our risk management policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future these policies and procedures as well as our risk management techniques may not be fully effective in addition as regulations and the markets in which we operate continue to evolve our risk management framework may not always keep sufficient pace with those changes if our risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate our risks we could suffer unexpected losses or other material adverse impacts management of our risks in some cases depends upon the use of analytical andor forecasting models if the models we use to mitigate these risks are inadequate or are subject to ineffective governance we may incur increased losses in addition there may be risks that exist or that develop in the future that we have not appropriately anticipated identified or mitigated our internal controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented and the accuracy of our judgments and estimates about financial and accounting matters may impact operating results and financial condition our management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls over financial reporting disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures any system of controls and procedures however well designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system are met any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could result in materially inaccurate reported financial statements andor have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition similarly our management makes certain estimates and judgments in preparing our financial statements the quality and accuracy of those estimates and judgments will impact our operating results and financial condition if we are unable to understand and adapt to technological change and implement new technologydriven products and services our business could be adversely affected the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technologydriven products and services we expect that new technologies will continue to emerge and may be superior to or render obsolete the technologies currently used in our products and services our future success depends in part upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands as well as to create additional efficiencies in operations many of our competitors because of their larger size and available capital have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements developing or acquiring new technologies and incorporating them into our products and services may require significant investment take considerable time and ultimately may not be successful we cannot predict which technological developments or innovations will become widely adopted or how those technologies may be regulated we also may not be able to effectively market new technologydriven products and services to our customers failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations legal and compliance risks we operate in a highly regulated environment and the laws and regulations that govern our operations corporate governance executive compensation and accounting principles or changes in them or our failure to comply with them may adversely affect us we are subject to extensive regulation supervision and legislation that govern almost all aspects of our operations intended to protect customers depositors and the dif these laws and regulations among other matters prescribe minimum capital requirements impose limitations on the business activities in which we can engage require monitoring and reporting of suspicious activity and of customers who are perceived to present a heightened risk of money laundering or other illegal activity limit the dividends or distributions that wab can pay to wal or that we can pay to our stockholders restrict the ability of affiliates to guarantee our debt impose certain specific accounting requirements on us that may be more restrictive and may result in greater or earlier charges to earnings or reductions in our capital than does gaap among other things our acquisition of amerihome also significantly increased our operations in the mortgage industry where the scope of applicable regulations has grown in complexity in recent years and may continue to do so under the biden administration as the government continues to prioritize consumer protection measures amerihomes operations are subject to federal state and local laws regulations and judicial and administrative decisions including those designed to discourage predatory lending and regulate collections and servicing practices with respect to mortgage loans compliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly and changes to laws and regulations often impose significant additional compliance costs to the extent we continue to grow and become more complex regulatory oversight and risk and the cost of compliance will likely increase which may adversely affect us see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations supervision and regulation included in this form 10k for a more detailed summary of the regulations and supervision to which we are subject changes to the legal and regulatory framework governing our operations including the passage and continued implementation of the doddfrank act and egrrcpa have drastically revised the laws and regulations under which we operate in general bank regulators have increased their focus on risk management and regulatory compliance and we expect this focus to continue additional compliance requirements may be costly to implement may require additional compliance personnel and may limit our ability to offer competitive products to our customers we are also subject to changes in federal and state law as well as regulations and governmental policies income tax laws and accounting principles regulations affecting banks and other financial institutions are undergoing continuous review and frequently change and the ultimate effect of such changes cannot be predicted regulations and laws may be modified at any time and new legislation may be enacted that will affect us wab and our other subsidiaries any changes in federal and state law as well as regulations and governmental policies income tax laws and accounting principles could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways including ways that may adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations failure to appropriately comply with any such laws regulations or principles or an alleged failure to comply even if we acted in good faith or the alleged failure reflects a difference in interpretation could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies civil money penalties or damage to our reputation all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations state and federal banking agencies periodically conduct examinations of our business including compliance with laws and regulations and our failure to comply with any supervisory actions to which we are or become subject as a result of such examinations may adversely affect us state and federal banking agencies including the frb fdic and cfpb periodically conduct examinations of our business including for compliance with laws and regulations if as a result of an examination a federal agency were to determine that our financial condition capital resources asset quality earnings prospects management liquidity or other aspects of our operations had become unsatisfactory or that we or our management was in violation of any law or regulation the agency may take a number of different remedial or enforcement actions it deems appropriate to remedy such a deficiency these actions include the power to enjoin unsafe or unsound practices to require affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced to direct an increase in our capital to restrict our growth and to assess civil monetary penalties against us andor officers or directors and to remove officers and directors if the fdic concludes that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors it may terminate wabs deposit insurance under arizona law the state banking supervisory authority has many of the same enforcement powers with respect to our statechartered bank the cfpb also has the authority to examine us and to take enforcement actions including the issuance of ceaseanddesist orders or civil monetary penalties against us if it finds that we offer consumer financial products and services in violation of federal consumer financial protection laws or in an unfair deceptive or abusive manner finally our amerihome subsidiary needs to maintain certain state licenses and federal and governmentsponsored agency approvals required to conduct its business and is subject to periodic examinations by such state and federal agencies which can result in increases in administrative costs substantial penalties due to compliance errors or the loss of licenses if we were unable to comply with regulatory directives in the future or if we were unable to comply with the terms of any future supervisory requirements to which we may become subject then we could become subject to a variety of supervisory actions and orders including cease and desist orders prompt corrective actions mous andor other regulatory enforcement actions if our regulators were to take such supervisory actions then we could among other things become subject to restrictions on our ability to enter into acquisitions and develop any new business as well as restrictions on our existing business we also could be required to raise additional capital dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed period of time or both failure to implement the measures in the time frames provided or at all could result in additional orders or penalties from federal and state regulators which could result in one or more of the remedial actions described above in the event we were ultimately unable to comply with the terms of a regulatory enforcement action we could fail and be placed into receivership by the fdic or the chartering agency the terms of any such supervisory action and the consequences associated with any failure to comply therewith could have a material negative effect on our business operating flexibility and financial condition current and proposed regulations addressing consumer privacy and data use and security could increase our costs and impact our reputation we are subject to federal state and local laws related to consumer privacy and data use and security including information safeguard rules under the grammleachbliley act and the california consumer protection act these rules require that financial institutions develop implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the financial institutions size and complexity the nature and scope of the financial institutions activities and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue the united states has experienced a heightened legislative and regulatory focus on privacy and data security including requirements as to consumer notification in the event of data breaches and certain types of security breaches additional regulations in these areas may increase compliance costs which could negatively impact earnings in addition failure to comply with the privacy data use and security laws and regulations to which we are subject including by reason of inadvertent disclosure of confidential information could result in fines sanctions penalties reputational harm loss of consumer confidence and other adverse consequences any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business we could be subject to adverse changes or interpretations of tax laws tax audits or challenges to our tax positions we are subject to federal and applicable state income tax laws and regulations income tax laws and regulations are often complex and require significant judgment in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions changes in tax laws changes in interpretations guidance or regulations that may be promulgated or challenges to judgments or actions that we may take with respect to tax laws could negatively impact our current and future financial performance on september the ways and means committee of the us house of representatives released proposed tax reform legislation which includes an increase in the federal corporate tax rate from to for corporations earning more than million and alters selected provisions of the internal revenue code among other changes at this time we are unable to predict whether this change or any other proposed change in tax law will ultimately be enacted in addition our determination of our tax liability is subject to review by applicable tax authorities in the normal course of business we are routinely subject to examinations and challenges from federal and applicable state and local taxing authorities regarding the amount of taxes due in connection with investments we have made and the businesses in which we have engaged recently federal and state and local taxing authorities have been increasingly aggressive in challenging tax positions taken by financial institutions the challenges made by taxing authorities may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions any such challenges that are not resolved in our favor may adversely affect our effective tax rate tax payments or financial condition certain allegations with respect to the phoenix suns and robert sarver could generate negative publicity for us and cause reputational harm robert sarver our former chief executive officer and current executive chairman of the board of directors is the managing coowner of the phoenix suns national basketball association nba franchise on november espn published a report describing alleged misconduct and inappropriate behavior by mr sarver relating to his role with the phoenix suns after publication of the report the nba announced that it would be conducting a

of common stock to employees and directors under our incentive plan each year the issuance of any additional shares of our common stock or preferred stock or securities convertible into exchangeable for or that represent the right to receive common stock or the exercise of such securities could be substantially dilutive to stockholders of our common stock holders of our common stock and preferred stock have no preemptive rights that entitle such holders to purchase their pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series because our decision to issue securities in the future will depend on market conditions our acquisition activity and other factors we cannot predict or estimate the amount timing or nature of our future offerings thus our stockholders bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting their stock holdings in us there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase stock as we have in the past we have paid regular quarterly dividends on our common stock since the third quarter of subject to quarterly declarations by the bod and also have paid dividends on our preferred
