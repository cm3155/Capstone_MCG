information future events or otherwise recent banking industry and market developments the closures of silicon valley bank and signature bank have caused significant disruption in the united states banking industry particularly among midsize banks such as the company these bank closures triggered a surge in deposit outflows and stock price volatility at many midsized banks the frb announced the

securities and other qualifying assets as collateral valued at par under this program the bank has access to billion in borrowing capacity of which billion was drawn at march additionally the department of the treasury frb and fdic issued a joint statement relating to the resolution of silicon valley bank and signature bank which stated that losses to support uninsured deposits of those

capital and liquidity while the company believes it has sufficient capital funding and access to contingent sources of liquidity the company has taken several actions to ensure the strength of its capital and liquidity position these actions included sale of selected assets including million of afs securities and million of loans as well as transfer of billion of loans to hfs net of a pretax

million on sales of investment securities and a million gain on extinguishment of debt the continued uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of the volatility in the banking industry and related economic effects will continue to affect the companys estimate of its allowance for credit losses and resulting provision for credit losses to the extent the impact of the recent banking industry volatility is prolonged and economic conditions worsen or persist longer than forecast such estimates may be insufficient and may change significantly in the future the companys net interest margin also may be negatively impacted in future periods if the companys borrowings remain elevated these uncertainties and the economic environment will continue to affect earnings growth and may result in deterioration of asset quality in the companys loan and investment portfolios depositors in the technology industry are generally considered to be the most impacted by recent events and may have greater sensitivity to the recent volatility in the banking industry with potentially longer recovery periods than other types of businesses the companys deposit exposure to the technology industry totaled billion or of total deposits as of march asset valuation continued and sustained declines in the companys stock price andor other liquidity related impacts such as increases in

following discussion and analysis contains financial information determined by methods other than those prescribed by gaap the companys management uses these nongaap financial measures in their analysis of the companys performance management believes presentation of these nongaap financial measures provides useful supplemental information that is essential to a complete understanding of the operating results of the company since the presentation of these nongaap performance measures and their impact differ between companies these nongaap disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with gaap nor are they necessarily comparable to nongaap performance measures that may be presented by other companies preprovision net revenue banking regulations define ppnr as the sum of net interest income and noninterest income less expenses before adjusting for loss provisions and has been further adjusted for nonoperating items management believes that this is an important metric as it illustrates the underlying performance of the company it enables investors and others to assess the companys ability to generate capital to cover credit

financial measures related to regulatory capital under basel iii which includes cet1 and total capital the frb and other banking regulators use cet1 and total capital as a basis for assessing a banks capital adequacy therefore management believes it is useful to assess financial condition and capital adequacy using this same basis specifically the total capital ratio takes into consideration the risk levels of assets and offbalance sheet financial instruments in addition management believes that the classified assets to cet1 plus allowance measure is an important regulatory metric for assessing asset quality as permitted by the regulatory capital rules the company elected to delay the estimated impact of cecl on its regulatory capital over a fiveyear transition period ending
