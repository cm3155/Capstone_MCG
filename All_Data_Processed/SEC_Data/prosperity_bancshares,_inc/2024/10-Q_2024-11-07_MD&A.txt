the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the company to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements an accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements estimates are made using facts and circumstances known at a point in time changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates the companys accounting policies are described in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements included in the companys annual report on form 10k for the year ended december the company believes that of its significant accounting policies the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity business combinations generally acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc business combinations a business combination occurs when the company acquires net assets that constitute a business and obtains control over that business business combinations are effected through the transfer of consideration consisting of cash andor common stock and are accounted for using the acquisition method accordingly the assets and liabilities of the acquired business are recorded at their respective fair values at the acquisition date determining the fair value of assets and liabilities especially the loan portfolio is a process involving significant judgment regarding methods and assumptions used to calculate estimated fair values fair values are subject to refinement for up to one year after the closing date of the acquisition as information relative to closing date fair values becomes available the results of operations of an acquired entity are included in the companys consolidated results from the acquisition date and prior periods are not restated allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses is accounted for in accordance with fasb asc measurement of credit losses on financial instruments which replaced the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology that is referred to as the current expected credit loss cecl methodology cecl requires a financial asset or a group of financial assets measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected the allowance for credit losses is an allowance available for losses on loans and heldtomaturity securities the allowance for credit losses is adjusted through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for credit losses all losses are charged to the allowance when the loss actually occurs or when a determination is made that such a loss is likely and can be reasonably estimated recoveries are credited to the allowance at the time of recovery the companys allowance for credit losses consists of two elements specific valuation allowances based on expected losses on impaired loans and certain purchased creditdeteriorated loans pcd loans and a general valuation allowance based on historical lifetime loan loss experience current economic conditions reasonable and supportable forecasted economic conditions and other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the company management has established an allowance for credit losses which it believes is adequate for estimated losses in the companys loan portfolio based on an evaluation of the portfolio management presents a quarterly review of the allowance for credit losses to the banks board of directors indicating any change in the allowance since the last review and any recommendations as to adjustments in the allowance in making its evaluation management considers factors such as historical lifetime loan loss experience the amount of nonperforming assets and related collateral the volume growth and composition of the portfolio current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasted economic conditions that may affect borrower ability to pay and the value of collateral the evaluation of the portfolio through its internal loan review process and other relevant factors portions of the allowance may be allocated for specific credits however the entire allowance is available for any credit that in managements judgment should be charged off chargeoffs occur when loans are deemed to be uncollectible pursuant to the companys adoption of asu effective january the company prospectively discontinued troubled debt restructurings accounting and no longer measures the economic concession for loan modifications occurring on or after the adoption date in addition modifications to loans previously designated as troubled debt restructurings that occur on or after january are accounted for under asu and result in the elimination of any prior economic concession recorded in the allowance related to such loans for further discussion of the methodology used in the determination of the allowance for credit losses on loans see accounting

originated by the company and made pursuant to the companys loan policy and procedures in effect at the time the loan was made and acquired loans which are loans acquired in a business combination and recorded at fair value at acquisition date those acquired loans that are renewed or substantially modified after the date of the business combination are referred to as reunderwritten acquired loans if a renewal or substantial modification of an acquired loan is underwritten by the company with a new credit analysis the loan may no longer be categorized as an acquired loan for example acquired loans to one borrower may be combined into a new loan with a new loan number and categorized as an originated loan acquired loans with a fair value discount or premium at the date of the business combination that remained at the reporting date are referred to as fairvalued acquired loans all fairvalued acquired loans are further categorized into pcd loans and nonpcd loans acquired loans with evidence of credit quality deterioration as of the acquisition date when compared to the origination date are classified as pcd loans the following tables summarize the companys originated and acquired loan portfolios broken out into originated loans reunderwritten acquired loans nonpcd loans and pcd loans as of the dates indicated september acquired loans originated loans reunderwritten

million of loans held for sale and billion of warehouse purchase program loans compared with million of loans held for sale and million of warehouse purchase program loans at december at september loans represented of total assets compared with of total assets at december the loan portfolio consists of various types of loans categorized by major type as follows i commercial and industrial loans in nearly all cases the companys commercial loans are made in the companys market areas and are underwritten based on the borrowers ability to service the debt from income working capital loans are primarily collateralized by shortterm assets whereas term loans are primarily collateralized by longterm assets as a general practice term loans are secured by any available real estate equipment or other assets owned by the borrower both working capital and term loans are typically supported by a personal guaranty of a principal in general commercial loans involve more credit risk than residential mortgage loans and commercial mortgage loans and therefore usually yield a higher return the increased risk in commercial loans is due to the type of collateral securing these loans as well as the expectation that commercial loans generally will be serviced principally from the operations of the business and those operations may not be successful historical trends have shown these types of loans to have higher delinquencies than mortgage loans as a result of these additional complexities variables and risks commercial loans require more thorough underwriting and servicing than other types of loans included in commercial and industrial loans are commitments to oil and gas producers largely secured by proven developed and producing reserves and commitments to service equipment and midstream companies secured mainly by accounts receivable inventory and equipment mineral reserve values supporting commitments to producers are normally redetermined semiannually using reserve studies prepared by a thirdparty or the companys oil and gas engineer accounts receivable and inventory borrowing bases for service companies are typically redetermined monthly funding requests by both producers and service companies are monitored relative to the most recently determined borrowing base ii commercial real estate the company makes commercial real estate loans collateralized by owneroccupied and nonowneroccupied real estate to finance the purchase of real estate the companys commercial real estate loans are collateralized by first liens on real estate typically have variable interest rates or five year or less fixed rates and amortize over a to 25year period payments on loans secured by nonowneroccupied properties are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties accordingly repayment of these loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy to a greater extent than other types of loans the company seeks to minimize these risks in a variety of ways including giving careful consideration to the propertys operating history future operating projections current and projected occupancy location and physical condition in connection with underwriting these loans the underwriting analysis also includes credit verification analysis of global cash flow appraisals and a review of the financial condition of the borrower and guarantor loans to hotels and restaurants are included in commercial real estate loans iii family residential loans the companys lending activities also include the origination of family residential mortgage loans including home equity loans collateralized by owneroccupied and nonowneroccupied residential properties located in the companys market areas the company offers a variety of mortgage loan portfolio products which generally are amortized over five to years loans collateralized by family residential real estate generally have been originated in amounts of no more than of appraised value the company requires mortgage title insurance as well as hazard wind andor flood insurance as appropriate the company prefers to retain residential mortgage loans for its own account rather than selling them into the secondary market by doing so the company incurs interest rate risk as well as the risks associated with nonpayments on such loans the companys mortgage department also offers a variety of mortgage loan products which are generally amortized over years including fha and va loans which are sold to secondary market investors iv construction land development and other land loans the company makes loans to finance the construction of residential and nonresidential properties construction loans generally are collateralized by first liens on real estate and have variable interest rates the company conducts periodic inspections either directly or through an agent prior to approval of periodic draws on these loans underwriting guidelines similar to those described above are also used in the companys construction lending activities with heightened analysis of construction andor development costs construction loans involve additional risks attributable to the fact that loan funds are advanced upon the security of a project under construction and the project is of uncertain value prior to its completion because of uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation on real property it can be difficult to accurately evaluate the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan to value ratio as a result of these uncertainties construction lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent in part on the success of the ultimate project rather than the ability of a borrower or guarantor to repay the loan if the company is forced to foreclose on a project prior to completion the company may not be able to recover all of the unpaid portion of the loan in addition the company may be required to fund additional amounts to complete a project and may have to hold the property for an indeterminate period of time although the company has underwriting procedures designed to identify what it believes to be acceptable levels of risks in construction lending these procedures may not prevent losses from the risks described above v warehouse purchase program the warehouse purchase program allows unaffiliated mortgage originators clients to close family real estate loans in their own name and manage their cash flow needs until the loans are sold to investors the companys clients are strategically targeted for their experienced management teams and analyzed for the expected profitability of each clients business model over the long term the clients are located across the us and originate mortgage loans primarily through traditional retail andor wholesale business models using underwriting standards as required by united states governmentsponsored enterprise agencies agencies such as the federal national mortgage association fannie mae private investors to which the mortgage loans are ultimately sold andor mortgage insurers although not subject to any legally binding commitment when the company makes a purchase decision it acquires a participation interest in the mortgage loans originated by its clients individual mortgage loans are warehoused in the companys portfolio only for a short duration averaging less than days when instructed by a client that a warehoused loan has been sold to an investor the company delivers the note to the investor that pays the company which in turn remits the net sales proceeds to the client vi agriculture loans the company provides agriculture loans for shortterm livestock and crop production including rice cotton milo and corn farm equipment financing and agriculture real estate financing the company evaluates agriculture borrowers primarily based on their historical profitability level of experience in their particular industry segment overall financial capacity and the availability of secondary collateral to withstand economic and natural variations common to the industry because agriculture loans present a higher level of risk associated with events caused by nature the company routinely makes onsite visits and inspections in order to identify and monitor such risks vii consumer loans consumer loans made by the company include direct acredit automobile loans recreational vehicle loans boat loans home improvement loans personal loans collateralized and uncollateralized and deposit account collateralized loans the terms of these loans typically range from to months and vary based upon the nature of collateral and size of loan generally consumer loans entail greater risk than do real estate secured loans particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or collateralized by rapidly depreciating assets such as automobiles in such cases any repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan balance the remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower beyond obtaining a deficiency judgment in addition consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrowers continuing financial stability and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss divorce illness personal bankruptcy or death furthermore the application of various federal and state laws may limit the amount which can be recovered on such loans the company maintains an independent loan review department that reviews and validates the credit risk program on a periodic basis results of these reviews are presented to management the loan review process complements and reinforces the risk identification and assessment decisions made by lenders and credit personnel as well as the companys policies and procedures nonperforming assets nonperforming assets include loans on nonaccrual status accruing loans days or more past due repossessed assets and real estate which has been acquired through foreclosure and is awaiting disposition nonperforming assets do not include pcd loans unless the loan has deteriorated since the acquisition date the company generally places a loan on nonaccrual status and ceases accruing interest when the payment of principal or interest is delinquent for days or earlier in some cases unless the loan is in the process of collection and the underlying collateral fully supports the carrying value of the loan a loan may be returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future principal and interest amounts contractually due are reasonably assured which is typically evidenced by a sustained period at least six months of repayment performance by the borrower nonperforming assets increased million to million at september compared with million at december with a significant portion of the balance for each period attributable to acquired loans the following tables present information regarding nonperforming assets differentiated among originated loans reunderwritten acquired loans

nonperforming warehouse purchase program loans or warehouse purchase program lines of credit for the periods presented nonperforming assets were of total loans and other real estate at september and of total loans and other real estate at december the allowance for credit losses on loans as a percentage of total nonperforming loans was at september and at december allowance for credit losses on loans the allowance for credit losses is adjusted through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for credit losses management has established an allowance for credit losses on loans which it believes is adequate as of september for estimated losses in the companys loan portfolio the amount of the allowance for credit losses on loans is affected by the following chargeoffs of loans that occur when loans are deemed uncollectible and decrease the allowance recoveries on loans previously charged off that increase the allowance provisions for credit losses charged to earnings that increase the allowance and provision releases returned to earnings that decrease the allowance based on an evaluation of the loan portfolio and consideration of the factors listed below management presents a quarterly review of the allowance for credit losses to the banks board of directors indicating any change in the allowance since the last review and any recommendations as to adjustments in the allowance although management believes it uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the allowance for credit losses future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions or borrower performance differ from the assumptions used in making the initial determinations the companys allowance for credit losses on loans consists of two components a specific valuation allowance based on expected lifetime losses on specifically identified loans and a general valuation allowance based on historical lifetime loan loss experience current economic conditions reasonable and supportable forecasted economic conditions and other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the company in setting the specific valuation allowance the company follows a loan review program to evaluate the credit risk in the total loan portfolio and assigns risk grades to each loan through this loan review process the company maintains an internal list of impaired loans which along with the delinquency list of loans helps management assess the overall quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses all loans that have been identified as impaired are reviewed on a quarterly basis in order to determine whether a specific reserve is required for certain impaired loans the company allocates a specific loan loss reserve primarily based on the value of the collateral securing the impaired loan the specific reserves are determined on an individual loan basis loans for which specific reserves are provided are excluded from the general valuation allowance described below in determining the amount of the general valuation allowance management considers factors such as historical lifetime loan loss experience concentration risk of specific loan types the volume growth and composition of the companys loan portfolio current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasted economic conditions that may affect borrower ability to pay and the value of collateral the evaluation of the companys loan portfolio through its internal loan review process other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the company and other relevant factors historical lifetime loan loss experience is determined by utilizing an openpool cumulative loss rate methodology adjustments to the historical lifetime loan loss experience are made for differences in current loan pool risk characteristics such as portfolio concentrations delinquency nonaccrual and watch list levels as well as changes in current and forecasted economic conditions such as unemployment rates property and collateral values and other indices relating to economic activity the utilization of reasonable and supportable forecasts includes an immediate reversion to lifetime historical loss rates based on a review of these factors for each loan type the company applies an estimated percentage to the outstanding balance of each loan type excluding any loan that has a specific reserve allocation of a portion of the allowance to one category of loans does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other categories a change in the allowance for credit losses can be attributable to several factors most notably specific reserves identified for impaired loans historical lifetime credit loss information changes in current and forecasted environmental factors and growth in the balance of loans changes in the companys asset quality are reflected in the allowance in several ways specific reserves that are calculated on a loanbyloan basis and the qualitative assessment of all other loans reflect current changes in the credit quality of the loan portfolio historical lifetime credit losses on the other hand are based on an openpool cumulative loss rate methodology which is then applied to estimate lifetime credit losses in the loan portfolio a deterioration in the credit quality of the loan portfolio in the current period would increase the historical lifetime loss rate to be applied in future periods just as an improvement in credit quality would decrease the historical lifetime loss rate the allowance for credit losses is further determined by the size of the loan portfolio subject to the allowance methodology and environmental factors that include companyspecific risk indicators and general economic conditions both of which are constantly changing the company evaluates the economic and portfoliospecific factors on a quarterly basis to determine a qualitative component of the general valuation allowance the factors include current economic metrics reasonable and supportable forecasted economic metrics business conditions delinquency trends credit concentrations nature and volume of the portfolio and other adjustments for items not covered by specific reserves and historical lifetime loss experience managements assessment of qualitative factors is a statistically based approach to determine the loss rate adjustment associated with such factors based on the companys actual historical lifetime loan loss experience relative to economic and loan portfoliospecific factors at the time the losses occurred management is able to identify the expected level of lifetime losses as of the date of measurement the correlation of historical loss experience with current and forecasted economic conditions provides an estimate of lifetime losses that has not been previously factored into the general valuation allowance by the determination of specific reserves and lifetime historical losses additionally the company considers qualitative factors not easily quantified and the possibility of model imprecision utilizing the aggregation of specific reserves historical loss experience and a qualitative component management is able to determine the valuation allowance to reflect the full lifetime loss the company accounts for its acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting accordingly the assets including loans and liabilities of the acquired entity are recorded at their fair values at the acquisition date these fair value estimates associated with acquired loans and based on a discounted cash flow model include estimates related to market interest rates and undiscounted projections of future cash flows that incorporate expectations of prepayments and the amount and timing of principal interest and other cash flows as well as any shortfalls thereof nonpcd loans that were not deemed impaired subsequent to the acquisition date are considered nonimpaired and are evaluated as part of the general valuation allowance nonpcd loans that have deteriorated to an impaired status subsequent to acquisition are evaluated for a specific reserve on a quarterly basis which when identified is added to the allowance for credit losses the company reviews impaired nonpcd loans on a loanbyloan basis and determines the specific reserve based on the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and one of three factors expected future cash flows observable market price or fair value of the collateral because essentially all of the companys impaired nonpcd loans have been collateraldependent the amount of the specific reserve historically has been determined by comparing the fair value of the collateral securing the nonpcd loan with the recorded investment in such loan in the future the company will continue to analyze impaired nonpcd loans on a loanbyloan basis and may use an alternative measurement method to determine the specific reserve as appropriate and in accordance with applicable accounting standards pcd loans are monitored individually or on a pooled basis quarterly to assess for changes in expected cash flows subsequent to acquisition if a deterioration in cash flows is identified an increase to the pcd reserves for that individual loan or pool of loans is made pcd loans were recorded at their acquisition date fair values which were based on expected cash flows and considers estimates of expected future credit losses the companys estimates of loan fair values at the acquisition date may be adjusted for a period of up to one year as the company continues to evaluate its estimate of expected future cash flows at the acquisition date if the company determines that losses arose after the acquisition date the additional losses will be reflected as a provision for credit losses see critical accounting estimates above for more information as described in the section captioned critical accounting estimates above the companys determination of the allowance for credit losses involves a high degree of judgment and complexity the companys analysis of qualitative or environmental factors on pools of loans with common risk characteristics in combination with the quantitative historical lifetime loss information and specific reserves provides the company with an estimate of lifetime losses the allowance must reflect changes in the balance of loans subject to the allowance methodology as well as the estimated lifetime losses associated with those loans the following tables present as of and for the periods indicated information regarding the allowance for credit losses on loans differentiated between originated loans and acquired loans

losses in future periods which could be substantial in relation to the size of the allowance at september allowance for credit losses on offbalance sheet credit exposures the allowance for credit losses on offbalance sheet credit exposures estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which there is exposure to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit except

expected credit losses by segregating the portfolio into two general classifications and applying the appropriate expected credit losses methodology investment securities classified as available for sale or held to maturity are evaluated for expected credit losses under fasb asc financial instruments credit losses available for sale securities for available for sale securities in an unrealized loss position the amount of the expected credit losses recognized in earnings depends on whether an entity intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any currentperiod credit loss if an entity intends to sell or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any currentperiod credit loss the expected credit losses will be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investments amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date if an entity does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any currentperiod loss the expected credit losses will be separated into the amount representing the creditrelated portion of the impairment loss credit loss and the noncredit portion of the impairment loss noncredit portion the amount of the total expected credit losses related to the credit loss is determined based on the difference between the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis and such difference is recognized in earnings the amount of the total expected credit losses related to the noncredit portion is recognized in other comprehensive income net of applicable taxes the previous amortized cost basis less the expected credit losses recognized in earnings will become the new amortized cost basis of the investment as of september management does not have the intent to sell any of the securities classified as available for sale before a recovery of cost in addition management believes it is more likely than not that the company will not be required to sell any of its investment securities before a recovery of cost the unrealized losses are largely due to changes in market interest rates and spread relationships since the time the underlying securities were purchased the fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity date or repricing date or if market yields for such investments decline management does not believe any of the securities are impaired due to reasons of credit quality accordingly as of september management believes that there is no potential for credit losses on available for sale securities held to maturity securities the companys held to maturity investments include mortgagerelated bonds issued by either the government national mortgage corporation ginnie mae fannie mae or federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac ginnie mae issued securities are explicitly guaranteed by the us government while fannie mae and freddie mac
