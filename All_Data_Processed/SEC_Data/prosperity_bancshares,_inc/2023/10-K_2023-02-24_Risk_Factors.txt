item risk fa ctors an investment in the companys common stock involves risks the following is a description of the material risks and uncertainties that the company believes affect its business and an investment in the common stock additional risks and uncertainties that the company is unaware of or that it currently deems immaterial also may become important factors that affect the company and its business if any of the risks described in this annual report on form 10k were to occur the companys financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if this were to happen the value of the common stock could decline significantly and all or part of an investment could be lost risks associated with the companys business interest rate risks the companys business is subject to interest rate risk and fluctuations in interest rates may adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations the majority of the companys assets are monetary in nature and as a result the company is subject to significant risk from changes in interest rates changes in interest rates can impact the companys net interest income as well as the valuation of its assets and liabilities the companys earnings are significantly dependent on its net interest income net interest income is the difference between the interest income earned on loans investments and other interestearning assets and the interest expense paid on deposits borrowings and other interestbearing liabilities interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the companys control including general economic conditions inflationary trends changes in government spending and debt issuances and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and in particular the federal open market committee changes in monetary policy including changes in interest rates could influence the interest the company receives on loans and securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings and could also affect the companys ability to originate loans such as decreased demand due to higher interest rates and obtain deposits the fair value of the companys financial assets and liabilities and the average duration of the companys mortgagebacked securities portfolio if the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments the companys net interest income and therefore earnings could be adversely affected earnings also could be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments decrease more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings further the companys assets and liabilities may react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions because there may be mismatches between the repricing or maturity characteristics of the assets and liabilities any substantial unexpected prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the companys business financial condition and results of operations the company may be adversely impacted by the transition from libor as a reference rate the united kingdoms financial conduct authority and the administrator of libor have announced that the publication of the most commonly used us dollar london interbank offered rate libor settings will cease to be published or cease to be representative after june the publication of all other libor settings ceased to be published as of december given consumer protection litigation and reputation risks the bank regulatory agencies have indicated that entering into new contracts that use libor as a reference rate after december would create safety and soundness risks and that they will examine bank practices accordingly the adjustable interest rate libor act enacted in march provides a statutory framework to replace us dollar libor with a benchmark rate based on the secured overnight financing rate sofr for contracts governed by us law that have no or ineffective fallbacks and in december the federal reserve board adopted related implementing rules although governmental authorities have endeavored to facilitate an orderly discontinuation of libor no assurance can be provided that this aim will be achieved or that the use level and volatility of libor or other interest rates or the value of liborbased securities will not be adversely affected as a result and despite the enactment of the libor act for the most commonly used libor settings the use or selection of a successor rate could expose the company to risks associated with disputes and litigation with the companys customers and counterparties and other market participants in connection with implementing libor fallback provisions the majority of loans originally priced based on a libor index were converted to either a sofr or bsby bloomberg index services index prior to december the remaining liborpriced loans are expected to be converted to an alternative index prior to june the bank is coordinating with customers to implement an orderly change of loan pricing indices without undue disruption to the banks customers or its lending processes as of december approximately million of the companys outstanding loans and certain derivative contracts borrowings and other financial instruments have attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on libor the company is subject to litigation and reputational risks if it is unable to renegotiate and amend the remaining existing contracts with counterparties that are dependent on libor including contracts that do not have fallback language the timing and manner in which each customers contract transitions to a replacement rate will vary on a casebycase basis interest payments under contracts referencing new indices will differ from those referencing a libor index since any replacement rate will change interest payment calculations failure to complete an orderly transition prior to june could adversely affect customer relationships and the companys business financial condition and results of operations credit and lending risks the companys business depends on its ability to successfully manage credit risk the companys business depends on its ability to successfully measure and manage credit risk as a lender the company is exposed to the risk that the principal of or interest on a loan will not be repaid timely or at all or that the value of any collateral supporting a loan will be insufficient to cover the companys outstanding exposure in addition the company is exposed to risks with respect to the period of time over which the loan may be repaid risks relating to proper loan underwriting risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions and risks inherent in dealing with individual loans and borrowers the creditworthiness of a borrower is affected by many factors including local market conditions and general economic conditions if the overall economic climate in the united states generally or the companys market areas specifically experiences material disruption the companys borrowers may experience difficulties in repaying their loans the collateral the company holds may decrease in value or become illiquid and the level of nonperforming loans chargeoffs and delinquencies could rise and require significant additional provisions for credit losses additional factors related to the credit quality of commercial loans include the quality of the management of the business and the borrowers ability to properly evaluate changes in the supply and demand characteristics affecting their market for products and services to evaluate regulatory changes affecting their products and services such as climate change regulation and to effectively respond to those changes additional factors related to the credit quality of commercial real estate loans include tenant vacancy rates and the quality of management of the property in addition financial markets and global supply chains may be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of military conflict including the current russian invasion of ukraine terrorism or other geopolitical events current economic conditions are significantly affected by elevated levels of inflation and rising interest rates a prolonged period of inflation may adversely affect the companys profitability by causing fixed costs and expenses to increase meanwhile economic and inflationary pressure on consumers and uncertainty regarding the prospects for economic improvement could alter consumer and business spending borrowing and savings habits such conditions could have a material adverse effect on the credit quality of the companys loans and on the companys business financial condition and results of operations furthermore evolving responses from federal and state governments and other regulators and the companys customers or vendors to new challenges such as climate change have impacted and could continue to impact the economic and political conditions under which the company operates which could have a material adverse effect on the companys business financial condition and results of operations the companys risk management practices such as monitoring the concentration of the companys loans within specific industries and the companys credit approval review and administrative practices may not adequately reduce credit risk and the companys credit administration personnel policies and procedures may not adequately adapt to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting customers and the quality of the loan portfolio many of the companys loans are made to businesses that are less able to withstand competitive economic and financial pressures than larger borrowers consequently the company may have significant exposure if any of these borrowers becomes unable to pay their loan obligations as a result of economic or market conditions or personal circumstances such as divorce or death a failure to effectively measure and limit the credit risk associated with the companys loan portfolio may result in loan defaults foreclosures and additional chargeoffs and may necessitate that the company significantly increase its allowance for credit losses each of which could adversely affect the companys net income as a result the companys inability to successfully manage credit risk could have a material adverse effect on the companys business financial condition and results of operations the companys allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover actual credit losses which could adversely affect its earnings as a lender the company is exposed to the risk that its loan customers may not repay their loans according to the terms of these loans and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to fully compensate the company for the outstanding balance of the loan plus the costs to dispose of the collateral the company maintains an allowance for credit losses in an attempt to cover estimated losses inherent in its loan portfolio additional credit losses could occur in the future and may occur at a rate greater than the company has experienced to date the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires the company to make significant estimates of current credit risks future trends and general economic conditions including inflation and recession all of which may undergo material changes if the companys assumptions prove to be incorrect or if it experiences significant credit losses in future periods its current allowance may not be sufficient to cover actual credit losses and adjustments may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in its loan portfolio a material addition to the allowance could cause net income and possibly capital to decrease in addition federal and state regulators periodically review the companys allowance for credit losses and may require the company to increase its provision for credit losses or recognize further chargeoffs based on judgments different than those of the companys management an increase in the companys allowance for credit losses or chargeoffs as required by these regulatory agencies could have a material adverse effect on the companys operating results and financial condition the financial accounting standards boards accounting standard asu which established allowances for credit losses became effective for the company on january this methodology known as cecl reflects the expected credit losses over the lives of financial assets starting when such assets are first acquired under this methodology credit losses are measured based on past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of financial assets the standard resulted in an increase to allowance and required the application of the revised methodology to existing financial assets through a onetime adjustment to retained earnings see notes to consolidated financial statementsnote 1nature of operations and summary of significant accounting and reporting policies the companys profitability depends significantly on local economic conditions the companys success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the primary markets in texas and oklahoma in which it operates and where its loans are concentrated the local economic conditions in texas and oklahoma have a significant impact on the companys commercial real estate and construction land development and other land loans the ability of its borrowers to repay their loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans accordingly if the population or income growth in the companys market areas is slower than projected income levels deposits and housing starts could be adversely affected and could result in a reduction of the companys expansion growth and profitability in addition due to the large number of oil and gas companies in the companys market areas the volatility in oil prices may negatively impact economic conditions in these areas if the companys market areas experience a downturn or a recession for a prolonged period of time the company could experience significant increases in nonperforming loans which could lead to operating losses impaired liquidity and eroding capital a significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation an increase or decline in commodity prices recession weather extremes acts of terrorism outbreaks of hostilities or other international or domestic calamities unemployment or other factors could impact these local economic conditions and could negatively affect the companys financial condition results of operations and cash flows the companys dependence on loans secured by real estate subjects it to risks relating to fluctuations in the real estate market that could adversely affect its financial condition results of operations and cash flows approximately of the companys total loans as of december consisted of loans included in the real estate loan portfolio with in commercial real estate including farmland and multifamily residential in residential real estate including home equity and in construction land development and other land loans the real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended a weakening of the real estate market in the companys primary market areas could have an adverse effect on the demand for new loans the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans the value of real estate and other collateral securing the loans and the value of real estate owned by the company if real estate values decline it is also more likely that the company would be required to increase its allowance for credit losses which could adversely affect its financial condition results of operations and cash flows the companys commercial real estate and commercial loans expose it to increased credit risks and these risks will increase if the company succeeds in increasing these types of loans the company while maintaining its conservative approach to lending has emphasized both new and existing loan products focusing on managing its commercial real estate including farmland and multifamily residential and commercial loan portfolios and intends to continue to increase its lending activities and acquire loans in possible future acquisitions as a result commercial real estate and commercial loans as a proportion of its portfolio could increase as of december commercial real estate including farmland and multifamily residential and commercial loans totaled billion in general commercial real estate loans and commercial loans yield higher returns and often generate a deposit relationship but also pose greater credit risks than do owneroccupied residential real estate loans these types of loans are also typically larger than residential real estate loans accordingly the deterioration of one or several of these loans could cause a significant increase in nonperforming loans which could result in a loss of earnings from these loans and an increase in the provision for credit losses and net chargeoffs the company makes both secured and some unsecured commercial loans unsecured loans generally involve a higher degree of risk of loss than do secured loans because without collateral repayment is wholly dependent upon the success of the borrowers businesses secured commercial loans are generally collateralized by accounts receivable inventory equipment or other assets owned by the borrower and include a personal guaranty of the business owner compared to real estate that type of collateral is more difficult to monitor its value is harder to ascertain it may depreciate more rapidly and it may not be as readily saleable if repossessed further commercial loans generally will be serviced primarily from the operation of the business which may not be successful while commercial real estate loans generally will be serviced from income on the properties securing the loans as the companys various commercial loan portfolios increase the corresponding risks and potential for losses from these loans will also increase the company may be adversely affected by weaknesses in the commercial real estate market as of december commercial real estate loans including multifamily residential and excluding farmland comprised approximately of the companys loan portfolio commercial real estate loans generally involve a greater degree of credit risk than residential real estate loans because they typically have larger balances and are more affected by adverse conditions in the economy because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate often depend upon the successful operation and management of the properties and the businesses which operate from within them repayment of such loans may be affected by factors outside the borrowers control such as adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy or changes in government regulations commercial real estate markets have been impacted by the economic disruptions caused by the covid19 pandemic the covid19 pandemic has also been a catalyst for the evolution of various remote work options that could have an adverse effect on the longterm performance of some types of office properties within the companys commercial real estate portfolio a failure by the company to have adequate risk management policies procedures and controls could adversely affect the companys ability to increase this portfolio going forward and could result in an increased rate of delinquencies in and increased losses from this portfolio which accordingly could have a material adverse effect on the companys business financial condition and results of operations the companys warehouse purchase program balances can fluctuate widely because warehouse purchase program balances are contingent upon residential mortgage lending activity changes in the residential real estate market nationwide can lead to wide fluctuations of balances in this product materially impacting both interest and noninterest income additionally warehouse purchase program periodend balances are generally higher than the average balance during the period due to increased mortgage activity that occurs at the end of a month which can significantly impact the companys reported capital ratios the companys loan portfolio and specifically its energy lending portfolio could be adversely affected by declines in the prices of oil and natural gas as well as other factors loans to oil and gas production and service companies which are reported as commercial and industrial loans totaled million net of discount and excluding ppp loans totaling million at december representing approximately of total loans excluding warehouse purchase program loans as a result the factors that impact the energy sector may have a greater effect on the company than on more broadly diversified financial institutions companies with exposure to the energy sector whether directly or indirectly are subject to volatile fluctuations in price and supply of oil and gas many factors affect the supply of and demand for crude oil and natural gas and therefore influence prices of these commodities including domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas including increased availability of nontraditional energy resources such as shale oil and gas prices and expectations about future prices of oil and natural gas domestic and worldwide economic conditions and the resulting global demand for oil and natural gas the price and quantity of imports of foreign oil and natural gas including the ability of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec to set and maintain production levels for oil and decisions by opec and nonopec producers to change production levels sanctions imposed by the us the european union or other governments against oil producing countries the cost of exploring for developing producing and delivering oil and natural gas the level of excess production capacity available pipeline storage and other transportation capacity lead times associated with acquiring equipment and products and availability of qualified personnel the expected rates of decline in production from existing and prospective wells the discovery rates of new oil and gas reserves federal state and local regulation of exploration and drilling activities and oil and gas exports including climate change regulation legislative and regulatory interest within federal state and local governments to stop significantly limit or regulate hydraulic fracturing activities also known as fracking or emissions weather conditions including hurricanes that can affect oil and natural gas operations over a wide area and severe winter weather that can interfere with oil and gas development and production operations political instability and social unrest throughout the world such as in ukraine and particularly in oil and natural gas producing countries advances in exploration development and production technologies or in technologies affecting energy consumption such as fracking the price and availability of alternative fuel and energy sources the transition to alternate energy sources like wind and solar uncertainty in capital and commodities markets and changes in the value of the us dollar relative to other major global currencies further the economy in texas as a whole could be negatively impacted if there are a high number of jobs lost related to a decline in oil production in the state or if the impact of lower oil prices negatively affects other industries a decline in the texas economy related to oil production decline could impact the companys loan portfolios outside of the energy portfolio if borrowers experience unemployment or loss of income and are unable to make payments on their loans the company is subject to losses resulting from fraudulent and negligent acts on the part of loan applicants correspondents or other third parties the company relies heavily upon information supplied by third parties including the information contained in credit applications property appraisals title information equipment pricing and valuation and employment and income documentation in deciding which loans the company will originate as well as the terms of those loans if any of the information upon which the company relies is misrepresented either fraudulently or inadvertently and the misrepresentation is not detected prior to asset funding the value of the asset may be significantly lower than expected or the company may fund a loan that it would not have funded or on terms it would not have extended whether a misrepresentation is made by the applicant or another third party the company generally bears the risk of loss associated with the misrepresentation a loan subject to a material misrepresentation is typically unsellable or subject to repurchase if it is sold prior to detection of the misrepresentation the sources of the misrepresentations are often difficult to locate and it is often difficult to recover any of the monetary losses the company may suffer the company is subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities a significant portion of the companys loan portfolio is secured by real property during the ordinary course of business the company may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans and there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties if hazardous or toxic substances are found the company may be liable for remediation costs as well as for personal injury and property damage environmental laws may require the company to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected propertys value or limit the companys ability to use or sell the affected property in addition future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase the companys exposure to environmental liability although the company has policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on real property these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards the remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition and results of operations liquidity risks liquidity risk could impair the companys ability to fund operations and jeopardize its financial condition liquidity is essential to the companys business an inability to raise funds through deposits borrowings the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on its liquidity the companys access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance its activities or on terms which are acceptable to it could be impaired by factors that affect the company specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general factors that could detrimentally impact the companys access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of its business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which its loans are concentrated or adverse regulatory action against it the companys ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to it such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry in light of the recent turmoil faced by banking organizations and the continued deterioration in credit markets the company relies on customer deposits as a significant source of funding and its deposits may decrease in the future the company relies on customer deposits as a significant source of funding competition among us banks for customer deposits is intense may increase the cost of deposits or prevent new deposits and may otherwise negatively affect the companys ability to grow its deposit base the companys deposit accounts may decrease in the future and any such decrease could have an adverse impact on the companys sources of funding which impact could be material any changes the company makes to the rates offered on its deposit products to remain competitive with other financial institutions may adversely affect its profitability and liquidity the demand for the deposit products the company offers may also be reduced due to a variety of factors such as demographic patterns changes in customer preferences changes in interest rates payment of interest on demand deposits by other financial institutions reductions in consumers disposable income regulatory actions that decrease customer access to particular products or the availability of competing products including from new financial technology competitors or competitors that provide customers with alternate investment options the company may need to raise additional capital in the future and such capital may not be available when needed on acceptable terms or at all the company may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide it with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet regulatory capital requirements or its commitments and business needs in addition the company may elect to raise additional capital to support its business or to finance acquisitions if any if needed the companys ability to raise additional capital will depend on many things including conditions in the capital markets at that time which are outside its control and its financial performance such capital may not be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all any occurrence that may limit the companys access to the capital markets such as a decline in the confidence of investors depositors of the bank or counterparties participating in the capital markets may adversely affect the companys capital costs and its ability to raise capital and in turn its liquidity moreover if the company needs to raise capital in the future it may have to do so when many other financial institutions are also seeking to raise capital and would have to compete with those institutions for investors an inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on the companys business financial condition and results of operations strategic risks if the company is not able to continue its historical levels of growth it may not be able to maintain its historical earnings trends to achieve its past levels of growth the company has focused on both internal growth and acquisitions the company may not be able to sustain its historical rate of growth or may not be able to grow at all more specifically the company may not be able to obtain the financing necessary to fund additional growth and may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates various factors such as economic conditions competition and heightened regulatory scrutiny may impede or prohibit the opening of new banking centers and the completion of acquisitions further the company may be unable to attract and retain experienced bankers which could adversely affect its internal growth if the company is not able to continue its historical levels of growth it may not be able to maintain its historical earnings trends if the company is unable to manage its growth effectively its operations and profitability could be negatively affected the company faces a variety of risks and difficulties pursuing its growth strategy including finding suitable markets for expansion finding suitable candidates for acquisition attracting funding to support additional growth maintaining asset quality attracting and retaining qualified management managing execution risks maintaining adequate regulatory capital and scaling technology platforms in addition in order to manage its growth and maintain adequate information and reporting systems within its organization the company must identify hire and retain additional qualified associates particularly in the accounting and operational areas of its business if the company does not manage its growth effectively its business financial condition results of operations and future prospects could be negatively affected and the company may not be able to continue to implement its business strategy and successfully conduct its operations if the company is unable to identify and acquire other financial institutions and successfully integrate its acquired businesses its business and earnings may be negatively affected the market for acquisitions remains highly competitive and the company may be unable to find acquisition candidates in the future that fit its acquisition and growth strategy to the extent that the company is unable to find suitable acquisition candidates an important component of its growth strategy may be lost acquisitions of financial institutions such as the pending acquisitions of first bancshares and lone star involve operational risks and uncertainties and acquired companies may have unforeseen liabilities exposure to asset quality problems key employee and customer retention problems and other problems that could negatively affect the companys organization the company may not be able to complete future acquisitions and if completed the company may not be able to successfully integrate the operations management products and services of the entities that it acquires and eliminate redundancies the integration process could result in the loss of key employees or disruption of the combined entitys ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect the companys ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the transaction the integration process may also require significant time and attention from the companys management that they would otherwise direct at servicing existing business and developing new business the companys inability to find suitable acquisition candidates or failure to successfully integrate the entities it acquires into its existing operations may increase its operating costs significantly and adversely affect its business and earnings acquisitions may also result in potential dilution to existing shareholders of the companys earnings per share if the company issues common stock in connection with an acquisition acquisitions may be delayed impeded or prohibited due to regulatory issues acquisitions by financial institutions are subject to approval by a variety of federal and state regulatory agencies the process for obtaining these required regulatory approvals has become substantially more difficult in recent years and may become even more challenging following the review of the merger application process by the federal banking agencies and potentially the cfpb and the review of the competitive effects process by the department of justice regulatory approvals could be delayed impeded restrictively conditioned or denied due to existing or new regulatory issues the company has or may have with regulatory agencies including without limitation issues related to bank secrecy act compliance community reinvestment act issues fair lending laws fair housing laws consumer protection laws unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices regulations and other similar laws and regulations the company may fail to pursue evaluate or complete strategic and competitively significant acquisition opportunities as a result of its inability or perceived or anticipated inability to obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner under reasonable conditions or at all difficulties associated with potential acquisitions that may result from these factors could have a material adverse effect on the companys business financial condition and results of operations if the goodwill that the company recorded in connection with a business acquisition becomes impaired it could require charges to earnings goodwill represents the amount by which the acquisition cost exceeds the fair value of net assets the company acquired in the purchase of another financial institution the company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset might be impaired the company determines impairment by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess any such adjustments are reflected in the companys results of operations in the periods in which they become known at december the companys goodwill totaled billion although the company has not recorded any such impairment charges since it initially recorded the goodwill the companys future evaluations of goodwill could result in findings of impairment and related writedowns which may have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations operational risks the companys accounting estimates and risk management processes rely on analytical and forecasting models and tools that may prove to be inaccurate the processes the company uses to estimate its expected credit losses and to measure the fair value of financial instruments as well as the processes used to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on the companys financial condition and results of operations depend upon the use of analytical and forecasting models and tools these models and tools reflect assumptions that may not be accurate particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances even if these assumptions are accurate the models and tools may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or their implementation any such failure in the companys analytical or forecasting models and tools could have a material adverse effect on the companys business financial condition and results of operations an interruption in or breach in security of the companys information systems may result in a loss of customer business and have an adverse effect on the companys results of operations financial condition and cash flows the company relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business any failure interruption or breach in security of these systems whether caused by physical damage hackers viruses or other malware could jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through the companys computer systems and network infrastructure as well as result in failures or disruptions in the companys customer relationship management general ledger deposits servicing or loan origination systems the amount of specific cyber insurance coverage that the company maintains and expects would apply in the event of various breach scenarios may not be adequate in any particular case in addition cyber threat scenarios are inherently difficult to predict and can take many forms some of which may not be covered under the companys cyber insurance coverage security measures that the company with the help of thirdparty service providers has implemented or intends to continue to implement to prevent damage from cyberattacks may not entirely mitigate these risks in addition increases in cyber threats and the sophistication of bad actors advances in computer capabilities new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms the company and its thirdparty service providers use to protect client transaction data although the company makes significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of its information systems and has implemented various measures to manage the risks of a security breach or disruption there can be no assurance that the companys security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging breaches also may occur as a result of remote working arrangements the occurrence of any such failures interruptions or security breaches could damage the companys reputation result in a loss of customer business subject the company to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose the company to civil litigation and possible financial liability any of which could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations financial condition and cash flows the company is subject to certain risks in connection with its use of technology the financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technologydriven products and services the companys future success depends in part upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as create additional efficiencies in its operations many of the companys competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements the company may not be able to effectively implement new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers which may negatively affect the companys results of operations financial condition and cash flows further as technology advances the ability to initiate transactions and access data has become more widely distributed among mobile devices personal computers automated teller machines remote deposit capture sites and similar access points these technological advances increase cybersecurity risk the companys programs that are intended to prevent or limit the effects of cybersecurity risk may not be sufficient to eliminate all unauthorized transactions or unauthorized access to customer information the financial reputational and regulatory impact of unauthorized transactions or unauthorized access to customer information could be significant the companys operations rely on external vendors which may fail to provide adequate services the company relies on certain external vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain its daytoday operations these third parties provide key components of the companys business operations such as data processing recording and monitoring transactions online banking interfaces and services internet connections and network access but the company does not control their actions any complications caused by these third parties including those resulting from disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes cyberattacks and security breaches at a vendor failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason or poor performance of services could adversely affect the companys ability to deliver products and services to its customers and otherwise conduct its business financial or operational difficulties of a thirdparty vendor could also hurt the companys operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendors ability to provide services furthermore the companys vendors could also be sources of operational and information security risk including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints and reputational risk replacing these thirdparty vendors could also create significant delay and expense problems caused by external vendors could be disruptive to the companys operations which could have a material adverse impact on the companys business and in turn the companys financial condition and results of operations the companys business may be adversely affected by consolidations of technology vendors the company relies on certain external vendors for core products and services consolidations among core vendors may have the effect of decreasing price competition that may lead to higher vendor costs and may also increase systemic risk from vendors that could affect the companys operations the companys business may be adversely affected by security breaches at third parties the companys customers interact with their own and other thirdparty systems which pose operational risks to the company the company may be adversely affected by data breaches at retailers and other third parties who maintain data relating to the companys customers that involve the theft of customer data including the theft of customers debit card credit card wire transfer and other identifying andor access information used to make purchases or payments at such retailers and to other third parties despite thirdparty security risks that are beyond the companys control the company offers its customers protection against fraud and attendant losses for unauthorized use of debit and credit cards in order to stay competitive in the marketplace offering such protection to customers exposes the company to significant expenses and potential losses related to reimbursing the companys customers for fraud losses reissuing the compromised cards and increased monitoring for suspicious activity if a data breach of considerable magnitude were to occur at one or more retailers the companys business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected the companys risk management framework may not be effective in identifying managing or mitigating risks andor losses to it the company has implemented a risk management framework to identify and manage its risk exposure which is reviewed and overseen by the companys risk committee this framework consists of various processes systems and strategies and is designed to manage the types of risk to which the company is subject including among others credit market liquidity operational financial interest rate legal and regulatory compliance strategic reputation fiduciary and general economic risks the companys framework also includes financial or other modeling methodologies which involves management assumptions and judgment in addition under this framework the company has developed a risk appetite statement to detail its risk tolerance levels at an enterprisewide level this risk management framework may not be effective under all circumstances and it may not adequately identify manage or mitigate all or any risk or loss to the company if this framework is not effective the company may be subject to potentially adverse regulatory consequences and could suffer unexpected losses and its financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected the company is subject to risk arising from the failure or circumvention of internal controls and procedures the companys internal controls including fraud detection and controls disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance procedures are based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the controls and procedures are met any failure or circumvention of controls and procedures failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures or failure to comply with corporate governance procedures could have a material adverse effect on the companys reputation business financial condition and results of operations including subjecting us to litigation regulatory fines penalties or other sanctions furthermore notwithstanding the proliferation of technology and technologybased risk and control systems the companys business ultimately relies on people as its greatest resource and the company is subject to the risk that they make mistakes or engage in violations of applicable policies laws rules or procedures that in the past have not and in the future may not always be prevented by the companys technological processes or by the controls and other procedures intended to prevent and detect such errors or violations human errors malfeasance and other misconduct even if promptly discovered and remediated can result in reputational damage
