conjunction with our annual report on regulatory capital requirement is based on the applicable regulatory requirement calculated as of september and december actual capital is determined on an adjusted gaap basis acc is required to hold capital in compliance with the minnesota department of commerce and sec capital requirements actual capital and regulatory capital requirements are determined in accordance with uk regulatory legislation actual capital and regulatory capital requirements are determined in accordance with rules defined under basel iii capital framework as permitted aoci is excluded from the calculation of regulatory capital in october the federal reserve board frb issued its final rule establishing a consolidated capital framework termed the building block approach for savings and loan holding companies like ameriprise financial that are significantly engaged in insurance activities the rule became effective january with reporting to the frb beginning in in addition to the particular regulations restricting dividend payments and establishing subsidiary capitalization requirements we take into account the overall health of the business capital levels and risk management considerations in determining a strategy for payments to our parent holding company from our subsidiaries and in deciding to use cash to make capital contributions to our subsidiaries during the nine months ended september the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of billion including million from ameriprise bank million from riversource life and billion from ampf holding llc and contributed cash to its subsidiaries of million during the nine months ended september the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of billion including million from riversource life and billion from ampf holding llc and contributed cash to its subsidiaries of million in riversource life established an agreement to protect its exposure to genworth life insurance company glic for its reinsured ltc in substantial enhancements to this reinsurance protection agreement were finalized the terms of these confidential provisions within the agreement have been shared in the normal course of regular reviews with our domiciliary regulator and rating agencies glic is domiciled in delaware so in the event glic was subjected to rehabilitation or insolvency proceedings such proceedings would be located in and governed by delaware laws delaware courts have a long tradition of respecting commercial and reinsurance affairs as well as contracts among sophisticated parties similar credit protections to what we have with glic have been tested and respected in delaware and elsewhere in the united states and as a result we believe our credit protections would be respected even in the unlikely event that glic becomes subject to rehabilitation or insolvency proceedings in delaware accordingly while no credit protections are perfect we believe the correct way to think about the risks represented by our ameriprise financial inc counterparty credit exposure to glic is not the full amount of the gross liability that glic reinsures but a much smaller net exposure to glic if any that might exist after taking into account our credit protections thus management believes that our agreement and offsetting nonltc legacy arrangements with genworth financial inc will enable riversource life to recover on all net exposure in all material respects in the event of a rehabilitation or insolvency of glic dividends paid to shareholders and share repurchases we paid regular quarterly dividends to our shareholders totaling million and million for the nine
