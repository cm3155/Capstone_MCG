million favorable change in the marktomarket impact on sharebased compensation expenses and lower investment expenses ameriprise financial inc market risk our primary market risk exposures are interest rate equity price foreign currency exchange rate and credit risk equity price and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other assetbased fees we earn the spread income generated on our fixed deferred annuities fixed insurance brokerage client cash balances banking deposits faceamount certificate products and the fixed portion of our variable annuities and variable insurance contracts the value of dac and dsic assets the value of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the value of derivatives held to hedge these benefits our earnings from fixed deferred annuities fixed insurance and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts are based upon the spread between rates earned on assets held and the rates at which interest is credited to accounts we primarily invest in fixed rate securities to fund the rate credited to clients we guarantee an interest rate to the holders of these products investment assets and client liabilities generally differ as it relates to basis repricing or maturity characteristics rates credited to clients accounts generally reset at shorter intervals than the yield on the underlying investments therefore in an increasing interest rate environment higher interest rates may be reflected in crediting rates to clients sooner than in rates earned on invested assets which could result in a reduced spread between the two rates reduced earned income and a negative impact on pretax income however the current low interest rate environment is resulting in interest rates below the level of some of our liability guaranteed minimum interest rates gmirs hence a modest rise in interest rates would not necessarily result in changes to all the liability credited rates while projected asset purchases would capture the full increase in interest rates this dynamic would result in widening spreads under a modestly rising rate scenario given the current relationship between the current level of interest rates and the underlying gmirs on the business as a result of the low interest rate environment our current reinvestment yields are generally lower than the current portfolio yield we expect our portfolio income yields to continue to decline in future periods if interest rates remain low the carrying value and weighted average yield of nonstructured fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgage loans that may generate proceeds to reinvest through september due to prepayment maturity or call activity at the option of the issuer excluding securities with a makewhole provision were billion and respectively as of march in addition residential mortgage backed securities which are subject to prepayment risk as a result of the low interest rate environment totaled billion and had a weighted average yield of as of march while these amounts represent investments that could be subject to reinvestment risk it is also possible that these investments will be used to fund liabilities or may not be prepaid and will remain invested at their current yields in addition to the interest rate environment the mix of benefit payments versus product sales as well as the timing and volumes associated with such mix may impact our investment yield furthermore reinvestment activities and the associated investment yield may also be impacted by corporate strategies implemented at managements discretion the average yield for investment purchases during the three months ended march was approximately the reinvestment of proceeds from maturities calls and prepayments at rates below the current portfolio yield which may be below the level of some liability gmirs will have a negative impact to future operating results to mitigate the unfavorable impact that the low interest rate environment has on our spread income we assess reinvestment risk in our investment portfolio and monitor this risk in accordance with our assetliability management framework in addition we may reduce the crediting rates on our fixed products when warranted subject to guaranteed minimums in addition to the fixed rate exposures noted above riversource life has the following variable annuity guarantee benefits guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits gmwb guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits gmab guaranteed minimum death benefits gmdb and guaranteed minimum income benefits gmib each of these benefits guarantees payouts to the annuity holder under certain specific conditions regardless of the performance of the underlying invested assets the variable annuity guarantees continue to be managed by utilizing a hedging program which attempts to match the sensitivity of the assets with the sensitivity of the liabilities this approach works with the premise that matched sensitivities will produce a highly effective hedging result our comprehensive hedging program focuses mainly on first order sensitivities of assets and liabilities equity market level delta interest rate level rho and volatility vega additionally various second order sensitivities are managed we use various options swaptions swaps and futures to manage risk exposures the exposures are measured and monitored daily and adjustments to the hedge portfolio are made as necessary we have a macro hedge program to provide protection against the statutory tail scenario risk arising from variable annuity reserves on our statutory surplus and to cover some of the residual risks not covered by other hedging activities we assess the residual risk under a range of scenarios in creating and executing the macro hedge program as a means of economically hedging these risks we may use a combination of futures options swaps and swaptions certain of the macro hedge derivatives used contain settlement provisions linked to both equity returns and interest rates the remaining are interest rate contracts or equity contracts the macro hedge program could result in additional earnings volatility as changes in the value of the macro hedge derivatives which are designed to reduce statutory capital volatility may not be closely aligned to changes in the variable annuity guarantee embedded derivatives to evaluate interest rate and equity price risk we perform sensitivity testing which measures the impact on pretax income from the sources listed below for a 12month period following a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates or a hypothetical decline in equity prices the interest rate risk test assumes a sudden basis point parallel shift in the yield curve with rates then staying at those levels for the next months the equity price risk test assumes a sudden drop in equity prices with equity ameriprise financial inc prices then staying at those levels for the next months in estimating the values of variable annuities fixed deferred indexed annuities stock market certificates iul insurance and the associated hedge assets we assume no change in implied market volatility despite the drop in equity prices the following tables

modeled net of hedge impact the market impact of the macro hedge program is modeled net of any related impact to dac and dsic amortization represents the net impact to pretax income the estimated net impact to pretax adjusted operating income is approximately million ameriprise financial inc the above results compare to an estimated negative net impact to pretax income of million related to a equity price decline and an estimated positive net impact to pretax income of million related to a basis point increase in interest rates as of december the change in equity price exposure and interest rate exposure as of march compared to december was driven by a larger estimated negative impact from our variable annuity riders specifically gmwb net impacts shown in the above table from gmwb riders result largely from differences between the liability valuation basis and the hedging basis liabilities are valued using fair value accounting principles with risk margins incorporated in contractholder behavior assumptions and with discount rates increased to reflect a current market estimate of our risk of nonperformance specific to these liabilities our hedging is based on our determination of economic risk which excludes certain items in the liability valuation including the nonperformance spread risk actual results could differ materially from those illustrated above as they are based on a number of estimates and assumptions these include assuming that implied market volatility does not change when equity prices fall by and that the basis point increase in interest rates is a parallel shift of the yield curve furthermore we have not tried to anticipate changes in client preferences for different types of assets or other changes in client behavior nor have we tried to anticipate all strategic actions management might take to increase revenues or reduce expenses in these scenarios the selection of a basis point interest rate increase as well as a equity price decline should not be construed as a prediction of future market events impacts of larger or smaller changes in interest rates or equity prices may not be proportional to those shown for a basis point increase in interest rates or a decline in equity prices fair value measurements we report certain assets and liabilities at fair value specifically separate account assets derivatives embedded derivatives and most investments and cash equivalents fair value assumes the exchange of assets or liabilities occurs in orderly transactions and is not the result of a forced liquidation or distressed sale we include actual market prices or observable inputs in our fair value measurements to the extent available broker quotes are obtained when quotes from pricing services are not available we validate prices obtained from third parties through a variety of means such as price variance analysis subsequent sales testing stale price review price comparison across pricing vendors and due diligence reviews of vendors see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our fair value measurements fair value of liabilities and nonperformance risk companies are required to measure the fair value of liabilities at the price that would be received to transfer the liability to a market participant an exit price since there is not a market for our obligations of our variable annuity riders indexed annuities and iul insurance we consider the assumptions participants in a hypothetical market would make to reflect an exit price as a result we adjust the valuation of variable annuity riders indexed annuities and iul insurance by updating certain contractholder assumptions adding explicit margins to provide for profit risk and expenses and adjusting the rates used to discount expected cash flows to reflect a current market estimate of our nonperformance risk the nonperformance risk adjustment is based on observable market data adjusted to estimate the risk of our life insurance company subsidiaries not fulfilling these liabilities consistent with general market conditions this estimate resulted in a spread over the libor swap curve as of march as our estimate of this spread widens or tightens the liability will decrease or increase if this nonperformance credit spread moves to a zero spread over the libor swap curve the reduction to future net income would be approximately billion net of dac dsic unearned revenue amortization the reinsurance accrual and income taxes calculated at the statutory tax rate of based on

agreement to protect its exposure to genworth life insurance company glic for its reinsured ltc in substantial enhancements to this reinsurance protection agreement were finalized the terms of these confidential provisions within the agreement have been shared in the normal course of regular reviews with our domiciliary regulator and rating agencies glic is domiciled in delaware so in the event glic were subjected to rehabilitation or insolvency proceedings such proceedings would be located in and governed by delaware laws delaware courts have a long tradition of respecting commercial and reinsurance affairs as well as contracts among sophisticated parties similar credit protections to what we have with glic have been tested and respected in delaware and elsewhere in the united states and as a result we believe our credit protections would be respected even in the unlikely event that glic becomes subject to rehabilitation or insolvency proceedings in delaware accordingly while no credit protections are perfect we believe the correct way to think about the risks represented by our counterparty credit exposure to glic is not the full amount of the gross liability that glic reinsures but a much smaller net exposure to glic if any that might exist after taking into account our credit protections thus management believes that our agreement and offsetting non ltc legacy arrangements with genworth will enable riversource to recover on all net exposure in all material respects in the event of a rehabilitation or insolvency of glic dividends paid to shareholders and
