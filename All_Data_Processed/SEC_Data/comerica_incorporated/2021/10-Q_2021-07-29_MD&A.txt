discrete items capital continue share repurchases cet1 target of approximately percent strategic lines of business and markets the corporation has strategically aligned its operations into three major business segments the commercial bank the retail bank and wealth management these business segments are differentiated based on the type of customer and the related products and services provided in addition to the three major business segments the finance division is also reported as a segment the other category includes items not directly associated with the business segments or the finance segment the performance of the business segments is not comparable with the corporations consolidated results and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution additionally because of the interrelationships of the various segments the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities market segment results are also provided for the corporations three primary geographic markets michigan california and texas in addition to the three primary geographic markets other markets is also reported as a market segment note to the consolidated financial statements describes the business activities of each business segment and presents financial results of the business and market segments for the three and sixmonth periods ended june and the corporations management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each segment using certain methodologies which are regularly reviewed and refined these methodologies may be modified as the management accounting system is enhanced and changes occur in the organizational structure andor product lines note to the consolidated financial statements in the corporations annual report describes the corporations segment reporting methodology net interest income for each segment reflects the interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interestbearing liabilities plus the net impact from associated internal funds transfer pricing ftp the ftp methodology allocates credits to each business segment for deposits and other funds provided as well as charges for loans and other assets being funded ftp crediting rates on deposits and other funds provided reflect the longterm value of deposits and other funding sources based on their implied maturities due to the longerterm nature of implied maturities ftp crediting rates are generally less volatile than changes in interest rates observed in the market ftp charge rates for funding loans and other assets reflect a matched cost of funds based on the pricing and duration characteristics of the assets as a result of applying matched funding interest revenue for each segment resulting from loans and other assets is generally not impacted by changes in interest rates therefore net interest income for each segment primarily reflects the volume of loans and other earning assets at the spread over the matched cost of funds as well as the volume of deposits at the associated ftp crediting rates due to the impact of lower interest rates business segments particularly those focused on generating deposits were impacted by lower ftp crediting rates on deposits in the six months ended june compared to the same period in the prior year similarly ftp charges for funding loans decreased in the six months ended june compared to the same period in the prior year business segments the following sections present a summary

earnings generation capital needs to fund future loan growth and market conditions the corporation continues to target a common equity tier capital ratio of approximately percent with continued active capital management at june the corporations estimated cet1 capital ratio was percent in the corporation elected regulatory relief to defer the impact of adopting the cecl model for measuring credit

should be read in conjunction with the risk management section on pages f22 through f38 in the corporations annual report credit risk allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments as a percentage of total loans the allowance for credit losses was percent at june compared to percent at december excluding billion in ppp loans which are guaranteed by the small business administration the allowance for credit losses was percent of total loans at june compared to percent at december the allowance for credit losses covered times and times total nonperforming loans at june and december respectively the allowance for credit losses decreased million to million at june primarily reflecting a sustained recovery by the us economy from the covid19 pandemic and benefits of mitigating actions by the us government in addition to trillion of stimulus spending approved by congress between december and march the positive progress of the vaccine rollout and associated opening of the broader economy contributed to an improved economic outlook despite these favorable developments there continues to be uncertainty related to emerging covid19 variants supply chain and labor constraints future monetary and fiscal actions and inflationary pressures these factors shaped the 2year reasonable and supportable forecasts used by the corporation in its cecl estimate at june the us economy is expected to continue to grow at an accelerated pace through before normalizing into historical growth rates in f orecasts for other key economic variables including the unemployment rate and oil prices are generally in line with gdp projections interest rates remain low reflecting the federal reserves expectati on that rates will remain at current levels in the nearto midterm while corporate bond rates reflect normalizing default risk the following table summarizes select economic variables representative of the economic forecasts used to develop the allowance for credit losses estimate at june economic variable base forecast real gross domestic product gdp growth growth decreases to percent by fourth quarter normalizing into a longterm growth rate of between to percent by the beginning of unemployment rate current levels gradually decrease to below percent by third quarter corporate bbb bond to 10year treasury bond spreads spreads gradually increase from current levels to percent by the end of the forecast period oil prices prices stable at around per barrel throughout the forecast period due to the high level of uncertainty regarding significant assumptions such as the ultimate impact of the global pandemic the corporation evaluated a range of economic scenarios including more benign and more severe economic forecasts in the more severe scenario real gdp is expected to contract through first quarter gradually improving to percent by the end of the forecast period other key economic variables follow a similar pattern of a lagged recovery selecting the more severe forecast would result in an increase in the quantitative calculation of allowance for credit losses by approximately million as of june however factoring in model overlays and qualitative adjustments could result in a materially different estimate under a more severe scenario allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents managements estimates of current expected credit losses in the corporations loan portfolio pools of loans with similar risk characteristics are collectively evaluated while loans that no longer share risk characteristics with loan pools are evaluated individually collective loss estimates are determined by applying reserve factors designed to estimate current expected credit losses to amortized cost balances over the remaining contractual life of the collectively evaluated portfolio

believes is appropriate based on factors that have not otherwise been fully accounted for including adjustments for foresight risk input imprecisions and model imprecision credit losses for loans that no longer share risk characteristics with the loan pools are estimated on an individual basis individual credit loss estimates are typically performed for nonaccrual loans and modified loans

liquidity risk management strategies and consists of executive and senior management from various areas of the corporation including treasury finance economics lending deposit gathering and risk management corporate treasury mitigates market and liquidity risk under the direction of alco through the actions it takes to manage the corporations market liquidity and capital positions in addition to assessing liquidity risk on a consolidated basis corporate treasury also monitors the parent companys liquidity and has established limits for the minimum number of months into the future in which the parent company can meet existing and forecasted obligations without the support of additional dividends from subsidiaries alcos liquidity policy requires the parent company to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet expected capital and debt obligations with a target of months but no less than months corporate treasury and the enterprise risk division support alco in measuring monitoring and managing interest rate risk as well as all other market risks key activities encompass i providing information and analyses of the corporations balance sheet structure and measurement of interest rate and all other market risks ii monitoring and reporting of the corporations positions relative to established policy limits and guidelines iii developing and presenting analyses and strategies to adjust risk positions iv reviewing and presenting policies and authorizations for approval and v monitoring of industry trends and analytical tools to be used in the management of interest rate and all other market and liquidity risks interest rate risk net interest income is the primary source of revenue for the corporation interest rate risk arises in the normal course of business due to differences in the repricing and cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities primarily through the corporations core business activities of extending loans and acquiring deposits the corporations balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floatingrate loans funded by core deposits including the impact of interest rate swaps converting floatingrate loans to fixed the corporations loan composition at june was percent 30day libor percent other libor primarily 60and 90day percent prime and percent fixed rate additionally percent of loans had nonzero interest rate floors protecting against future rate declines the composition of the loan portfolio creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to the imbalance between the faster repricing of the floatingrate loan portfolio versus deposit products in addition the growth andor contraction in the corporations loans and deposits may lead to changes in sensitivity to interest rate movements in the absence of mitigating actions examples of such actions are purchasing fixedrate investment securities which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest sensitivity as well as hedging with interest rate swaps and options other mitigating factors include interest rate floors on a portion of the loan portfolio the corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity since no single measurement system satisfies all management objectives a combination of techniques is used to manage interest rate risk these techniques examine the impact of interest rate risk on net interest income and the economic value of equity under a variety of alternative scenarios including changes in the level slope and shape of the yield curve utilizing multiple simulation analyses simulation analyses produce only estimates of net interest income as the assumptions used are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from simulated results due to many factors including but not limited to the timing magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates market conditions regulatory impacts and management strategies sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates the analysis of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios is managements principal risk management technique management models a basecase net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment existing derivative instruments entered into for risk management purposes as of the balance sheet dates are included in the analysis but no additional hedging is forecasted at june these derivative instruments comprise interest rate swaps that convert billion of fixedrate medium and longterm debt to variable rates through fair value hedges and convert billion of variablerate loans to fixed rates through cash flow hedges additionally included in this analysis are billion of loans that were subject to an average interest rate floor of percent at june this basecase net interest income is then compared against interest rate scenarios in which shortterm rates rise or decline basis points with a floor of zero percent in a linear nonparallel fashion from the base case over months resulting in an average change of basis points over the period while longterm rates increase or decrease to a lesser degree each scenario includes assumptions such as loan growth investment security prepayment levels depositor behavior yield curve changes loan and deposit pricing and overall balance sheet mix and growth which are in line with historical patterns however in this low rate environment depositors have maintained a higher level of liquidity and their historical behavior may be less indicative of future trends as a result the rising rate scenario reflects a greater decrease in deposits than we have experienced historically as rates rise changes in actual economic activity may result in a materially different interest rate environment as well as a balance sheet structure that is different from the changes management included in its simulation analysis the table below as of june and december displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next months by relating the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above estimated annual change june december dollar amounts in millions amount amount change in interest rates change in interest rates rising basis points rising basis points declining to zero percent declining to zero percent sensitivity to declining interest rates remained steady from december to june due to increased securities portfolio balances and growth of loan floors partially offset by higher nonmaturity deposit balances as well as limited remaining downward movement in rates before hitting zero percent floors sensitivity to rising interest rates increased slightly due to growth of nonmaturity deposits partially offset by an increase in investment securities sensitivity of economic value of equity to changes in interest rates in addition to the simulation analysis on net interest income an economic value of equity analysis provides an alternative view of the interest rate risk position the economic value of equity is the difference between the estimate of the economic value of the corporations financial assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period and the estimated economic value after applying the estimated impact of rate movements the corporation primarily monitors the percentage change on the basecase economic value of equity the economic value of equity analysis is based on an immediate parallel basis point shock with a floor of zero percent the table below as of june and december displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from the interest rate scenario described above june december dollar amounts in millions amount amount change in interest rates change in interest rates rising basis points rising basis points declining to zero percent declining to zero percent the sensitivity of the economic value of equity to rising rates decreased from december to june due primarily to duration extension and balance growth in the securities portfolio sensitivity to declining rates decreased due to changes in the securities portfolio and is limited by the assumption of a zero percent rate floor libor transition on july the united kingdoms financial conduct authority fca which regulates libor publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after
