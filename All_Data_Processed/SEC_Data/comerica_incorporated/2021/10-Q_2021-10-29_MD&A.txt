noninterest expenses and lower fdic insurance expense the increase in salaries and benefits expense reflected higher performancerelated compensation driven by strong financial results higher technologyrelated labor costs related to contract labor and staff insurance from elevated claims also contributed to the increase in salaries and benefits expense the increase in outside processing fee expense was primarily due to higher volumes of government card transactions tied to card fee revenue and data processing support for ppp loans the decrease in other noninterest expenses was driven by lower nonsalary pension expense and operational losses partially offset by higher litigationrelated expenses and consulting fees provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes increased

excluding discrete items capital cet1 target of approximately percent strategic lines of business and markets the corporation has strategically aligned its operations into three major business segments the commercial bank the retail bank and wealth management these business segments are differentiated based on the type of customer and the related products and services provided in addition to the three major business segments the finance division is also reported as a segment the other category includes items not directly associated with the business segments or the finance segment the performance of the business segments is not comparable with the corporations consolidated results and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution additionally because of the interrelationships of the various segments the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities market segment results are also provided for the corporations three primary geographic markets michigan california and texas in addition to the three primary geographic markets other markets is also reported as a market segment note to the consolidated financial statements describes the business activities of each business segment and presents financial results of the business and market segments for the three and ninemonth periods ended september and the corporations management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each segment using certain methodologies which are regularly reviewed and refined these methodologies may be modified as the management accounting system is enhanced and changes occur in the organizational structure andor product lines note to the consolidated financial statements in the corporations annual report describes the corporations segment reporting methodology net interest income for each segment reflects the interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interestbearing liabilities plus the net impact from associated internal funds transfer pricing ftp the ftp methodology allocates credits to each business segment for deposits and other funds provided as well as charges for loans and other assets being funded ftp crediting rates on deposits and other funds provided reflect the longterm value of deposits and other funding sources based on their implied maturities due to the longerterm nature of implied maturities ftp crediting rates are generally less volatile than changes in interest rates observed in the market ftp charge rates for funding loans and other assets reflect a matched cost of funds based on the pricing and duration characteristics of the assets as a result of applying matched funding interest revenue for each segment resulting from loans and other assets is generally not impacted by changes in interest rates therefore net interest income for each segment primarily reflects the volume of loans and other earning assets at the spread over the matched cost of funds as well as the volume of deposits at the associated ftp crediting rates due to the impact of lower interest rates business segments particularly those focused on generating deposits were impacted by lower ftp crediting rates on deposits in the nine months ended september compared to the same period in the prior year similarly ftp charges for funding loans decreased in the nine months ended september compared to the same period in the prior year business segments the following sections present a summary

supplemental financial data section for reconciliations of nongaap financial measures and regulatory ratios risk management the following updated information should be read in conjunction with the risk management section on pages f22 through f38 in the corporations annual report credit risk allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments as a percentage of total loans the allowance for credit losses was percent at september compared to percent at december excluding billion in ppp loans which are guaranteed by the small business administration the allowance for credit losses was percent of total loans at september compared to percent at december the allowance for credit losses covered times and times total nonperforming loans at september and december respectively the allowance for credit losses decreased million from million at december to million at september primarily reflecting a sustained recovery by the us economy from the covid19 pandemic and benefits of mitigating actions by the us government despite a slowdown in consumer spending driven by the delta variant strong business spending and improved labor markets supported growth in the broader us economy however there continues to be uncertainty related to the impact of emerging covid19 variants and lagging vaccination rates supply chain constraints future monetary and fiscal support and inflationary pressures these factors shaped the 2year reasonable and supportable forecasts used by the corporation in its cecl estimate at september the us economy is expected to continue to grow at an accelerated pace through the first half of before normalizing into historical growth rates forecasts for other key economic variables including the unemployment rate and oil prices are generally in line with gdp projections interest rates remain low reflecting the federal reserves expectation that rates will remain at current levels in the nearto midterm while corporate bond rates reflect normalized default risk the following table summarizes select economic variables representative of the economic forecasts used to develop the allowance for credit losses estimate at september economic variable base forecast real gross domestic product gdp growth growth peaks at percent in fourth quarter before gradually declining to a longterm rate of to percent by third quarter unemployment rate current levels decrease to percent by third quarter with minimal change through the remainder of the forecast period corporate bbb bond to 10year treasury bond spreads spreads gradually increase to percent by the end of the forecast period oil prices prices gradually decrease from current levels to per barrel by the end of the forecast period due to the high level of uncertainty regarding significant assumptions such as the ultimate impact of the global pandemic the corporation evaluated a range of economic scenarios including more benign and more severe economic forecasts in the more severe scenario real gdp is expected to contract through second quarter gradually improving to a growth rate of percent by the end of the forecast period other key economic variables follow a similar pattern of shortterm contractions followed by a gradual recovery selecting the more severe forecast would result in an increase in the quantitative calculation of allowance for credit losses by approximately million as of september however factoring in model overlays and qualitative adjustments could result in a materially different estimate under a more severe scenario allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents managements estimates of current expected credit losses in the corporations loan portfolio pools of loans with similar risk characteristics are collectively evaluated while loans that no longer share risk characteristics with loan pools are evaluated individually collective loss estimates are determined by applying reserve factors designed to estimate current expected credit losses to amortized cost balances over the remaining contractual life of the collectively evaluated portfolio loans with similar risk characteristics are aggregated into homogeneous pools the allowance for loan losses also includes qualitative adjustments to bring the allowance to the level management believes is appropriate based on factors that have not otherwise been fully accounted for including adjustments for foresight risk input imprecisions and model imprecision credit losses for loans that no longer share risk characteristics with the loan pools are estimated on an individual basis individual credit loss estimates are typically performed for nonaccrual loans and modified loans classified as troubled debt restructurings tdrs and are based on one of several methods including the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral observable market value of similar debt or the present value of expected cash flows the following table presents metrics of the allowance for loan losses and nonperforming loans september december allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans excluding ppp loans nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans allowance for loan losses as a multiple of total nonperforming loans allowance for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments the allowance for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments estimates current expected credit losses on collective pools of letters of credit and unused commitments to extend credit based on reserve factors determined in a manner similar to business loans multiplied by a probability of draw estimate based on historical experience and credit risk applied to commitment amounts the allowance for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments totaled million and million at september and december respectively for additional information regarding the allowance for credit losses refer to the critical accounting policies section

strategies and consists of executive and senior management from various areas of the corporation including treasury finance economics lending deposit gathering and risk management corporate treasury mitigates market and liquidity risk under the direction of alco through the actions it takes to manage the corporations market liquidity and capital positions in addition to assessing liquidity risk on a consolidated basis corporate treasury also monitors the parent companys liquidity and has established limits for the minimum number of months into the future in which the parent company can meet existing and forecasted obligations without the support of additional dividends from subsidiaries alcos liquidity policy requires the parent company to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet expected capital and debt obligations with a target of months but no less than months corporate treasury and the enterprise risk division support alco in measuring monitoring and managing interest rate risk as well as all other market risks key activities encompass i providing information and analyses of the corporations balance sheet structure and measurement of interest rate and all other market risks ii monitoring and reporting of the corporations positions relative to established policy limits and guidelines iii developing and presenting analyses and strategies to adjust risk positions iv reviewing and presenting policies and authorizations for approval and v monitoring of industry trends and analytical tools to be used in the management of interest rate and all other market and liquidity risks interest rate risk net interest income is the primary source of revenue for the corporation interest rate risk arises in the normal course of business due to differences in the repricing and cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities primarily through the corporations core business activities of extending loans and acquiring deposits the corporations balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floatingrate loans funded by core deposits including the impact of interest rate swaps converting floatingrate loans to fixed the corporations loan composition at september was percent 30day libor percent other libor primarily 60and 90day percent prime and percent fixed rate additionally percent of loans had nonzero interest rate floors protecting against future rate declines the composition of the loan portfolio creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to the imbalance between the faster repricing of the floatingrate loan portfolio versus deposit products in addition the growth andor contraction in the corporations loans and deposits may lead to changes in sensitivity to interest rate movements in the absence of mitigating actions examples of such actions are purchasing fixedrate investment securities which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest sensitivity as well as hedging with interest rate swaps and options other mitigating factors include interest rate floors on a portion of the loan portfolio the corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity since no single measurement system satisfies all management objectives a combination of techniques is used to manage interest rate risk these techniques examine the impact of interest rate risk on net interest income and the economic value of equity under a variety of alternative scenarios including changes in the level slope and shape of the yield curve utilizing multiple simulation analyses simulation analyses produce only estimates of net interest income as the assumptions used are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from simulated results due to many factors including but not limited to the timing magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates market conditions regulatory impacts and management strategies sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates the analysis of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios is managements principal risk management technique management models a basecase net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment existing derivative instruments entered into for risk management purposes as of the balance sheet dates are included in the analysis but no additional hedging is forecasted at september these derivative instruments comprise interest rate swaps that convert billion of fixedrate medium and longterm debt to variable rates through fair value hedges and convert billion of variablerate loans to fixed rates through cash flow hedges additionally included in this analysis are billion of loans that were subject to an average interest rate floor of percent at september this basecase net interest income is then compared against interest rate scenarios in which shortterm rates rise or decline basis points with a floor of zero percent in a linear nonparallel fashion from the base case over months resulting in an average change of basis points over the period while longterm rates increase or decrease to a lesser degree each scenario includes assumptions such as loan growth investment security prepayment levels depositor behavior yield curve changes loan and deposit pricing and overall balance sheet mix and growth which are in line with historical patterns however in this low rate environment depositors have maintained a higher level of liquidity and their historical behavior may be less indicative of future trends as a result the rising rate scenario reflects a greater decrease in deposits than we have experienced historically as rates rise changes in actual economic activity may result in a materially different interest rate environment as well as a balance sheet structure that is different from the changes management included in its simulation analysis the table below as of september and december displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next months by relating the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above estimated annual change september december dollar amounts in millions amount amount change in interest rates change in interest rates rising basis points rising basis points declining to zero percent declining to zero percent sensitivity to declining interest rates remained steady from december to september due to offsetting changes in balance sheet composition as well as limited remaining downward movement in rates before hitting zero percent floors sensitivity to rising interest rates slightly increased due to forgiveness of fixedrate ppp loans and higher deposit volumes partially offset by the growth of floatingrate loans with floors as well as a larger securities portfolio sensitivity of economic value of equity to changes in interest rates in addition to the simulation analysis on net interest income an economic value of equity analysis provides an alternative view of the interest rate risk position the economic value of equity is the difference between the estimate of the economic value of the corporations financial assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period and the estimated economic value after applying the estimated impact of rate movements the corporation primarily monitors the percentage change on the basecase economic value of equity the economic value of equity analysis is based on an immediate parallel basis point shock with a floor of zero percent the table below as of september and december displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from the interest rate scenario described above september december dollar amounts in millions amount amount change in interest rates change in interest rates rising basis points rising basis points declining to zero percent declining to zero percent the sensitivity of the economic value of equity to rising rates decreased from december to september due primarily to duration extension and balance growth in the securities portfolio sensitivity to declining rates decreased due to the changes in the securities portfolio and is limited by the assumption of a zero percent rate floor libor transition on july the united kingdoms financial conduct authority fca which regulates libor publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after effective march the fca confirmed that certain libor tenors will no longer be supported after december and that the remaining tenors including those most commonly used by the

the most significant of which are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in the corporations annual report these policies require numerous estimates and strategic or

condition and results of operations at december the most critical of these significant accounting policies were the policies related to the allowance for credit losses fair value measurement goodwill pension plan accounting and income taxes these policies were reviewed with the audit committee of the corporations board of directors and are discussed more fully on pages f39 through f43 in the corporations annual report as of the date of this report there have been no significant changes to the corporations critical accounting policies or estimates except for the mrva methodology change described in results of operations and note to the consolidated financial statements and the updates to the goodwill critical accounting policy outlined below the corporation performed the annual goodwill impairment test in third quarter resulting in the following updates to the critical accounting policy on page f41 of the corporations annual report goodwill goodwill is initially recorded as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level equivalent to a business segment or one level below the corporation has three reporting units the commercial bank the retail bank and wealth management at september and december goodwill totaled million including million allocated to the commercial bank million allocated to the retail bank and million allocated to wealth management the annual test of goodwill impairment was performed as of the beginning of the third quarter the corporation first assessed qualitative factors to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was less than its carrying amount including goodwill qualitative factors included economic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors overall financial performance regulatory developments and performance of the corporations stock among other events and circumstances at the conclusion of the qualitative assessment in third quarter the corporation determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value qualitative factors considered in the analysis of each reporting unit incorporate current macroeconomic and market conditions such as trends in key economic data and industry developments effects of the global pandemic and ongoing recovery to the business recent reporting unit financial performance and the impact of regulatory and legislative actions further weakening in the economic environment such as a decline in the performance of the reporting units or other factors could cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below their carrying value resulting in a goodwill impairment charge additionally new legislative or regulatory changes not anticipated in managements expectations may cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below the carrying value resulting in a goodwill impairment charge any impairment charge would not affect the corporations regulatory capital ratios tangible equity ratio or liquidity position supplemental financial data the corporation believes nongaap measures are meaningful because they reflect
