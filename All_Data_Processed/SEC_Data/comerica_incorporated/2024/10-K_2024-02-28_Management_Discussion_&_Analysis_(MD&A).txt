strategically aligned its operations into three major business segments the commercial bank the retail bank and wealth management these business segments are differentiated based on the type of customer and the related products and services provided in addition to the three major business segments the finance division is also reported as a segment the other category includes items not directly associated with the business segments or the finance segment the performance of the business segments is not comparable with the corporations consolidated results and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution additionally because of the interrelationships of the various segments the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities note to the consolidated financial statements describes the corporations segment reporting methodology as well as the business activities of each business segment and presents financial results of the business segments for the years ended december and the corporations management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each segment using certain methodologies which are regularly reviewed and refined these methodologies may be modified as the management accounting system is enhanced and changes occur in the organizational structure andor product lines net interest income for each segment reflects the interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interestbearing liabilities plus the net impact from associated internal funds transfer pricing ftp funding credits and charges the ftp methodology allocates credits to each business segment for deposits and other funds provided as well as charges for loans and other assets being funded ftp crediting rates on deposits and other funds provided reflect the longterm value of deposits and other funding sources based on their implied maturities due to the longerterm nature of implied maturities ftp crediting rates are generally less volatile than changes in interest rates observed in the market ftp charge rates for funding loans and other assets reflect a matched cost of funds based on the pricing and duration characteristics of the assets as a result of applying matched funding interest revenue for each segment resulting from loans and other assets is generally not impacted by changes in interest rates therefore net interest income for each segment primarily reflects the volume of loans and other earning assets at the spread over the matched cost of funds as well as the volume of deposits at the associated ftp crediting rates generally in periods of rising interest rates ftp charge rates for funding loans and ftp crediting rates on deposits will increase with ftp crediting rates for deposits typically repricing at a slower pace than ftp charge rates for funding loans the following

standardized approach rwa is generally based on supervisory risk weightings which vary by counterparty type and asset class under the basel iii standardized approach capital is required for credit risk rwa to cover the risk of unexpected losses due to failure of a customer or counterparty to meet its financial obligations in accordance with contractual terms and if trading assets and

capital to adjusted average assets leverage ratio a in addition to the minimum riskbased capital requirements the corporation is required to maintain a minimum capital conservation buffer in the form

the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of regulatory capital requirements capital ratio calculations and restrictions on the ability of the corporations banking subsidiaries to transfer assets to the corporation the common shareholders equity ratio increased basis points to percent at december primarily due to lower unrealized losses on investment securities availableforsale

referred to as basel iii endgame the capital proposal that would significantly increase the capital requirements applicable to large banking organizations with total assets of billion or more the capital proposal would align the regulatory capital calculation and the calculation of riskweighted assets across large banking organizations subject to the capital proposal and require category iii and iv banking organizations to include most components of aoci including net unrealized gains and losses on availableforsale securities in their regulatory capital ratios the capital proposal is subject to a public comment period which ended on january and if adopted would include a threeyear transition period beginning july as of december the corporation had total assets of billion while the capital proposal would not apply to the corporation as it is currently proposed if the corporation becomes subject to the requirements of the capital proposal in the future or becomes subject to any other new laws or regulations related to capital and liquidity such requirements could limit the corporations ability to pay dividends or make share repurchases or require comerica to reduce business levels or to raise capital which would have a material adverse effect on the corporations financial condition and results of operations if subject to the capital proposal the estimated impact related to proposed inclusion of most components of aoci would be an approximate basis point decrease to common equity tier1 capital based on december financials f17 table of contents risk management the

customer or counterparty to meet its financial obligations in accordance with contractual terms credit risk is found in all activities where success depends on counterparty issuer or borrower performance it arises any time funds are extended committed invested or otherwise exposed whether reflected on or off the balance sheet the governance structure is administered through the strategic credit committee the strategic credit committee is chaired by the chief credit officer and approves recommendations to address credit risk matters through credit policy credit risk management practices and required credit risk actions the strategic credit committee also ensures a comprehensive reporting of credit risk levels and trends including exception levels along with identification and mitigation of emerging risks in order to facilitate the corporate credit risk management process various other corporate functions provide the resources for the strategic credit committee to carry out its responsibilities the corporation manages credit risk through underwriting and periodically reviewing and approving its credit exposures in accordance with established credit policies and guidelines additionally the corporation manages credit risk through loan portfolio diversification limiting exposure to any single industry customer or guarantor and selling participations andor

liquidity risk represents the risk that the corporation does not have sufficient access to funds to maintain its normal operations at all times or does not have the ability to raise or borrow funds at a reasonable cost at all times the asset liability management committee alco of the corporation establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market and liquidity risk management activities alco meets regularly to discuss and review market and liquidity risk management strategies and consists of executive and senior management from various areas of the corporation including treasury finance economics lending deposit gathering and risk management corporate treasury mitigates market and liquidity risk under the direction of alco through the actions it takes to manage the corporations market liquidity and capital positions the corporation performs monthly liquidity stress testing to evaluate its ability to meet funding needs in hypothetical stressed environments such environments cover a series of scenarios including both idiosyncratic and marketwide in nature which vary in terms of duration and severity recent events have created greater uncertainty with respect to normal deposit patterns following the march banking industry disruption the corporation activated its contingency funding plan by increasing its cash position through wholesale funding channels and brokered deposits the corporations evaluation as of december projected that sufficient sources of liquidity were available under each series of events in addition to assessing liquidity risk on a consolidated basis corporate treasury also monitors the parent companys liquidity and has established liquidity coverage requirements for meeting expected obligations without the support of additional dividends from subsidiaries alcos policy on liquidity risk management requires the parent company to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet expected cash obligations such as debt service dividend payments and normal operating expenses over a period of no less than months the corporation had liquid assets of billion on an unconsolidated basis at december corporate treasury and the enterprise risk division support alco in measuring monitoring and managing interest rate risk as well as all other market risks key activities encompass i providing information and analyses of the corporations balance sheet structure and measurement of interest rate and all other market risks ii monitoring and reporting of the corporations positions relative to established policy limits and guidelines iii developing and presenting analyses and strategies to adjust risk positions iv reviewing and presenting policies and authorizations for approval and v monitoring of industry trends and analytical tools to be used in the management of interest rate and all other market and liquidity risks interest rate risk net interest income is the primary source of revenue for the corporation interest rate risk arises in the normal course of business due to differences in the repricing and cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities primarily through the corporations core business activities of extending loans and acquiring deposits the corporations balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floatingrate loans funded by core deposits including the impact of interest rate swaps converting floatingrate loans to fixed the corporations loan composition at december was percent fixedrate percent overnight to 30day rate percent 90day and greater rates and percent prime the composition of the loan portfolio creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to the imbalance between the faster repricing of the floatingrate loan portfolio versus deposit products in addition the growth andor contraction in the corporations loans and deposits may lead to changes in sensitivity to interest rate movements in the absence of mitigating actions examples of such actions are purchasing fixedrate investment securities which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest rate sensitivity as well as hedging with interest rate swaps and options other mitigating factors include interest rate floors on a portion of the loan portfolio the corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity since no single measurement system satisfies all management objectives a combination of techniques is used to manage interest rate risk these techniques examine the impact of interest rate risk on net interest income and the economic value of equity under a variety of alternative scenarios including changes in the level slope and shape of the yield curve utilizing multiple simulation analyses simulation analyses produce only estimates of net interest income as the assumptions used are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from simulated results due to many factors including but not limited to the timing magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates market conditions regulatory impacts and management strategies f27 table of contents sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates the analysis of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios is managements principal risk management technique management models a basecase net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment using a static balance sheet and generates sensitivity scenarios by changing certain model assumptions each scenario includes assumptions such as loan growth investment security prepayment levels depositor behavior and overall balance sheet mix and growth which are in line with historical patterns additionally the analysis assumes that all loan hedges qualify for hedge accounting changes in actual economic activity may result in a materially different interest rate environment as well as a balance sheet structure that is different from the changes management included in its simulation analysis model assumptions in the sensitivity scenarios at december included for the rising rate scenarios a modest increase in loan balances and a moderate decrease in deposit balances and for the declining rate scenarios a modest decrease in loan balances and a moderate increase in deposit balances in addition both scenarios assumed loan spreads held at current levels an incremental interestbearing deposit beta of approximately deposit mix shifts based on historical observations partial reinvestment of securities portfolio cash flows and no additions to interest rate swaps the average balance of the securities portfolio included in the analysis was billion for

sensitivity to rising interest rates increased compared to december resulting from the change in liability mix that occurred in f28 table of contents at december additional sensitivity scenarios applied the rising and declining basis point scenario assumptions with a incremental deposit beta relative to the base case scenario to assess the impact of the corporations deposit beta assumptions in these rising and declining scenarios net interest income decreased by million and increased by million respectively due to a more rapid repricing pace compared to the standard model assumptions all scenarios presented for december reflected a change in balance sheet composition following the march banking industry disruption as the balance sheet maintained a higher concentration of cash as well as increased wholesale funding and brokered deposits which contributed to the decrease in net interest income in all scenarios presented sensitivity of economic value of equity to changes in interest rates in addition to the simulation analysis on net interest income an economic value of equity analysis provides an alternative view of the interest rate risk position the economic value of equity is the difference between the estimate of the economic value of the corporations financial assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period and the estimated economic value after applying the estimated impact of rate movements the corporation primarily monitors the percentage change on the basecase economic value of equity the economic value of equity analysis is based on an immediate parallel or basis point shock with a floor of zero percent the table below as of december and december displays the estimated

represent the future cash requirements of the corporation refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of these commercial commitments other market risks market risk related to the corporations trading instruments is not significant as trading activities are limited certain components of the corporations noninterest income primarily fiduciary income are at risk to fluctuations in the market values of underlying assets particularly equity and debt securities other components of noninterest income primarily brokerage fees are at risk to changes in the volume of market activity f33 table of contents operational risk operational risk represents the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes and people or from external events excluding in most cases those driven by technology see technology risk below the corporations definition of operational risk includes fraud employment practice and workplace safety clients products and business practice business continuity or disaster recovery execution delivery and process management third party and model risks the definition does not include strategic or reputational risks although operational losses are experienced by all companies and are routinely incurred in business operations the corporation recognizes the need to identify and control operational losses and seeks to limit losses to a level deemed appropriate by management as outlined in the corporations risk appetite statement the appropriate risk level is determined through consideration of the nature of the corporations business and the environment in which it operates in combination with the impact from and the possible impact on other risks faced by the corporation operational risk is mitigated through a system of internal controls that are designed to keep operating risks at appropriate levels the operational risk management committee monitors risk management techniques and systems the corporation has developed a framework that includes a centralized operational risk reporting function in the enterprise risk division and businesssupport unit risk liaisons responsible for managing operational risk specific to the respective business lines technology risk technology risk represents the risk of loss or adverse outcomes arising from the people processes applications and infrastructure that support the technology environment the corporations definition of technology risk includes technology delivery risk technology investment risk cybersecurity risk information security risk and information management risk technology risk is inclusive of the risks associated with the execution of technology processes and activities by thirdparty contractors and suppliers to the corporation other risk types may materialize in the event of a technology risk event such as the risk of a financial reporting error or regulatory noncompliance and the impact of such risks are highly interdependent with operational risk the technology risk committee comprising senior and executive business unit managers as well as managers responsible for technology cybersecurity information security and enterprise risk management oversees technology risk the technology risk committee also ensures that appropriate actions are implemented in business units to mitigate risk to an acceptable level compliance risk compliance risk represents the risk of sanctions or financial loss resulting from the corporations failure to comply with all applicable laws regulations and standards of good banking practice the impact of such risks is highly interdependent with strategic risk as the reputational impact from compliance breaches can be severe activities which may expose the corporation to compliance risk include but are not limited to those dealing with the prevention of money laundering privacy and data protection community reinvestment initiatives fair lending consumer protection employment and tax matters overthecounter derivative activities and other regulated activities the enterprisewide compliance committee comprising senior and executive business unit managers as well as managers responsible for compliance audit and overall risk oversees compliance risk this enterprisewide approach provides a consistent view of compliance across the organization the enterprisewide compliance committee also ensures that appropriate actions are implemented in business units to mitigate risk to an acceptable level strategic risk strategic risk represents the risk of inadequate returns or possible losses due to impairment of reputation failure to fully develop and execute business plans failure to assess current and new opportunities in business markets and products failure to determine appropriate consideration for risks accepted and any other event not identified in the defined risk categories of credit market and liquidity operational technology or compliance risks mitigation of the various risk elements that represent strategic risk is achieved through numerous metrics and initiatives to help the corporation better understand measure and report on such risks f34 table of contents critical accounting estimates the corporations consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies the most significant of which are described in note these policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions which may prove inaccurate or subject to variations changes in underlying factors assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the corporations future financial condition and results of operations at december the most critical of these estimates related to the allowance for credit losses fair value measurement goodwill pension plan accounting and income taxes these estimates were reviewed with the audit committee of the corporations board of directors and are discussed more fully below allowance for credit losses in accordance with cecl the allowance for credit losses which includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments is calculated with the objective of maintaining a reserve for current expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life of the portfolio the corporation uses loss factors based on estimated probability of default for internal risk ratings and loss given default to determine the allowance for credit losses for the majority of its portfolio management applies loss factors to pools of loans and lendingrelated commitments with similar risk characteristics calibrates these factors using economic forecasts and incorporates qualitative adjustments for further discussion of the methodology used in the determination of the allowance for credit losses refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the economic forecast incorporated into the model refer to the risk management section of this financial review managements determination of the appropriateness of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio lendingrelated commitments current as well as forecasted economic factors and other relevant information the calculation is inherently subjective and requires management to exercise significant judgment in developing assumptions for the estimate the most significant of which are the loan risk rating process development of economic forecasts and application of qualitative adjustments sensitivities are disclosed to demonstrate how changes in loan risk ratings and economic forecast scenarios may impact the allowance for credit losses sensitivities only consider changes to each specific assumption in isolation and their impact to the quantitative modeled results they do not contemplate impacts to the qualitative framework loan risk rating process reserve factors are applied to pools of loans based on risk characteristics including the corporations internal risk rating system therefore loss estimates are highly dependent on the accuracy of the risk rating assigned to each loan the inherent imprecision in the risk rating system resulting from inaccuracy in assigning andor entering risk ratings in the loan accounting system is monitored by the corporations asset quality review function changes to internal risk ratings beyond the forecasted migration inherent in the credit models would result in a different estimated allowance for credit losses to illustrate if percent of the individual risk ratings were adjusted down by one rating across all pools the allowance for loan losses as of december would change by approximately million forecasted economic variables management utilizes models through which historical reserve factor estimates are calibrated to economic forecasts over the reasonable and supportable forecast period based on the projected performance of specific economic variables that statistically correlate with the probability of default and loss given default pools loss estimates revert to historical loss experience for contractual lives beyond the forecast period management selects economic variables it believes to be most relevant based on the composition of the loan portfolio and customer base including forecasted levels of employment gross domestic product corporate bond and treasury spreads industrial production levels consumer and commercial real estate price indices as well as housing statistics the allowance for credit losses is highly sensitive to the economic forecasts used to develop the estimate due to the high level of uncertainty regarding significant assumptions the corporation evaluated a range of economic scenarios including a more severe economic forecast scenario with varying responses to current economic risks the following table summarizes the more severe forecast scenario for the economic variables that are most impactful f35 table of contents economic variable real gdp growth unemployment rate corporate bbb bond to 10year treasury bond spreads oil prices more severe forecast contracts through third quarter peaking at a decline of percent annualized in second quarter subsequently improving to a percent annual growth rate by the end of the forecast period increases to percent by first quarter followed by a gradual decline to percent by the end of the forecast period spreads widen to a peak of over percent before gradually narrowing to percent by the end of the forecast period decline to per barrel by first quarter before increasing to per barrel by the end of the forecast period selecting a different forecast in the current environment could result in a significantly different estimated allowance for credit losses to illustrate absent model overlays and other qualitative adjustments that are part of the quarterly reserving process if the corporation selected the more severe scenario to inform its models the allowance for credit losses as of december would increase by approximately million however factoring in model overlays and qualitative adjustments could result in a materially different estimate under a more severe scenario qualitative adjustments and model overlays the corporation includes qualitative adjustments as appropriate intended to capture the impact of uncertainties not reflected in the quantitative estimate including foresight risk model imprecisions and input imprecisions qualitative adjustments for foresight risk reflect the inherent imprecision in economic forecasts and may be included based on managements evaluation of different forecast scenarios ranging from more benign to more severe and known recent events impacting the corporations portfolio model imprecision adjustments and model overlays may be included to mitigate known limitations in the quantitative models input imprecision includes adjustments for portfolios where recent historical losses exceed expected losses or known recent events are expected to alter risk ratings once evidence is acquired as well as a qualitative assessment of the lending environment including underwriting standards current economic and political conditions and other factors affecting credit quality qualitative reserves at december primarily included adjustments for uncertainties related to forecasted economic variables other considerations to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates additional provision for credit losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods the allowance is assigned to business segments and any earnings impact resulting from actual outcomes differing from management estimates would primarily affect the commercial bank segment fair value measurement investment securities availableforsale derivatives and deferred compensation plan assets and associated liabilities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis additionally from time to time other assets and liabilities may be recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis such as impaired loans that have been measured based on the fair value of the underlying collateral loans heldforsale recorded at the lower of cost or market other real estate primarily foreclosed property nonmarketable equity securities and certain other assets and liabilities nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve writedowns of individual assets or application of lower of cost or fair value accounting fair value is an estimate of the exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction ie not a forced transaction such as a liquidation or distressed sale between market participants at the measurement date and is based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability fair value measurement and disclosure guidance establishes a threelevel hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value notes and to the consolidated financial statements include information about the fair value hierarchy the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities as well as the valuation methodologies and key inputs used at december assets and liabilities measured using observable inputs that are classified as level or level represented substantially all of total assets and liabilities recorded at fair value respectively valuations generated from modelbased techniques that use at least one significant assumption not observable in the market are considered level and reflect estimates of assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability the valuation of level assets and liabilities are considered critical accounting estimates f36 table of contents goodwill goodwill is initially recorded as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level equivalent to a business segment or one level below the corporation has three reporting units the commercial bank the retail bank and wealth management at december and goodwill totaled million including million allocated to the commercial bank million allocated to the retail bank and million allocated to wealth management the corporation performs its annual evaluation of goodwill impairment in the third quarter of each year and may elect to perform a quantitative impairment analysis or first conduct a qualitative analysis to determine if a quantitative analysis is necessary additionally the corporation evaluates goodwill impairment on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests indicate additional testing may be warranted to determine if goodwill might be impaired during the third quarter of the corporation elected to perform a quantitative impairment analysis the estimated fair values of the reporting units were determined using a blend of two commonly used valuation techniques the market approach and the income approach for the market approach valuations of reporting units considered a combination of earnings and equity multiples from companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit since the fair values determined under the market approach are representative of noncontrolling interests the valuations incorporated a control premium for the income approach estimated future cash flows were derived from internal forecasts and economic expectations for each reporting unit in the short and midterm forecasts incorporated current economic conditions and impacts of expected monetary policy decisions by the federal reserve bank long term projections reflected normalized rate and credit environments as well as a longterm rate of return for each reporting unit projections were discounted using an applicable discount rate to calculate the fair value the discount rate was based on the imputed cost of equity capital for each reporting unit which incorporates the riskfree rate of return a market equity risk premium potential stock volatility and a size risk premium the discount rate further reflected the uncertainty of current economic conditions and potential impacts to the forecasted financial information the combined fair value of all units was compared to the corporations market capitalization for reasonableness at the conclusion of the quantitative impairment test in the third quarter the estimated fair values of all reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying amounts including goodwill the corporation performed a hypothetical sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact to the estimated fair value of each reporting unit from an adverse change in the discount rate a basis point increase in the discount rate would result in the fair value of each reporting unit to continue to substantially exceed its carrying value the corporation continues to monitor economic conditions that could significantly impact the impairment analysis and result in future goodwill impairment charges that if incurred could have a material adverse effect on the corporations results of operations in the period such charges are recognized additionally any new legislative or regulatory changes not anticipated in managements expectations may cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below the carrying value resulting in a goodwill impairment charge any impairment charge would not affect the corporations regulatory capital ratios tangible common equity ratio or liquidity position pension plan accounting the corporation has a qualified and a nonqualified defined benefit pension plan effective january benefits are calculated using a cash balance formula based on years of service age compensation and an interest credit based on the 30year treasury rate participants under age as of december are eligible to receive a frozen final average pay benefit in addition to amounts earned under the cash balance formula participants age or older as of december continue to be eligible for a final average pay benefit the corporation makes assumptions concerning future events that will determine the amount and timing of required benefit payments funding requirements and defined benefit pension expense the major assumptions are the discount rate used in determining the current benefit obligation the longterm rate of return expected on plan assets mix of assets within the portfolio and the projected mortality rate the discount rate is determined by matching the expected cash flows of the pension plans to a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date december the longterm rate of return expected on plan assets is set after considering both longterm returns in the general market and longterm returns experienced by the assets in the plan the current target asset allocation model for the plans is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements the expected returns on these various asset categories are blended to derive one longterm return assumption the assets are primarily invested in certain collective investment funds common stocks us treasury and other us government agency securities as well as corporate and municipal bonds and notes mortality rate assumptions are based on mortality tables published by third f37 table of contents parties such as the society of actuaries considering other available information including historical data as well as studies and publications from reputable sources the corporation reviews its pension plan assumptions on an annual basis with its actuarial consultants to determine if the assumptions are reasonable and adjusts the assumptions to reflect changes in future expectations the major assumptions used to calculate and defined benefit plan pension expense benefit were as follows discount rate longterm rate of return on plan assets mortality table base table a mortality improvement scale a a issued by the society of actuaries pri2012 mp2020 pri2012 mp2020 defined benefit plan benefit is expected to increase million to approximately million in compared to a benefit of million in this includes service cost expense of million and a benefit from other components of million service costs are included in salaries and benefits expense while the benefit from other components are included in other noninterest expenses on the consolidated statements of income the corporations pension plan is most sensitive to changes in discount rate and longterm rate of return a change to the discount rate implies a corresponding change in interest rates that affect the value of the plans fixed income assets an increase of basis points to the discount rate including the effect of higher interest rates on the plans fixed income assets would result in a net increase to pension expense of million while a decrease of basis points would reduce pension expense by million increasing the longterm rate of return by basis points would reduce pension expense by million while a decrease of basis points would increase pension expense by million due to the longterm nature of pension plan assumptions actual results may differ significantly from the actuarialbased estimates differences resulting in actuarial gains or losses are required to be recorded in shareholders equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss and amortized to defined benefit pension expense in future years refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further information income taxes the provision for income taxes is the sum of income taxes due for the current year and deferred taxes deferred taxes arise from temporary differences between the income tax basis and financial accounting basis of assets and liabilities accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from taxing jurisdictions currently or in the future and are included in accrued income and other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets included in net deferred taxes are deferred tax assets deferred tax assets are evaluated for realization based on available evidence of projected future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences assumptions made regarding future events and when applicable state loss carryback capacity a valuation allowance is provided when it is morelikelythannot that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized determining whether deferred tax assets are realizable is subjective and requires the use of significant judgment the corporation assesses the relative risks and merits of tax positions for various transactions after considering statutes regulations judicial precedent and other available information and maintains tax accruals consistent with these assessments this assessment is complex and requires judgment the corporation is subject to audit by taxing authorities that could question andor challenge the tax positions taken by the corporation changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur due to changes in tax law interpretations of existing tax laws new judicial or regulatory guidance the status of examinations conducted by taxing authorities that impact the relative risks and merits of tax positions taken by the corporation these changes when they occur impact the estimate of accrued taxes and could be significant to the operating results of the corporation for further information on tax accruals and related risks see
