strategically aligned its operations into three major business segments the commercial bank the retail bank and wealth management these business segments are differentiated based on the type of customer and the related products and services provided in addition to the three major business segments the finance division is also reported as a segment the other category includes items not directly associated with the business segments or the finance segment the performance of the business segments is not comparable with the corporations consolidated results and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution additionally because of the interrelationships of the various segments the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities note to the consolidated financial statements describes the business activities of each business segment and presents financial results of the business segments for the threemonth periods ended march and the corporations management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each segment using certain methodologies which are regularly reviewed and refined these methodologies may be modified as the management accounting system is enhanced and changes occur in the organizational structure andor product lines note to the consolidated financial statements in the corporations annual report describes the corporations segment reporting methodology net interest income for each segment reflects the interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interestbearing liabilities plus the net impact from associated internal funds transfer pricing ftp the ftp methodology allocates credits to each business segment for deposits and other funds provided as well as charges for loans and other assets being funded ftp crediting rates on deposits and other funds provided reflect the longterm value of deposits and other funding sources based on their implied maturities due to the longerterm nature of implied maturities ftp crediting rates are generally less volatile than changes in interest rates observed in the market ftp charge rates for funding loans and other assets reflect a matched cost of funds based on the pricing and duration characteristics of the assets as a result of applying matched funding interest revenue for each segment resulting from loans and other assets is generally not impacted by changes in interest rates therefore net interest income for each segment primarily reflects the volume of loans and other earning assets at the spread over the matched cost of funds as well as the volume of deposits at the associated ftp crediting rates generally in periods of rising interest rates ftp charge rates for funding loans and ftp crediting rates on deposits will increase with ftp crediting rates for deposits typically repricing at a slower pace than

credit losses covered times and times total nonperforming loans at march and december respectively the allowance for credit losses decreased million from million at december to million at march primarily reflecting strong credit quality and a sustained recovery by the us economy from the covid19 pandemic strong business and consumer spending as well as robust labor markets supported growth in the broader us economy however there continues to be considerable uncertainty related to the impacts of the russiaukraine conflict supply chain constraints future monetary and fiscal policy actions and inflationary pressures these factors shaped the 2year reasonable and supportable forecasts used by the corporation in its cecl estimate at march the us economy is expected to continue to grow at a moderate pace through the first half of before normalizing into historical growth rates forecasts for other key economic variables including the unemployment rate are generally in line with gdp projections while oil prices are expected to decrease throughout the forecast period interest rates are expected to increase reflecting the federal reserves expectations while corporate bond spreads reflect normalized default risk the following table summarizes select economic variables representative of the economic forecasts used to develop the allowance for credit losses estimate at march economic variable base forecast real gross domestic product gdp growth growth near percent in second quarter normalizes to under percent for remainder of forecast period unemployment rate current levels decrease to below percent by fourth quarter with minimal subsequent movement corporate bbb bond to 10year treasury bond spreads remain stable at below percent oil prices prices steadily decline from per barrel in second quarter to below per barrel by the end of the forecast period due to the high level of uncertainty regarding significant assumptions the corporation evaluated a range of economic scenarios including more benign and more severe economic forecasts in the more severe scenario real gdp is expected to contract through fourth quarter gradually improving to a growth rate of percent by the end of the forecast period other key economic variables follow a similar pattern of shortterm contractions followed by a gradual recovery selecting the more severe forecast would result in an increase in the quantitative calculation of allowance for credit losses by approximately million as of march however factoring in model overlays and qualitative adjustments could result in a materially different estimate under a more severe scenario table of contents allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents managements estimates of current expected credit losses in the corporations loan portfolio pools of loans with similar risk characteristics are collectively evaluated while loans that no longer share risk characteristics with loan pools are evaluated individually collective loss estimates are determined by applying reserve factors designed to estimate current expected credit losses to amortized cost balances over the remaining contractual life of the collectively evaluated portfolio loans with similar risk characteristics are aggregated into homogeneous pools the allowance for loan losses also includes qualitative adjustments to bring the allowance to the level management believes is appropriate based on factors that have not otherwise been fully accounted for including adjustments for foresight risk input imprecisions and model imprecision credit losses for loans that no longer share risk characteristics with the loan pools are estimated on an individual basis individual credit loss estimates are typically performed for nonaccrual loans and modified loans classified as troubled debt restructurings tdrs and are based on one of several methods including the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral observable market value of similar debt or the present value of expected cash flows allowance for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments the allowance for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments estimates current expected credit losses on collective pools of letters of credit and unused commitments to extend credit based on reserve factors determined in a manner similar to business loans multiplied by a probability of draw estimate based on historical experience and credit risk applied to commitment amounts the allowance for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments increased million to million at march compared to million at december the following table presents metrics of the allowance for credit losses and nonperforming loans march december allowance for credit losses

adverse movement in prices including interest rates foreign exchange rates commodity prices and equity prices liquidity risk represents the risk that the corporation does not have sufficient access to funds to maintain its normal operations at all times or does not have the ability to raise or borrow funds at a reasonable cost at all times the asset and liability policy committee alco of the corporation establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market and liquidity risk management activities alco meets regularly to discuss and review market and liquidity risk management strategies and consists of executive and senior management from various areas of the corporation including treasury finance economics lending deposit gathering and risk management corporate treasury mitigates market and liquidity risk under the direction of alco through the actions it takes to manage the corporations market liquidity and capital positions the corporation performs monthly liquidity stress testing to evaluate its ability to meet funding needs in hypothetical stressed environments such environments cover a series of scenarios including both idiosyncratic and marketwide in nature which vary in terms of duration and severity the evaluation as of march projected that sufficient sources of liquidity were available under each series of events in addition to assessing liquidity risk on a consolidated basis corporate treasury also monitors the parent companys liquidity and has established liquidity coverage requirements for meeting expected obligations without the support of additional dividends from subsidiaries alcos policy on liquidity risk management requires the parent company to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet expected cash obligations over a period of no less than months the corporation had liquid assets of billion on an unconsolidated basis at march corporate treasury and the enterprise risk division support alco in measuring monitoring and managing interest rate risk as well as all other market risks key activities encompass i providing information and analyses of the corporations balance sheet structure and measurement of interest rate and all other market risks ii monitoring and reporting of the corporations positions relative to established policy limits and guidelines iii developing and presenting analyses and strategies to adjust risk positions iv reviewing and presenting policies and authorizations for approval and v monitoring of industry trends and analytical tools to be used in the management of interest rate and all other market and liquidity risks interest rate risk net interest income is the primary source of revenue for the corporation interest rate risk arises in the normal course of business due to differences in the repricing and cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities primarily through the table of contents corporations core business activities of extending loans and acquiring deposits the corporations balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floatingrate loans funded by core deposits including the impact of interest rate swaps converting floatingrate loans to fixed the corporations loan composition at march was percent 30day rate primarily libor percent fixedrate percent prime and percent comprised of 90day and greater rates additionally percent of total loans had nonzero interest rate floors protecting against future rate declines the composition of the loan portfolio creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to the imbalance between the faster repricing of the floatingrate loan portfolio versus deposit products in addition the growth andor contraction in the corporations loans and deposits may lead to changes in sensitivity to interest rate movements in the absence of mitigating actions examples of such actions are purchasing fixedrate investment securities which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest rate sensitivity as well as hedging with interest rate swaps and options other mitigating factors include interest rate floors on a portion of the loan portfolio the corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity based on the current rising rate environment the corporation anticipates it will continue to add fixedrate investment securities and cash flow hedges over time to manage its interest rate risk by reducing its sensitivity to rate movements and to pull the benefit of future rate increases forward since no single measurement system satisfies all management objectives a combination of techniques is used to manage interest rate risk these techniques examine the impact of interest rate risk on net interest income and the economic value of equity under a variety of alternative scenarios including changes in the level slope and shape of the yield curve utilizing multiple simulation analyses simulation analyses produce only estimates of net interest income as the assumptions used are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from simulated results due to many factors including but not limited to the timing magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates market conditions regulatory impacts and management strategies sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates the analysis of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios is managements principal risk management technique management models a basecase net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment model assumptions in this base case at march included a modest increase in loan balances loan spreads held at current levels a moderate decrease in deposit balances and the securities portfolio held at existing levels the average balance of the securities portfolio was billion for the three months ended march with an average yield of percent and average duration of years including billion purchased during the first quarter of with an average yield of percent and average duration of years at march derivative instruments were comprised of interest rate swaps that convert billion of fixedrate medium and longterm debt to variable rates through fair value hedges and convert billion of variablerate loans to fixed rates through cash flow hedges which had an average rate and time to maturity of percent and years respectively including billion entered into during the first quarter of at an average rate and duration of percent and years respectively as of april billion of securities with an average yield of percent and average duration of years were purchased in the second quarter of in addition during this same period cash flow hedges to convert billion of variablerate loans to fixed rates were entered into which had an average rate and duration of percent and years respectively and varying start dates through october the second quarter purchased securities and cash flow hedges are not included in the interest rate sensitivity model assumptions additionally included in this analysis are billion of loans that were subject to an average interest rate floor of basis points at march this basecase net interest income is then compared against interest rate scenarios in which shortterm rates rise or decline basis points with a floor of zero percent in a linear nonparallel fashion from the base case over months resulting in an average change of basis points over the period while longterm rates increase or decrease to a lesser degree each scenario includes assumptions such as loan growth investment security prepayment levels depositor behavior yield curve changes loan and deposit pricing and overall balance sheet mix and growth which are in line with historical patterns however in this lowrate environment depositors have maintained a higher level of liquidity and their historical behavior may be less indicative of future trends changes in actual economic activity may result in a materially different interest rate environment as well as a balance sheet structure that is different from the changes management included in its simulation analysis table of contents the table below as of march and december displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next months by relating the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above estimated annual change march december dollar amounts in millions amount amount change in interest rates change in interest rates rising basis points rising basis points basis points on average basis points on average declining to zero percent declining to zero percent sensitivity to declining interest rates increased from december to march primarily due to the march increase in the federal funds rate allowing for greater balance sheet repricing before reaching the assumed zero percent lower bound the rate increase was partially offset by additional cash flow hedges and investment securities added during the first quarter of sensitivity to rising interest rates decreased due to cash flow hedges and nonmaturity deposit runoff partially offset by the higher repricing potential of floatingrate loans as they move above their contractual floor rates based on the balance sheet composition and interest rate hedges in existence at march using managements expectations for loan and deposit activity and assuming a basis point increase in the federal funds rate following the may federal open market committee meeting management expects that net interest income for fullyear will increase by more than percent compared to the prior year with net interest income for the second quarter increasing approximately percent compared to the first quarter additionally assuming the implied forward rates as of march including a federal funds rate of to by the end of net interest income for fullyear would be projected to approximate billion a percent increase compared to the prior year the corporation believes securities acquired and cash flow hedges entered into during the second quarter would increase these net interest income estimates sensitivity of economic value of equity to changes in interest rates in addition to the simulation analysis on net interest income an economic value of equity analysis provides an alternative view of the interest rate risk position the economic value of equity is the difference between the estimate of the economic value of the corporations financial assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period and the estimated economic value after applying the estimated impact of rate movements the corporation primarily monitors the percentage change on the basecase economic value of equity the economic value of equity analysis is based on an immediate parallel basis point shock with a floor of zero percent the table below as of march and december displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from the interest rate scenario described above march december dollar amounts in millions amount amount change in interest rates change in interest rates rising basis points rising basis points declining to zero percent declining to zero percent the sensitivity of the economic value of equity to rising rates decreased from december to march primarily due to additional cash flow hedges growth in the securities portfolio and deposit runoff which also led to decreased sensitivity to declining rates limited by the assumption of a zero percent rate floor libor transition on july the united kingdoms financial conduct authority fca which regulates libor publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after effective march the fca confirmed that certain libor tenors will no longer be supported after december and that the remaining tenors including those most commonly used by the corporation will cease to be supported after june the corporation has

bsbybased cash and derivative products the corporation ceased originating liborbased products in the fourth quarter of while communications and learning activities to support customers and colleagues are ongoing as of march the corporation estimates that approximately percent of its liborbased table of contents commercial loans have maturity dates prior to the cessation of libor of the remaining loans with maturity dates beyond the cessation date the corporation estimates that percent incorporate fallback language and is confident that it will achieve timely remediation of all other loans in addition to remediation activity on liborbased loans the corporation has enacted the international swaps and derivatives association isda protocols related to derivatives once events occur that trigger a fallback the reference rate for the variable leg of the swap will fall back from libor to the isda fallback rate which is the daily sofr plus a spread the corporations enterprise transition timelines are closely aligned with recommendations from the alternative reference rates committee for both best practices and recommended objectives the corporation will continue to align with industry and regulatory guidelines regarding the cessation of libor as well as monitor market developments for transitioning to alternative reference rates for a discussion of the various risks facing

december sources of liquidity the corporation maintains a liquidity position that it believes will adequately satisfy its financial obligations while taking into account potential commitment draws and deposit runoff that may occur in the normal course of business the majority of the corporations balance sheet is funded by customer deposits cash flows from loan repayments increases in deposit
