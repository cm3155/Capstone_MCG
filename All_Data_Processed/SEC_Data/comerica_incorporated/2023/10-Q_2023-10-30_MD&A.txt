expenses partially offset by gains on sale of real estate strategic lines of business the corporation has strategically aligned its operations into three major business segments the commercial bank the retail bank and wealth management these business segments are differentiated based on the type of customer and the related products and services provided in addition to the three major business segments the finance division is also reported as a segment the other category includes items not directly associated with the business segments or the finance segment the performance of the business segments is not comparable with the corporations consolidated results and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution additionally because of the interrelationships of the various segments the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities note to the consolidated financial statements describes the business activities of each business segment and presents financial results of the business segments for the three and ninemonth periods ended september and the corporations management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each segment using certain methodologies which are regularly reviewed and refined these methodologies may be modified as the management accounting system is enhanced and changes occur in the organizational structure andor product lines note to the consolidated financial statements in the corporations annual report describes the corporations segment reporting methodology net interest income for each segment reflects the interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interestbearing liabilities plus the net impact from associated internal funds transfer pricing ftp funding credits and charges the ftp methodology allocates credits to each business segment for deposits and other funds provided as well as charges for loans and other assets being funded ftp crediting rates on deposits and other funds provided reflect the longterm value of deposits and other funding sources based on their implied maturities due to the longerterm nature of implied maturities ftp crediting rates are generally less volatile than changes in interest rates observed in the market ftp charge rates for funding loans and other assets reflect a matched cost of funds based on the pricing and duration characteristics of the assets as a result of applying matched funding interest revenue for each segment resulting from loans and other assets is generally not impacted by changes in interest rates therefore net interest income for each segment primarily reflects the volume of loans and other earning assets at the spread over the matched cost of funds as well as the volume of deposits at the associated ftp crediting rates generally in periods of rising interest rates ftp charge rates for funding loans and ftp crediting rates on deposits will increase with ftp crediting rates for deposits typically repricing at a slower pace than ftp charge rates for funding loans business segments

the regulatory capital calculation and the calculation of riskweighted assets across large banking organizations subject to the capital proposal and require category iii and iv banking organizations to include most components of aoci including net unrealized gains and losses on availableforsale securities in their regulatory capital ratios the capital proposal is subject to a public comment period ending november and if adopted would include a threeyear transition period beginning july as of september the corporation had total assets of billion while the capital proposal would not apply to the corporation as it is currently proposed if the corporation becomes subject to the requirements of the capital proposal in the future or becomes subject to any other new laws or regulations related to capital and liquidity such requirements could limit the corporations ability to pay dividends or make share repurchases or require comerica to reduce business levels or to raise capital which would have a material adverse effect on the corporations financial condition and results of operations fdic special assessment in may the fdic issued a notice of proposed rulemaking which would implement a special assessment on banks with total assets greater than billion to recover the cost associated with protecting uninsured depositors following the closures of silicon valley bank and signature bank the fdic is proposing to collect the special assessment for an estimated eight consecutive quarters beginning with the first quarter a final rule is not expected until later in after the fdics final deliberations have concluded as proposed the estimated impact of the special assessment is approximately million which is expected to be recognized upon the rules final issuance the ultimate impact and timing of recognition will depend on the final outcome of the ongoing fdic deliberations risk management the following updated information should be read in conjunction with the risk management section on pages f15 through f30 in the corporations annual report credit risk allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan losses

metrics of the allowance for credit losses and nonperforming loans september december allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans allowance for credit losses as a multiple of total nonaccrual loans allowance for credit losses as a multiple of total nonperforming loans the economic forecasts informing the current expected credit loss cecl model project slower economic activity in the fourth quarter of and in as the cumulative effects of the federal reserve banks tightened monetary policy continue to flow through to the real economy and inflation moderates consumer spending is projected to soften as the support from pandemicera savings dissipates high inflation curbs discretionary spending and student loan payments restart causing employers to slow the pace of hiring energy prices are projected to level off amid crosswinds from the russiaukraine conflict rising us crude production and chinas housing downturn residential and commercial real estate property prices are projected to decline modestly as the long and variable lags of the federal reserve banks tighter monetary policy slow credit intermediation a headwind to real asset prices downside risks to growth from strikes a potential government shutdown geopolitical risks and the restart of student loan payments are projected to collectively contribute to slower growth in price pressures are forecasted to gradually dissipate as a modest margin of slack opens in the economys productive capacity the federal reserve banks aggressive tightening of monetary policy including rapid increases in interest rates and reductions in the size of their balance sheet contribute to elevated risk of a policy error and recession these factors shaped the 2year reasonable and supportable forecasts used by the corporation in its cecl estimate at september the us economy is projected to contract slightly in fourth quarter before returning to growth in at a pace somewhat below expectations for its longerrun average similarly inflation is forecasted to converge toward the federal reserve banks target over the 2year period interest rates are projected to increase in fourth quarter followed by a gradual decline as inflation slows and the federal reserve bank gradually shifts to a less restrictive monetary stance the following table summarizes select variables representative of the economic forecasts used to develop the cecl estimate at september economic variable base forecast real gross domestic product gdp growth slight contraction in the fourth quarter before recovering to a growth rate between percent and percent by the end of the forecast period unemployment rate expected to increase to percent by third quarter followed by a slight decline throughout spread of corporate bbb bond to 10year treasury bond spread widens to percent by second quarter before normalizing to approximately percent by oil prices prices average between and per barrel throughout the forecast period due to the high level of uncertainty regarding conditioning assumptions used as inputs to the forecast the corporation evaluated a range of economic scenarios including more benign and more severe economic forecasts in a more severe scenario real gdp is projected to contract through second quarter subsequently improving to a growth rate of percent by the end of the forecast period other key economic variables follow a similar pattern of shortterm deterioration followed by a recovery except for unemployment levels which remained elevated through the end of the forecast period selecting the more severe forecast would result in an increase in the quantitative calculation of allowance for credit losses of approximately million as of september however factoring in model overlays and qualitative adjustments could result in a materially different estimate under a more severe scenario the corporation monitors evolving economic conditions for impacts to the allowance for credit losses allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents managements estimates of current expected credit losses in the corporations loan portfolio the allowance for loan losses increased million to million at september compared to million at december collective loss estimates are determined by applying reserve factors designed to estimate current expected credit losses to amortized cost balances over the remaining contractual life of the collectively evaluated portfolio loans with similar risk characteristics are aggregated into homogeneous pools the allowance for loan losses also includes qualitative adjustments to bring the allowance to the level management believes is appropriate based on factors that have not otherwise been fully accounted for including adjustments for foresight risk input imprecisions and model imprecision credit losses for loans that no longer share risk characteristics with the loan pools are estimated on an individual basis individual credit loss estimates are typically performed for nonaccrual loans and are based on one of several methods including the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral observable market value of similar debt or the present value of expected cash flows allowance for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments the allowance for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments estimates current expected credit losses on collective pools of letters of credit and unused commitments to extend credit based on reserve factors determined in a manner similar to business loans multiplied by a probability of draw

loss due to adverse movement in prices including interest rates foreign exchange rates commodity prices and equity prices liquidity risk represents the risk that the corporation does not have sufficient access to funds to maintain its normal operations at all times or does not have the ability to raise or borrow funds at a reasonable cost at all times the asset and liability policy committee alco of the corporation establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market and liquidity risk management activities alco meets regularly to discuss and review market and liquidity risk management strategies and consists of executive and senior management from various areas of the corporation including treasury finance economics lending deposit gathering and risk management corporate treasury mitigates market and liquidity risk under the direction of alco through the actions it takes to manage the corporations market liquidity and capital positions the corporation performs monthly liquidity stress testing to evaluate its ability to meet funding needs in hypothetical stressed environments such environments cover a series of scenarios including both idiosyncratic and marketwide in nature which vary in terms of duration and severity recent events have created greater uncertainty with respect to normal deposit patterns following the march banking industry disruption the corporation activated its contingency funding plan by increasing its cash position through wholesale funding channels and brokered deposits the corporations evaluation as of september projected that sufficient sources of liquidity were available under each series of events in addition to assessing liquidity risk on a consolidated basis corporate treasury also monitors the parent companys liquidity and has established liquidity coverage requirements for meeting expected obligations without the support of additional dividends from subsidiaries alcos policy on liquidity risk management requires the parent company to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet expected cash obligations such as debt service dividend payments and normal operating expenses over a period of no less than months the corporation had liquid assets of billion on an unconsolidated basis at september corporate treasury and the enterprise risk division support alco in measuring monitoring and managing interest rate risk as well as all other market risks key activities encompass i providing information and analyses of the corporations balance sheet structure and measurement of interest rate and all other market risks ii monitoring and reporting the corporations positions relative to established policy limits and guidelines iii developing and presenting analyses and strategies to adjust risk positions iv reviewing and presenting policies and authorizations for approval and v monitoring industry trends and analytical tools to be used in the management of interest rate and all other market and liquidity risks interest rate risk net interest income is the primary source of revenue for the corporation interest rate risk arises in the normal course of business due to differences in the repricing and cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities primarily through the corporations core business activities of extending loans and acquiring deposits the corporations balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floatingrate loans funded by core deposits including the impact of interest rate swaps converting floatingrate loans to fixed the corporations loan composition at september was percent fixedrate percent overnight to 30day rate primarily bsby and sofr percent 90day and greater rates and percent prime the composition of the loan portfolio creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to the imbalance between the faster repricing of the floatingrate loan portfolio versus deposit products in addition the growth andor contraction in the corporations loans and deposits may lead to changes in sensitivity to interest rate movements in the absence of mitigating actions examples of such actions are purchasing fixedrate investment securities which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest rate sensitivity as well as hedging with interest rate swaps and options other mitigating factors include interest rate floors on a portion of the loan portfolio the corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity currently from an interest rate risk management perspective the corporation is approximately neutral to basis point gradual interest rate changes since no single measurement system satisfies all management objectives a combination of techniques is used to manage interest rate risk these techniques examine the impact of interest rate risk on net interest income and the economic value of equity under a variety of alternative scenarios including changes in the level slope and shape of the yield curve utilizing multiple simulation analyses simulation analyses produce only estimates of net interest income as the assumptions used are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from simulated results due to many factors including but not limited to the timing magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates market conditions regulatory impacts and management strategies sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates the analysis of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios is managements principal risk management technique management models a basecase net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment using a static balance sheet and generates sensitivity scenarios by changing certain model assumptions each scenario includes assumptions such as loan growth investment security prepayment levels depositor behavior and overall balance sheet mix and growth which are in line with historical patterns changes in actual economic activity may result in a materially different interest rate environment as well as a balance sheet structure that is different from the changes management included in its simulation analysis model assumptions in the sensitivity scenarios at september included for the rising rate scenario a modest increase in loan balances and a moderate decrease in deposit balances and for the declining rate scenario a modest decrease in loan balances and a moderate increase in deposit balances in addition both scenarios assumed loan spreads held at current levels an incremental interestbearing deposit beta of approximately no reinvestment of securities portfolio cash flows and no additions to interest rate swaps the average balance of the securities portfolio included in the analysis was billion for the three months ended september with an average yield of and effective duration of years the table below details components of the cash flow hedge portfolio at september cash flow hedges dollar amounts in millions notional amount weighted average yield years to maturity a swaps under contract at september b weighted average notional active per period full year full year full year a years to maturity calculated from a starting date of september b includes forward starting swaps of billion starting in and billion starting in excluding forward starting swaps the weighted average yield was the analysis also includes interest rate swaps that convert billion of fixedrate medium and longterm debt and fhlb advances to variable rates through fair value hedges additionally included in this analysis are billion of loans that were subject to an average interest rate floor of basis points at september this basecase net interest income is then compared against interest rate scenarios in which shortterm rates rise or decline basis points with a floor of zero percent in a linear parallel fashion from the base case over months resulting in an average change of basis points over the period the table below as of september and december displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next months by relating the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above estimated annual change september december dollar amounts in millions amount amount change in interest rates change in interest rates rising basis points rising basis points basis points on average basis points on average declining basis points declining basis points basis points on average basis points on average sensitivity to declining interest rates decreased from december to september resulting from a decline in nonmaturity deposits partially offset by an increase in time deposits sensitivity to rising interest rates at september remained relatively stable compared to december resulting from refinements to modeled deposit runoff following the change in balance sheet mix that occurred during the year at september additional sensitivity scenarios applied the rising and declining basis point scenario assumptions with a incremental deposit beta relative to the base case scenario to assess the impact of the corporations deposit beta assumptions in these rising and declining scenarios net interest income decreased by million and increased by million respectively due to a more rapid repricing pace compared to the standard model assumptions all scenarios presented for september reflected a change in balance sheet composition following the march banking industry disruption as the balance sheet maintained a higher concentration of cash as well as increased wholesale funding and brokered deposits which contributed to the decrease in net interest income in all scenarios presented sensitivity of economic value of equity to changes in interest rates in addition to the simulation analysis on net interest income an economic value of equity analysis provides an alternative view of the interest rate risk position the economic value of equity is the difference between the estimate of the economic value of the corporations financial assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period and the estimated economic value after applying the estimated impact of rate movements the corporation primarily monitors the percentage change on the basecase economic value of equity the economic value of equity analysis is based on an immediate parallel basis point shock with a floor of zero percent the table below as of september and december displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from the interest rate scenario described above september december dollar amounts in millions amount amount change in interest rates change in interest rates rising basis points rising basis points declining basis points declining basis points the negative sensitivity of the economic value of equity to rising rates increased from december to september due to deposit runoff partially offset by a declining notional amount of cash flow swaps and a smaller securities portfolio sensitivity to declining rates increased the economic value of equity due to the same factors libor transition on july the united kingdoms financial conduct authority fca which regulates libor publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after effective march the fca confirmed that certain libor tenors would no longer be supported after december and that the remaining tenors including those most commonly used by the corporation would no longer be supported after june the corporation had substantial exposure to liborbased products ceased originating liborbased products in the fourth quarter and has worked to remediate its outstanding libor contracts as of september substantially all of the corporations libor exposure was remediated and remaining liborbased contracts are expected to transition to other reference rates at their next repricing dates for a

application of accounting policies the most significant of which are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in the corporations annual report these policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions which may prove inaccurate or subject to variations changes in underlying factors assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the corporations future financial condition and results of operations at december the most critical of these estimates related to the allowance for credit losses fair value measurement pension plan accounting and income taxes these estimates were reviewed with the audit committee of the corporations board of directors and are discussed more fully on pages f31 through f34 in the corporations annual report below is an addition to the critical accounting estimates disclosed in the corporations annual report goodwill goodwill is initially recorded as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level equivalent to a business segment or one level below the corporation has three reporting units the commercial bank the retail bank and wealth management at september and december goodwill totaled million including million allocated to the commercial bank million allocated to the retail bank and million allocated to wealth management the corporation performs its annual evaluation of goodwill impairment in the third quarter of each year and may elect to perform a quantitative impairment analysis or first conduct a qualitative analysis to determine if a quantitative analysis is necessary additionally the corporation evaluates goodwill impairment on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests indicate additional testing may be warranted to determine if goodwill might be impaired during the third quarter of the corporation elected to perform a quantitative impairment analysis the estimated fair values of the reporting units were determined using a blend of two commonly used valuation techniques the market approach and the income approach for the market approach valuations of reporting units considered a combination of earnings and equity multiples from companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit since the fair values determined under the market approach are representative of noncontrolling interests the valuations incorporated a control premium for the income approach estimated future cash flows were derived from internal forecasts and economic expectations for each reporting unit in the short and midterm forecasts incorporated current economic conditions and impacts of expected monetary policy decisions by the federal reserve bank longterm projections reflected normalized rate and credit environments as well as a longterm rate of return for each reporting unit projections were discounted using an applicable discount rate to calculate the fair value the discount rate was based on the imputed cost of equity capital for each reporting unit which incorporates the riskfree rate of return a market equity risk premium potential stock volatility and a size risk premium the discount rate further reflected the uncertainty of current economic conditions and potential impacts to the forecasted financial information the combined fair value of all units was compared to the corporations market capitalization for reasonableness at the conclusion of the quantitative impairment test in the third quarter the estimated fair values of all reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying amounts including goodwill the corporation performed a hypothetical sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact to the estimated fair value of each reporting unit from an adverse change in the discount rate a basis point increase in the discount rate would result in the fair value of each reporting unit to continue to substantially exceed its carrying value the corporation continues to monitor economic conditions that could significantly impact the impairment analysis and result in future goodwill impairment charges that if incurred could have a material adverse effect on the corporations results of operations in the period such charges are recognized additionally any new legislative or regulatory changes not anticipated in managements expectations may cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below the carrying value resulting in a goodwill impairment charge any impairment charge would not affect the corporations regulatory capital ratios
