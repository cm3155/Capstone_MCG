                                        we believe our business and results of operations will be impacted in the future by various trends and conditions for a discussion of certain trends and conditions see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsbusiness trends and conditions in our form 10k for a discussion of how certain trends and conditions impacted the three and nine months ended september see results of operations seasonality                                                                                              we experience fluctuations in transaction volumes and the level of loan receivables as a result of higher seasonal consumer spending and payment patterns that typically result in an increase of loan receivables from august through a peak in late december with reductions in loan receivables typically occurring over the first and second quarters of the following year as customers pay their balances down the seasonal impact to transaction volumes and the loan receivables balance typically results in fluctuations in our results of operations delinquency metrics and the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loan receivables between quarterly periods in addition to the seasonal variance in loan receivables discussed above we also typically experience a seasonal increase in delinquency rates and delinquent loan receivables balances during the third and fourth quarters of each year due to lower customer payment rates resulting in higher net chargeoff rates in the first and second quarters our delinquency rates and delinquent loan receivables balances typically decrease during the subsequent first and second quarters as customers begin to pay down their loan balances and return to current status resulting in lower net chargeoff rates in the third and fourth quarters because customers who were delinquent during the fourth quarter of a calendar year have a higher probability of returning to current status when compared to customers who are delinquent at the end of each of our interim reporting periods we expect that a higher proportion of delinquent accounts outstanding at an interim period end will result in chargeoffs as compared to delinquent accounts outstanding at a year end consistent with this historical experience we generally experience a higher allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loan receivables at the end of an interim period as compared to the end of a calendar year in addition despite improving credit metrics such as declining past due amounts we may experience an increase in our allowance for credit losses at an interim period end compared to the prior year end reflecting these same seasonal trends while the effects of the seasonal trends discussed above have remained evident during the nine months ended september we also continue to experience elevated customer payment behavior which include the effects of governmental stimulus actions industrywide forbearance measures and elevated consumer savings while we have experienced some moderation in the three months ended september customer payments as a percentage of beginningofperiod loan receivables remain significantly elevated compared to historical averages and corresponding delinquency rates and net chargeoff rates are below our historical average during the three months ended september we have experienced an increase in our delinquency rates that reflects both the seasonal trends discussed above and some moderation of customer payment rates results of operations                                                                                              highlights for the three and nine months ended september below are highlights of our performance

to meet regulatory expectations under normal and stress conditions we maintain policies outlining the overall framework and general principles for managing liquidity risk across our business which is the responsibility of our asset and liability management committee a subcommittee of the risk committee of our board of directors we employ a variety of metrics to monitor and manage liquidity we perform regular liquidity stress testing and contingency planning as part of our liquidity management process we evaluate a range of stress scenarios including company specific and systemic events that could impact funding sources and our ability to meet liquidity needs we maintain a liquidity portfolio which at september had billion of liquid assets primarily consisting of cash and equivalents and shortterm obligations of the us treasury less cash in transit which is not considered to be liquid compared to billion of liquid assets at december the increase in liquid assets was primarily due to deposit growth to accommodate the seasonality of our business and billion of proceeds from portfolios sold during the second quarter of partially offset by loan receivables growth in the nine months ended september we believe our liquidity position at september remains strong as we continue to operate in a period of uncertain economic conditions and we will continue to closely monitor our liquidity as economic conditions change as additional sources of liquidity at september we had an aggregate of billion of undrawn committed capacity on our securitized financings subject to customary borrowing conditions from private lenders under our securitization programs and billion of undrawn committed capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility with private lenders and we had more
