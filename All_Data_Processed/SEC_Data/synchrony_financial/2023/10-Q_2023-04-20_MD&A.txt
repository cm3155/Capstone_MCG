various trends and conditions for a discussion of certain trends and conditions see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsbusiness trends and conditions in our form 10k for a discussion of how certain trends and conditions impacted the three months ended march see results of operations seasonality                                                                                              we experience fluctuations in transaction volumes and the level of loan receivables as a result of higher seasonal consumer spending and payment patterns that typically result in an increase of loan receivables from august through a peak in late december with reductions in loan receivables typically occurring over the first and second quarters of the following year as customers pay their balances down the seasonal impact to transaction volumes and the loan receivables balance typically results in fluctuations in our results of operations delinquency metrics and the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loan receivables between quarterly periods in addition to the seasonal variance in loan receivables discussed above we also typically experience a seasonal increase in delinquency rates and delinquent loan receivables balances during the third and fourth quarters of each year due to lower customer payment rates resulting in higher net chargeoff rates in the first and second quarters our delinquency rates and delinquent loan receivables balances typically decrease during the subsequent first and second quarters as customers begin to pay down their loan balances and return to current status resulting in lower net chargeoff rates in the third and fourth quarters because customers who were delinquent during the fourth quarter of a calendar year have a higher probability of returning to current status when compared to customers who are delinquent at the end of each of our interim reporting periods we expect that a higher proportion of delinquent accounts outstanding at an interim period end will result in chargeoffs as compared to delinquent accounts outstanding at a year end consistent with this historical experience we generally experience a higher allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loan receivables at the end of an interim period as compared to the end of a calendar year in addition even in instances of improving credit metrics such as declining past due amounts we may experience an increase in our allowance for credit losses at an interim period end compared to the prior year end reflecting these same seasonal trends the seasonal trends discussed above are most evident between the fourth quarter and the first quarter of the following year particularly with respect to our loan receivables which decreased by billion or to billion at march compared to billion at december and our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loan receivables that increased to at march from at december however in addition to these seasonal trends the elevated customer payment behavior we have experienced in recent years and more recently the subsequent moderation from these elevated levels has also significantly impacted our key financial metrics and the fluctuations experienced between quarterly periods the effects from these changes in customer payment behavior have resulted in either partial or in some instances full offset to the impact from the ongoing seasonal trends discussed above this is most evident in our past due balances which increased to billion at march from billion at december due to the impact from lower customer payment rates which exceeded the effects of the seasonal trends we experienced the same factors also provided a partial offset to the seasonal decrease in our loan receivables in the first quarter of results of operations                                                                                              highlights for the three months ended march below are highlights of our performance for the three months ended march compared to the three months ended march as applicable except as otherwise noted net earnings decreased to million from million the decrease in the three months ended march was primarily driven by increases in provision for credit losses and higher interest expense partially offset by higher interest income and lower retailer share arrangements loan receivables increased to billion at march compared to billion at march driven by purchase volume growth and lower customer payment rates net interest income increased to billion for the three months ended march interest and fees on loans increased for the three months ended march primarily driven by growth in

increased basis points to for the three months ended march provision for credit losses increased to billion from million for the three months ended march primarily driven by higher net chargeoffs and

operations fund asset growth satisfy debt obligations and to meet regulatory expectations under normal and stress conditions we maintain policies outlining the overall framework and general principles for managing liquidity risk across our business which is the responsibility of our asset and liability management committee a subcommittee of the risk committee of our board of directors we employ a variety of metrics to monitor and manage liquidity we perform regular liquidity stress testing and contingency planning as part of our liquidity management process we evaluate a range of stress scenarios including company specific and systemic events that could impact funding sources and our ability to meet liquidity needs we maintain a liquidity portfolio which at march had billion of liquid assets primarily consisting of cash and equivalents and shortterm obligations of the us treasury less cash in transit which is not considered to be liquid compared to billion of liquid assets at december the increase in liquid assets was primarily due to deposit growth issuance of subordinated unsecured debt and the seasonality of our business we believe our liquidity position at march remains strong as we continue to operate in a period of uncertain economic conditions and we will continue to closely monitor our liquidity as economic conditions change as additional sources of liquidity at march we had an aggregate of billion of undrawn committed capacity on our securitized financings subject to customary borrowing conditions from private lenders under our securitization programs and billion of undrawn committed capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility with private lenders and we had more than billion of unencumbered assets in the bank available to be used to generate additional liquidity through secured borrowings or asset sales or to be pledged to the federal reserve board for credit at the discount window as a general matter investments included in our liquidity portfolio are expected to be highly liquid giving us the ability to readily convert them to cash the level and composition of our liquidity portfolio may fluctuate based upon the level of expected maturities of our funding sources as well as operational requirements and market conditions we rely significantly on dividends and other distributions and payments from the bank for
