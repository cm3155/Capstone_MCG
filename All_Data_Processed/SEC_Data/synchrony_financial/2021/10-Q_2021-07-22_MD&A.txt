certain trends and conditions see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsbusiness trends and conditions in our form 10k for a discussion of how certain trends and conditions impacted the three and six months ended june see results of operations seasonality                                                                                              we experience fluctuations in transaction volumes and the level of loan receivables as a result of higher seasonal consumer spending and payment patterns that typically result in an increase of loan receivables from august through a peak in late december with reductions in loan receivables occurring over the first and second quarters of the following year as customers pay their balances down the seasonal impact to transaction volumes and the loan receivables balance typically results in fluctuations in our results of operations delinquency metrics and the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loan receivables between quarterly periods in addition to the seasonal variance in loan receivables discussed above we also typically experience a seasonal increase in delinquency rates and delinquent loan receivables balances during the third and fourth quarters of each year due to lower customer payment rates resulting in higher net chargeoff rates in the first and second quarters our delinquency rates and delinquent loan receivables balances typically decrease during the subsequent first and second quarters as customers begin to pay down their loan balances and return to current status resulting in lower net chargeoff rates in the third and fourth quarters because customers who were delinquent during the fourth quarter of a calendar year have a higher probability of returning to current status when compared to customers who are delinquent at the end of each of our interim reporting periods we expect that a higher proportion of delinquent accounts outstanding at an interim period end will result in chargeoffs as compared to delinquent accounts outstanding at a year end consistent with this historical experience we generally experience a higher allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loan receivables at the end of an interim period as compared to the end of a calendar year in addition despite improving credit metrics such as declining past due amounts we may experience an increase in our allowance for credit losses at an interim period end compared to the prior year end reflecting these same seasonal trends while the effects of the seasonal trends discussed above remain evident we also continue to experience improvements in customer payment behavior which include the effects of governmental stimulus actions and industrywide forbearance measures customer payments as a percentage of beginningofperiod loan receivables for the three months ended june were approximately basis points higher than our prior fiveyear historical average for the second quarter these higher payment rates have resulted in reductions in loan receivables and delinquency rates beyond our seasonal expectations results of operations

ability to meet liquidity needs we maintain a liquidity portfolio which at june had billion of liquid assets primarily consisting of cash and equivalents and shortterm obligations of the us treasury less cash in transit which is not considered to be liquid compared to billion of liquid assets at december the decrease in liquid assets was primarily due to the reduction in funding liabilities partially offset by the reduction in our loan receivables and the seasonality of our business we believe our liquidity position at june remains strong as we continue to operate in a period of uncertain economic conditions related to covid19 and we will continue to closely monitor our liquidity as economic conditions change as additional sources of liquidity at june we had an aggregate of billion of undrawn committed capacity on our securitized financings subject to customary borrowing conditions from private lenders under our securitization programs and billion of undrawn committed

external loan modification programs we use longterm modification programs for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty as a loss mitigation strategy to improve longterm collectability of the loans that are classified as tdrs the longterm program involves changing the structure of the loan to a fixed payment loan with a maturity no longer than months and reducing the interest rate on the loan the longterm program does not normally provide for the forgiveness of unpaid principal but may allow for the reversal of certain unpaid interest or fee assessments we also make loan modifications for customers who request financial assistance through external sources such as consumer credit counseling agency programs these loans typically receive a reduced interest rate but continue to be subject

loan receivables are largely comprised of our openended consumer and commercial revolving credit card loans as part of our credit risk management activities on an ongoing basis we assess overall credit quality by reviewing information related to the performance of a customers account with us including delinquency information as well as information from credit bureaus relating to the customers broader credit performance we utilize vantagescore credit scores to assist in our assessment of credit quality vantagescore credit scores are obtained at origination of the account and are refreshed at a minimum quarterly but could be as often as weekly to assist in predicting customer behavior we categorize these credit scores into the following three credit score categories i or higher which are considered the strongest credits ii to considered moderate credit risk and iii or less which are considered weaker credits there are certain customer accounts for which a vantagescore score is not available where we use alternative sources to assess their credit and predict behavior the following table provides the most recent vantagescore scores available for our customers at june and december

with any vie and we did not provide noncontractual support for previously transferred loan receivables to any vie in the three and six months ended june and our vies are able to accept new loan receivables and arrange new assetbacked financings consistent with the requirements and limitations on such activities placed on the vie by existing investors once an account has been designated to a vie the contractual arrangements we have require all existing and future loan receivables originated under such account to be transferred to the vie the amount of loan receivables held by our vies in excess of the minimum amount required under the assetbacked financing arrangements with investors may be removed by us under removal of accounts provisions all loan receivables held by a vie are subject to claims of thirdparty investors in evaluating whether we have the power to direct the activities of a vie that most significantly impact its economic performance we consider the purpose for which the vie was created the importance of each of the activities in which it is engaged and our decisionmaking role if any in those activities that significantly determine the entitys economic performance as compared to other economic interest holders this evaluation requires consideration of all facts and circumstances relevant to decisionmaking that affects the entitys future performance and the exercise of professional judgment in deciding which decisionmaking rights are most important in determining whether we have the right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to a vie we evaluate all of our economic interests in the entity regardless of form debt equity management and servicing fees and other contractual arrangements this evaluation considers all relevant factors of the entitys design including the entitys capital structure contractual rights to earnings or losses subordination of our interests relative to those of other investors as well as any other contractual arrangements that might exist that could have the potential to be economically significant the evaluation of each of these factors in reaching a conclusion about the potential significance of our economic interests is a matter that requires the exercise of professional judgment we consolidate vies where we have the power to direct the activities that significantly affect the vies economic performance typically because of our role as either servicer or administrator for the vies the power to direct exists because of our role in the design and conduct of the servicing of the vies assets as well as directing certain affairs of the vies including determining whether and on what terms debt of the vies will be issued the loan receivables in these entities have risks and characteristics similar to our other financing receivables and were underwritten to the same standard accordingly the performance of these assets has been similar to our other comparable loan receivables and the blended performance of the pools of receivables in these entities reflects the eligibility criteria that we apply to determine which receivables are selected for transfer contractually the cash flows from these financing receivables must first be used to pay thirdparty debt holders as well as other expenses of the entity excess

capital adequacy as a savings and loan holding company and a financial holding company we are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve board and subject to the capital requirements as prescribed by basel iii capital rules and the requirements of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the bank is a federally chartered savings association as such the bank is subject to regulation supervision and examination by the office of the comptroller of the currency of the us treasury the occ which is its primary regulator and by the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb in addition the bank as an insured depository institution is supervised by the fdic failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could limit our business activities and have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements under capital adequacy guidelines we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets liabilities and certain offbalancesheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices the capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components risk weightings and other factors quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require us and the bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios set forth in the tables below of total tier and common equity tier capital as defined in the regulations to riskweighted assets as defined and of tier capital to average assets as defined for synchrony financial to be a wellcapitalized savings and loan holding company the bank must be wellcapitalized and synchrony financial must not be subject to any written agreement order capital directive or prompt corrective action directive issued by the federal reserve board to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure in march the joint federal bank regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule that allows banking organizations that implemented cecl in to mitigate the effects of the cecl accounting standard in their regulatory capital for two years the company has elected to adopt the option provided by the interim final rule which will largely delay the effects of

bonus payments to executive officers and similar employees the bank may pay dividends on its stock with consent or nonobjection from the occ and the federal reserve board among other things if its regulatory capital would not thereby be reduced below the applicable regulatory capital requirements note earnings per share basic earnings per share is computed by dividing earnings available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period diluted earnings per common share reflects the assumed conversion of all dilutive securities the following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per common share three months ended june six months ended june in millions except per share data net earnings preferred stock

from the computation of diluted earnings per common share note income taxes unrecognized tax benefits in millions june december unrecognized tax benefits excluding related interest expense and penalties a portion that if recognized would reduce tax expense and effective tax rate b a interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits were not material for all periods presented b comprised of federal unrecognized tax benefits and state and local unrecognized tax benefits net of the effects of associated us federal income taxes excludes amounts attributable to any related valuation allowances resulting from associated increases in deferred tax assets we establish a liability that represents the difference between a tax position taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return and the amount of taxes recognized in our financial statements the liability associated with the unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically when new information becomes available the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that is reasonably possible to be resolved in the next twelve months is expected to be million of which million if recognized would reduce the companys tax expense and effective tax rate in the current year the company executed a memorandum of understanding with the irs to participate voluntarily in the irs compliance assurance process cap program for the tax year and thus the tax year is under irs review the irs is also examining our and tax years which are our only open years subject to irs examination it is reasonably possible that the irs will complete the examinations of the and tax years in the next months additionally we are under examination in various states going back to we believe that there are no issues or claims that are likely to significantly impact our results of operations financial position or cash flows we further believe that we have made adequate provision for all income tax uncertainties that could result from such examinations note legal proceedings and regulatory matters in the normal course of business from time to time we have been named as a defendant in various legal proceedings including arbitrations class actions and other litigation arising in connection with our business activities certain of the legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory andor punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages we are also involved from time to time in reviews investigations and proceedings both formal and informal by governmental agencies regarding our business collectively regulatory matters which could subject us to significant fines penalties obligations to change our business practices or other requirements resulting in increased expenses diminished income and damage to our reputation we contest liability andor the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter in accordance with applicable accounting guidance we establish an accrued liability for legal and regulatory matters when those matters present loss contingencies which are both probable and reasonably estimable legal proceedings and regulatory matters are subject to many uncertain factors that generally cannot be predicted with assurance and we may be exposed to losses in excess of any amounts accrued for some matters we are able to determine that an estimated loss while not probable is reasonably possible for other matters including those that have not yet progressed through discovery andor where important factual information and legal issues are unresolved we are unable to make such an estimate we currently estimate that the reasonably possible losses for legal proceedings and regulatory matters whether in excess of a related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability and for which we are able to estimate a possible loss are immaterial this represents managements estimate of possible loss with respect to these matters and is based on currently available information this estimate of possible loss does not represent our maximum loss exposure the legal proceedings and regulatory matters underlying the estimate will change from time to time and actual results may vary significantly from current estimates our estimate of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment given the varying stages of the proceedings the existence of numerous yet to be resolved issues the breadth of the claims often spanning multiple years unspecified damages andor the novelty of the legal issues presented based on our current knowledge we do not believe that we are a party to any pending legal proceeding or regulatory matters that would have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated financial condition or liquidity however in light of the uncertainties involved in such matters the ultimate outcome of a particular matter could be material to our operating results for a particular period depending on among other factors the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of our earnings for that period and could adversely affect our business and reputation below is a description of certain of our regulatory matters and legal proceedings on november a putative class action lawsuit retail wholesale department store union local retirement fund v synchrony financial et al was filed in the us
