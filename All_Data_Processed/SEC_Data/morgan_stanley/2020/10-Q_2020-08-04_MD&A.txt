its involvement with vies see note to the financial statements in the form 10k june form 10q notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited significant accounting policies for a detailed discussion about the firms significant accounting policies and for further information on accounting updates adopted in the prior year see note to the financial statements in the form 10k during the six months ended june current year period there were no significant revisions to the firms significant accounting policies other than for the accounting updates adopted accounting updates adopted in reference rate reform the firm adopted the reference rate reform accounting update in the current quarter there was no impact to the firms financial statements upon initial adoption this accounting update provides optional accounting relief to entities with contracts hedge accounting relationships or other transactions that reference libor or other interest rate benchmarks for which the referenced rate is expected to be discontinued or replaced the firm is applying the accounting relief as relevant contract and hedge accounting relationship modifications are made during the course of the reference rate reform transition period the optional relief generally allows for contract modifications solely related to the replacement of the reference rate to be accounted for as a continuation of the existing contract instead of as an extinguishment of the contract and would therefore not trigger certain accounting impacts that would otherwise be required it also allows entities to change certain critical terms of existing hedge accounting relationships that are affected by reference rate reform and these changes would not require dedesignating the hedge accounting relationship the optional relief ends december financial instrumentscredit losses the firm adopted the financial instruments credit losses accounting update on january this accounting update impacted the impairment model for certain financial assets measured at amortized cost by requiring a cecl methodology to estimate expected credit losses over the entire life of the financial asset recorded at inception or purchase cecl replaced the loss model previously applicable to loans held for investment htm securities and other receivables carried at amortized cost such as employee loans the update also eliminated the concept of otherthantemporary impairment for afs securities and instead requires impairments on afs securities to be recognized in earnings through an allowance when the fair value is less than amortized cost and a credit loss exists and through a permanent reduction of the amortized cost basis when the securities are expected to be sold before recovery of amortized cost for certain portfolios we determined that there are de minimus or zero expected credit losses for example for lending and financing transactions such as securities borrowed securities purchased under agreements to resell and certain other portfolios where collateral arrangements are being followed also we have zero expected credit losses for certain financial assets based on the credit quality of the borrower or issuer such as us government and agency securities at transition on january the adoption of this accounting standard resulted in an increase in the allowance for credit losses of million with a corresponding reduction in retained earnings of million net of tax the adoption impact was primarily attributable to a million increase in the allowance for credit losses on employee loans the following discussion highlights changes to the firms accounting policies as a result of this adoption instruments measured at amortized cost and certain offbalance sheet credit exposures allowance for credit losses the acl for financial instruments measured at amortized cost and certain offbalance sheet exposures eg hfi loans and lending commitments htm securities customer and other receivables and certain guarantees represents an estimate of expected credit losses over the entire life of the financial instrument factors considered by management when determining the acl include payment status fair value of collateral expected payments of principal and interest as well as internal or external information relating to past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts the firms three forecasts include assumptions about certain macroeconomic variables including but not limited to us gross domestic product equity market indices unemployment rates as well as commercial real estate and home price indices at the conclusion of the firms reasonable and supportable forecast period of quarters there is a gradual reversion back to historical averages the acl is measured on a collective basis when similar risk characteristics exist for multiple instruments considering all available information relevant to assessing the collectability of cash flows generally the firm applies a probability of defaultloss given default model for instruments that are collectively assessed under which the acl is calculated as the product of probability of default loss given default and exposure at default these parameters are forecast for each collective group of assets using a scenariobased statistical model and at the conclusion of the firms reasonable and supportable forecast period the parameters gradually revert back to historical averages june form 10q notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited if the instrument does not share similar risk characteristics with other instruments including when it is probable that the firm will be unable to collect the full payment of principal and interest on the instrument when due the acl is measured on an individual basis the firm generally applies a discounted cash flow method for instruments that are individually assessed the firm may also elect to use an approach that considers the fair value of the collateral when measuring the acl if the loan is collateral dependent ie repayment of the loan is expected to be provided substantially by the sale or operation of the underlying collateral and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty additionally the firm can elect to use an approach to measure the acl using the fair value of collateral where the borrower is required to and reasonably expected to continually adjust and replenish the amount of collateral securing the instrument to reflect changes in the fair value of such collateral the firm has elected to use this approach for certain securitiesbased loans customer receivables representing margin loans securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed credit quality indicators considered in developing the acl include corporate loans secured lending facilities commercial real estate loans and securities and other loans internal risk ratings developed by the credit risk management department which are refreshed at least annually and more frequently as necessary these ratings generally correspond to external ratings published by sp the firm also considers transaction structure including type of collateral collateral terms and position of the obligation within the capital structure in addition for commercial real estate the firm considers property type and location net operating income ltv ratios among others as well as commercial real estate price and credit spread indices and capitalization rates residential real estate loans loan origination fair isaac corporation fico credit scores as determined by independent credit agencies in the united states and loantovalue ltv ratios employee loans employment status which includes those currently employed by the firm and for which the firm can deduct any unpaid amounts due to it through certain compensation arrangements and those no longer employed by the firm where such compensation arrangements are no longer applicable for securitiesbased loans the firm generally measures the acl based on the fair value of collateral qualitative and environmental factors such as economic and business conditions the nature and volume of the portfolio and lending terms and the volume and severity of past due loans are also considered in the acl calculations recognition the firm recognizes its acl and provision for credit losses in its balance sheets and income statements respectively for on and offbalance sheet instruments as follows acl provision for credit losses instruments measured at amortized cost eg hfi loans htm securities and customer and other receivables contra asset other revenue employee loans contra asset compensation and benefits expense offbalance sheet instruments eg hfi lending commitments and certain guarantees other liabilities and accrued expenses other expense troubled debt restructurings tdrs the firm may modify the terms of certain loans for economic or legal reasons related to a borrowers financial difficulties by granting one or more concessions that the firm would not otherwise consider such modifications are accounted for and reported as a tdr except for certain modifications related to the coronavirus disease covid19 as noted in modifications and nonaccrual status for borrowers impacted by covid19 herein a loan that has been modified in a tdr is generally considered to be impaired and is evaluated individually tdrs are also generally classified as nonaccrual and may be returned to accrual status only after the firm expects repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest and there is sustained repayment performance for a reasonable period nonaccrual the firm places financial instruments on nonaccrual status if principal or interest is past due for a period of days or more or payment of principal or interest is in doubt unless the obligation is wellsecured and in the process of collection or in certain cases when related to covid19 as noted in modifications and nonaccrual status for borrowers impacted by covid19 herein for any instrument placed on nonaccrual status the firm reverses any unpaid interest accrued with an offsetting reduction to interest income principal and interest payments received on nonaccrual instruments are applied to principal if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of principal if collection of the principal is not in doubt interest income is realized on a cash basis if neither principal nor interest collection is in doubt and the instruments are brought current instruments are generally placed on accrual status and interest income is recognized using the effective interest method june form 10q notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited modifications and nonaccrual status for borrowers impacted by covid19 in the first quarter of the firm elected to apply the guidance issued by congress in the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act as well as by the us banking agencies stating that certain concessions granted to borrowers that are current on existing loans either individually or as part of a program for creditworthy borrowers who are experiencing shortterm financial or operational problems as a result of covid19 generally would not be considered tdrs additionally these loans generally would not be considered nonaccrual status unless collectability concerns exist despite the modification provided for loans remaining on accrual status the firm elected to continue recognizing interest income during the modification periods acl writeoffs the firm writesoff a financial instrument in the period that it is deemed uncollectible and records a reduction in the acl and the balance of the financial instrument in the balance sheet however for accrued interest receivable balances that are separately recorded from the related financial instruments the firms nonaccrual policy requires that accrued interest receivable be written off against interest income when the related financial instrument is placed in nonaccrual status accordingly the firm elected not to measure an acl for accrued interest receivables however in the case of loans which are modified as a result of covid19 and remain on accrual status due to the relief noted in modifications and nonaccrual status for borrowers impacted by covid19 accrued interest receivable balances are assessed for any required acl availableforsale afs investment securities afs securities are reported at fair value in the balance sheets interest income including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts is included in interest income in the income statements afs securities in an unrealized gain position at the end of the reporting period are reflected in aoci and afs securities in an unrealized loss position are treated as follows unrealized losses on afs securities afs securities in an unrealized loss position that the firm either has the intent to sell or that the firm is likely to be required to sell before recovery of its amortized cost basis require a writeoff of any previously established acl as well as a writedown of amortized cost basis to the securitys fair value with any incremental unrealized losses reported in other revenues for all other afs securities in an unrealized loss position the firm assesses whether credit losses exist at the individual security level and reflects the credit losses in the acl accordingly when considering if a credit loss exists the firm considers relevant information as discussed in note of the form 10k upon the adoption of financial instrumentscredit losses the firm no longer considers the length of time the fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis in determining whether a credit loss exists recognition if a credit loss exists the firm recognizes its acl and provision for credit losses for afs securities in its balance sheets and income statements respectively as follows acl provision for credit losses afs securities contra investment securities other revenue the firm recognizes the noncredit loss component of the unrealized loss as an adjustment to the securitys value with an offsetting entry to aoci in the balance sheets nonaccrual acl writeoffs on afs securities afs securities follow the same nonaccrual and writeoff guidance as discussed in instruments measured at amortized cost and certain offbalance sheet credit exposures herein except as set forth in modifications and nonaccrual status for borrowers impacted by covid19
