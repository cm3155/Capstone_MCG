referenced investments that employees select compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period relevant to each separately vesting portion of deferred awards the firm invests directly as a principal in financial instruments and other investments to economically hedge certain of its obligations under these deferred cashbased compensation plans changes in the value of such investments are recorded in trading and investments revenues although changes in compensation expense resulting from changes in the fair value of the referenced investments will generally be offset by changes in the fair value of investments made by the firm there is typically a timing difference between the immediate recognition of gains and losses on the firms investments and the deferred recognition of the

certain accounting updates which we have either determined are not applicable or are not expected to have a significant impact on our financial statements critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap which requires us to make estimates and assumptions see note to the financial statements we believe that of our significant accounting policies see note to the financial statements the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity fair value financial instruments measured at fair value a significant number of our financial instruments are carried at fair value we make estimates regarding the valuation of assets and liabilities measured at fair value in preparing the financial statements these assets and liabilities include but are not limited to trading assets and trading liabilities investment securitiesafs certain securities purchased under agreements to resell certain deposits primarily certificates of deposit certain securities sold under agreements to repurchase certain other secured financings and certain borrowings fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability ie the exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in determining fair value we use various valuation approaches a hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable prices and inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable prices and inputs by requiring that the relevant observable inputs be used when available the hierarchy is broken down into three levels wherein level represents quoted prices in active markets level represents valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable and level consists of valuation techniques that incorporate significant unobservable inputs and therefore require the greatest use of judgment in periods of market disruption the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments which could cause an instrument to be recategorized from level to level or from level to level in addition a downturn in market conditions could lead to declines in the valuation of many instruments for further information on the definition of fair value level level level and related valuation techniques and quantitative information about and sensitivity of significant unobservable inputs used in level fair value measurements see notes and to the financial statements where appropriate valuation adjustments are made to account for various factors such as liquidity risk bidask adjustments credit quality model uncertainty concentration risk and funding in order to arrive at fair value for a further table start december form 10k table end table start managements discussion and analysis table end discussion of valuation adjustments that we apply see note to the financial statements goodwill and intangible assets goodwill we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of july and on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist evaluating goodwill for impairment requires management to make significant judgments including in part the use of unobservable inputs that are subject to uncertainty goodwill impairment tests are performed at the reporting unit level which is generally at the level of or one level below our business segments goodwill no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition once it has been assigned to a reporting unit as such all the activities of a reporting unit whether acquired or organically developed are available to support the value of the goodwill for both the annual and interim tests we have the option to either i perform a quantitative impairment test or ii first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount in which case the quantitative test would be performed when performing a quantitative impairment test we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the goodwill impairment loss is equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value limited by the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit the estimated fair value of the reporting units is derived based on valuation techniques we believe market participants would use for each of the reporting units the estimated fair value is generally determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology or methodologies that incorporate pricetobook and pricetoearnings multiples of certain comparable companies at each annual goodwill impairment testing date each of our reporting units with goodwill had a fair value that was substantially in excess of its carrying value intangible assets intangible assets are initially recorded at cost or in the situation where acquired as part of a business combination at the fair value determined as part of the acquisition method of accou nting subsequently amortizable intangible assets are carried in the balance sheet at amortized cost where amortization is recognized over their estimated useful lives indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested for impairment on an annual basis as of july and on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist on a quarterly basis all intangible assets are assessed for the presence of impairment indicators where such indicators are present an evaluation for impairment is conducted for amortizable intangible assets an impairment loss exists if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows for indefinitelived intangible assets an impairment exists if the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value amortizable intangible assets are assessed for any indication that the remaining useful life or the finite life classification should be revised in such cases the remaining carrying amount is amortized prospectively over the revised useful life unless it is determined that the life of the intangible asset is indefinite in which case the intangible asset is not amortized indefinitelived intangible assets are assessed for any indication that the life of the intangible asset is no longer indefinite in such cases the carrying amount of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over its remaining useful life the initial valuation of an intangible asset as part of the acquisition method of accounting and the subsequent valuation of intangible assets as part of an impairment assessment are subjective and based in part on inputs that are unobservable and can be subject to uncertainty these inputs include but are not limited to forecasted cash flows revenue growth rates customer attrition rates and discount rates for both goodwill and intangible assets to the extent an impairment loss is recognized the loss establishes the new cost basis of the asset subsequent reversal of impairment losses is not permitted for amortizable intangible assets the new cost basis is amortized over the remaining useful life of that asset adverse market or economic events could result in impairment charges in future periods see notes and to the financial statements for additional information about goodwill and intangible assets legal and regulatory contingencies in the normal course of business we have been named from time to time as a defendant in various legal actions including arbitrations class actions and other litigation arising in connection with our activities as a global diversified financial services institution certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory andor punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages in some cases the entities that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or are in financial distress table start december form 10k table end table start managements discussion and analysis table end we are also involved from time to time in other reviews investigations and proceedings both formal and informal by governmental and selfregulatory agencies regarding our business and involving among other matters sales financing primebrokerage marketmaking activities wealth and investment management services financial products or offerings sponsored underwritten or sold by us and accounting and operational matters certain of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief accruals for litigation and regulatory proceedings are generally determined on a casebycase basis where available information indicates that it is probable a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and we can reasonably estimate the amount of that loss we accrue the estimated loss by a charge to income in many proceedings and investigations however it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible or to estimate the amount of any loss in addition even where a loss is possible or an exposure to loss exists in excess of the liability already accrued with respect to a previously recognized loss contingency it is not always possible to reasonably estimate the size of the possible loss or range of loss particularly for proceedings and investigations where the factual record is being developed or contested or where plaintiffs or government entities seek substantial or indeterminate damages restitution disgorgement or penalties numerous issues may need to be resolved before a loss or additional loss or range of loss or additional range of loss can be reasonably estimated for a proceeding or investigation including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters determination of issues related to class certification and the calculation of damages or other relief and consideration of novel or unsettled legal questions relevant to the proceedings or investigations in question significant judgment is required in deciding when and if to make these accruals and the actual cost of a legal claim or regulatory finepenalty may ultimately be materially different from the recorded accruals see note to the financial statements for additional information on legal contingencies income taxes we are subject to the income and indirect tax laws of the us its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations these tax laws are complex and subject to interpretation by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining the provision for income taxes and the expense for indirect taxes and must also make estimates about when certain items affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit we periodically evaluate the likelihood of assessments in each taxing jurisdiction resulting from current and subsequent years examinations and unrecognized tax benefits related to potential losses that may arise from tax audits are established in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance once established unrecognized tax benefits are adjusted when there is more information available or when an event occurs requiring a change our provision for income taxes is composed of current and deferred taxes current income taxes approximate taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the applicable enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse our deferred tax balances may also include deferred assets related to tax attribute carryforwards such as net operating losses and tax credits that will be realized through reduction of future tax liabilities and in some cases are subject to expiration if not utilized within certain periods we perform regular reviews to ascertain whether deferred tax assets are realizable these reviews include managements estimates and assumptions regarding future taxable income and incorporate various tax planning strategies including strategies that may be available to tax attribute carryforwards before they expire once the deferred tax asset balances have been determined we may record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset balances to reflect the amount we estimate is more likely than not to be realized at a future date both current and deferred income taxes may reflect adjustments related to our unrecognized tax benefits significant judgment is required in estimating the consolidated provision for benefit from income taxes current and deferred tax balances including valuation allowance if any accrued interest or penalties and uncertain tax positions revisions in estimates andor the actual costs of a tax assessment may

management framework sufficient liquidity resources should be maintained to cover maturing liabilities and other planned and contingent outflows maturity profile of assets and liabilities should be aligned with limited reliance on shortterm funding source counterparty currency region and term of funding should be diversified and liquidity stress tests should anticipate and account for periods of limited access to funding the core components of our liquidity risk management framework are the required liquidity framework liquidity stress tests and liquidity resources which support our target liquidity profile required liquidity framework our required liquidity framework establishes the amount of liquidity we must hold in both normal and stressed table start december form 10k table end table start managements discussion and analysis table end environments to ensure that our financial condition and overall soundness are not adversely affected by an inability or perceived inability to meet our financial obligations in a timely manner the required liquidity framework considers the most constraining liquidity requirement to satisfy all regulatory and internal limits at a consolidated and legal entity level liquidity stress tests we use liquidity stress tests to model external and intercompany liquidity flows across multiple scenarios and a range of time horizons these scenarios contain various combinations of idiosyncratic and systemic stress events of different severity and duration the methodology implementation production and analysis of our liquidity stress tests are important components of the required liquidity framework the assumptions used in our various liquidity stress test scenarios include but are not limited to the following no government support no access to equity and limited access to unsecured debt markets repayment of all unsecured debt maturing within the stress horizon higher haircuts for and significantly lower availability of secured funding additional collateral that would be required by trading counterparties certain exchanges and clearing organizations related to credit rating downgrades additional collateral that would be required due to collateral substitutions collateral disputes and uncalled collateral discretionary unsecured debt buybacks drawdowns on lending commitments provided to third parties and client cash withdrawals and reduction in customer short positions that fund long positions liquidity stress tests are produced and results are reported at different levels including major operating subsidiaries and major currencies to capture specific cash requirements and cash availability across the firm including a limited number of asset sales in a stressed environment the liquidity stress tests assume that subsidiaries will use their own liquidity first to fund their obligations before drawing liquidity from the parent company and that the parent company will support its subsidiaries and will not have access to subsidiaries liquidity reserves in addition to the assumptions underpinning the liquidity stress tests we take into consideration settlement risk related to intraday settlement and clearing of securities and financing activities at december and december we maintained sufficient liquidity resources to meet current and contingent funding obligations as modeled in our liquidity

funding management we manage our funding in a manner that reduces the risk of disruption to our operations we pursue a strategy of diversification of secured and unsecured funding sources by product investor and region and attempt to ensure that the tenor of our liabilities equals or exceeds the expected holding period of the assets being financed our goal is to achieve an optimal mix of durable secured and unsecured financing we fund our balance sheet on a global basis through diverse sources these sources include our equity capital borrowings securities sold under agreements to repurchase securities lending deposits letters of credit and lines of credit we have active financing programs for both standard and structured products targeting global investors and currencies secured financing the liquid nature of the marketable securities and shortterm receivables arising principally from sales and trading activities in the institutional securities business segment provides us with flexibility in managing the composition of our balance sheet secured financing investors principally focus on the quality of the eligible collateral posted accordingly we actively manage our secured financings based on the quality of the assets being funded we have established longer tenor secured funding requirements for less liquid asset classes for which funding may be at risk in the event of a market disruption we define highly liquid assets as governmentissued or governmentguaranteed securities with a high degree of fundability and less liquid assets as those that do not meet these criteria to further minimize the refinancing risk of secured financing for less liquid assets we have established concentration limits to diversify our investor base and reduce the amount of monthly maturities for secured financing of less liquid assets furthermore we obtain term secured funding liabilities in excess of less liquid inventory as an additional risk mitigant to replace maturing trades in the event that secured financing markets or our ability to access them become limited as a component of the liquidity risk management framework we hold a portion of our liquidity

policies and the elements of our liquidity risk management framework unsecured financing we view deposits and borrowings as stable sources of funding for unencumbered securities and nonsecurity assets our unsecured financings include borrowings and certificates of deposit carried at fair value which are primarily composed of instruments whose payments and redemption values are linked to the performance of a specific index a basket of stocks a specific equity security a commodity a credit exposure or basket of credit exposures and instruments with various interest raterelated features including stepups stepdowns and zero coupons also included are unsecured contracts which are not classified as otc derivatives because they fail net investment criteria as part of our assetliability

provide consistent access to the unsecured markets in addition the issuance of borrowings with original maturities greater than one year allows us to reduce reliance on shortterm credit sensitive instruments borrowings with original maturities greater than one year are generally managed to achieve staggered maturities thereby mitigating refinancing risk and to maximize investor diversification

the parent company has entered into an amended and restated support agreement with its material entities including the funding ihc and certain other subsidiaries in the event of a resolution scenario the parent company would be obligated to contribute all of its contributable assets to our material entities andor the funding ihc the funding ihc would be obligated to provide capital and liquidity

the holders of eligible longterm debt and other forms of eligible tlac issued by the parent company before any losses are imposed on creditors of our material entities and without requiring taxpayer or government financial support the obligations of the parent company and the funding ihc under the amended and restated support agreement are in most cases secured on a senior basis by the assets of
