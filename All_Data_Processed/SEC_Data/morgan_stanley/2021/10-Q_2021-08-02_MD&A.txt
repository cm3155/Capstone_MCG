estimated loss by a charge to income in many proceedings and investigations however it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible or to estimate the amount of any loss in addition even where a loss is possible or an exposure to loss exists in excess of the liability already accrued with respect to a previously recognized loss contingency it is not always possible to reasonably estimate the size of the possible loss or range of loss particularly for proceedings and investigations where the factual record is being developed or contested or where plaintiffs or government entities seek substantial or indeterminate damages restitution disgorgement or penalties numerous issues may need to be resolved before a loss or additional loss or range of
