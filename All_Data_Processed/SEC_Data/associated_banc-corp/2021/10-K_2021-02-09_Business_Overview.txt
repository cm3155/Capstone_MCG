other mutual funds brokerage houses and various other financial institutions additionally we compete with insurance companies leasing companies regulated small loan companies credit unions governmental agencies and commercial entities offering financial services products including nonbank lenders and socalled financial technology companies competition involves among other things efforts to retain current customers and to obtain new loans and deposits the scope and types of services offered interest rates paid on deposits and charged on loans as well as other aspects of banking we also face direct competition from subsidiaries of bank holding companies that have far greater assets and resources than ours supervision and regulation overview the corporation and its banking and nonbanking subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation and oversight both at the federal and state levels the following is an overview of the statutory and regulatory framework that affects the business of the corporation and our subsidiaries bhc act requirements as a registered bank holding company under the bhc act we are regulated supervised and examined by the federal reserve in connection with applicable requirements bank holding companies file periodic reports and other information with the federal reserve the bhc act also governs the activities that are permissible for bank holding companies and their affiliates and permits the federal reserve in certain circumstances to issue cease and desist orders and other enforcement actions against bank holding companies and their nonbanking affiliates to correct and curtail unsafe or unsound banking practices under the doddfrank act and longstanding federal reserve policy bank holding companies are required to act as a source of financial strength to each of their banking subsidiaries pursuant to which such holding company may be required to commit financial resources to support such subsidiaries in circumstances when absent such requirements they might not otherwise do so the bhc act further regulates holding company activities including requirements and limitations relating to capital transactions with officers directors and affiliates securities issuances dividend payments interaffiliate liabilities extensions of credit and expansion through mergers and acquisitions the bhc act allows certain qualifying bank holding companies that elect treatment as financial holding companies to engage in activities that are financial in nature and that explicitly include the underwriting and sale of insurance the parent company thus far has not elected to be treated as a financial holding company bank holding companies that have not elected such treatment generally must limit their activities to banking activities and activities that are closely related to banking on january the federal reserve finalized a rule that simplifies and increases transparency of its rules for determining when one company controls another company for purposes of the bhc act the rule became effective september the rule has and will likely continue to have a meaningful impact on control determinations related to investments in banks and bank holding companies and investments by bank holding companies in nonbank companies regulation of associated bank and trust company subsidiaries associated bank and our nationally chartered trust company subsidiary are regulated supervised and examined by the occ the occ has primary supervisory and regulatory authority over the operations of associated bank and the corporations trust company subsidiary as part of this authority associated bank and our trust company subsidiaries are required to file periodic reports with the occ and are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the occ to support its supervisory function the occ has the authority to assess and charge fees on all national banks according to a set fee schedule on december due to increased operating efficiencies the occ announced that it will reduce the rates in all fee schedules by percent for the calendar year thus reducing the assessment fees that associated bank will pay in this reduction is an addition to the occs final rule passed on june which reduced the assessments paid to the occ on september in response to the impact of the covid19 pandemic associated bank our only subsidiary that accepts insured deposits is also subject to examination by the fdic we are subject to the enforcement and rulemaking authority of the cfpb regarding consumer financial products the cfpb has the authority to create and enforce consumer protection rules and regulations and has the power to examine us for compliance with such rules and regulations the cfpb also has the authority to prohibit unfair deceptive or abusive acts and practices the cfpb has examination and enforcement authority over all banks with more than billion in assets such as associated bank the doddfrank act weakens the federal preemption available for national banks and gives broader rights to state attorneys general to enforce certain federal consumer protection laws on may the president signed into law the economic growth act which repealed or modified several important provisions of the doddfrank act among other things the economic growth act raises the total asset thresholds to billion for doddfrank act annual companyrun stress testing leverage limits liquidity requirements and resolution planning requirements for bank holding companies subject to the ability of the federal reserve to apply such requirements to institutions with assets of billion or more to address financial stability risks or safety and soundness concerns on october the occ adopted a final rule implementing portions of the economic growth act which among other things raises the minimum threshold for national banks to conduct stress tests from billion to billion as a result of the final rule which was effective as of november the bank is no longer subject to doddfrank act stress testing requirements the economic growth act also enacted several important changes in some technical compliance areas for which the banking agencies have now issued certain corresponding guidance documents andor proposed or final rules including prohibiting federal banking regulators from imposing higher capital standards on hvcre exposures unless they are for adc and clarifying adc status requiring the federal banking agencies to amend the liquidity coverage ratio rule such that all qualifying investmentgrade liquid and readilymarketable municipal securities are treated as level liquid assets making them more attractive investment alternatives exempting from appraisal requirements certain transactions involving real property in rural areas and valued at less than and directing the cfpb to provide guidance on the applicability of the tilarespa integrated disclosure rule to mortgage assumption transactions and constructiontopermanent home loans as well the extent to which lenders can rely on model disclosures that do not reflect recent regulatory changes legislative and regulatory responses to the covid19 pandemic the covid19 pandemic is creating extensive disruptions to the global economy to businesses and to the lives of individuals throughout the world there have been a number of regulatory actions intended to help mitigate the adverse economic impact of the covid19 pandemic on borrowers including several mandates from the bank regulatory agencies requiring financial institutions to work constructively with borrowers affected by the covid19 pandemic in addition the governors of many states in which we do business or in which our borrowers and loan collateral are located have issued temporary bans on evictions and foreclosures the governor of minnesota suspended landlords ability to file eviction actions except in very limited circumstances until the statewide emergency declaration ends further although wisconsins ban on residential and commercial evictions has expired illinois has extended its ban on residential evictions through march there continues to be mounting pressure on governors and localities to take further relief action on march the cares act was signed into law the cares act is a trillion economic stimulus bill that was intended to provide relief in the wake of the covid19 pandemic several provisions within the cares act led to action from the bank regulatory agencies and there were also separate provisions within the legislation that directly impacted financial institutions section of the cares act allows until the earlier of december or the date the national emergency declared by the president terminates borrowers with federallybacked onetofour family mortgage loans experiencing a financial hardship due to the covid19 pandemic to request forbearance regardless of delinquency status for up to days section also prohibited servicers of federallybacked mortgage loans from initiating foreclosures during the 60day period beginning march further on august the fhfa announced that fnma and fhlmc would extend their singlefamily moratorium on foreclosures and evictions through december in addition president biden requested that the federal agencies discussed above continue to extend the moratorium on foreclosures on federallyguaranteed mortgages until at least march in addition under section of the cares act until the earlier of december and the date the national emergency declared by the president terminates borrowers with federallybacked multifamily mortgage loans whose payments were current as of february but who have since experienced financial hardship due to covid19 may request a forbearance for up to days borrowers receiving such forbearance may not evict or charge late fees to tenants for its duration on december the fhfa announced an extension of forbearance programs for qualifying multifamily properties through march these regulatory and legislative actions may be expanded extended and amended as the pandemic and its economic impact continue the bank regulatory agencies ensure that adequate flexibility will be given to financial institutions who work with borrowers affected by the covid19pandemic and indicate that they will not criticize institutions who do so in a safe and sound manner further the bank regulatory agencies have encouraged financial institutions to report accurate information to credit bureaus regarding relief provided to borrowers and have urged the importance of financial institutions to continue assisting those borrowers impacted by the covid19 pandemic also on april the bank regulatory agencies issued a joint policy statement to facilitate mortgage servicers ability to place consumers in shortterm payment forbearance programs this policy statement was followed by a final rule on june that makes it easier for consumers to transition out of financial hardship caused by the covid19 pandemic the rule makes it clear that servicers do not violate regulation x which places restrictions and requirements upon lenders mortgage brokers or servicers of home loans related to consumers when they apply and receive mortgage loans by offering certain covid19related loss mitigation options based on an evaluation of limited application information collected from the borrower also in an attempt to allow individuals and businesses to more quickly access real estate equity on september the bank regulatory agencies issued a rule that deferred appraisal and evaluation requirements after the closing of certain residential and cre transactions through december on january upon the inauguration of president biden the new administration issued an executive order extending the federal eviction moratorium issued through the centers for disease control and preventionwhich was recently extended by congress through january 2021through march as part of the covid19 relief package proposed by the administration this eviction moratorium would be further extended through september if adopted as proposed further on december the coronavirus response and relief supplemental appropriations act of was signed into law which also contains provisions that could directly impact financial institutions the act directs financial regulators to support community development financial institutions and minority depository institutions and directs congress to reappropriate billion in unobligated cares act funds the ppp originally established under the cares act and extended under the coronavirus response and relief supplemental appropriations act of authorizes financial institutions to make federallyguaranteed loans to qualifying small businesses and nonprofit organizations these loans carry an interest rate of per annum and a maturity of years for loans originated prior to june and years for loans originated on or after june the ppp provides that such loans may be forgiven if the borrowers meet certain requirements with respect to maintaining employee headcount and payroll and the use of the loan proceeds after the loan is originated the initial phase of the ppp after being extended multiple times by congress expired on august however on january the sba reopened the ppp for first draw ppp loans to small business and nonprofit organizations that did not receive a loan through the initial ppp phase further on january the sba reopened the ppp for second draw ppp loans to small businesses and nonprofit organizations that did receive a loan through the initial ppp phase at least billion has been set aside for second draw ppp loans to eligible borrowers with a maximum of employees or for loans of or less to eligible borrowers in low or moderate income neighborhoods generally speaking businesses with more than employees andor less than a percent reduction in gross receipts between comparable quarters in and are not eligible for second draw ppp loans further maximum loan amounts have been increased for accommodation and food service businesses also the federal reserve in cooperation with the department of the treasury has established many financing and liquidity programs the mslp is intended to keep credit flowing to small and midsized businesses that were in sound financial condition before the coronavirus pandemic but now need financing to maintain operations the ppplf supplies liquidity to ppp participating financial institutions through term financing backed by ppp loans and the mmlf is intended to assist money market funds in meeting demands for redemptions by households and other investors enhancing overall market functioning and credit provision to the broader economy further the federal bank regulatory agencies issued several interim final rules throughout the course of to neutralize the regulatory capital and liquidity effects for banks that participate in the federal reserve liquidity facilities the interim final rule issued on april clarifies that a zero percent risk weight applies to loans covered by the ppp for capital purposes and the interim final rule issued on may permits depository institutions to choose to exclude us treasury securities and deposits at federal reserve banks from the calculation of the supplementary leverage ratio these interim final rules were finalized on september banking acquisitions we are required to obtain prior federal reserve approval before acquiring more than of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company bank or savings association in addition the prior approval of the occ is required for a national bank to merge with another bank or purchase the assets or assume the deposits of another bank in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition federal bank regulators will consider among other factors the effect of the acquisition on competition the public benefits expected to be received from the acquisition the projected capital ratios and levels on a postacquisition basis and the acquiring institutions record of addressing the credit needs of the communities it serves including the needs of low and moderate income neighborhoods consistent with the safe and sound operation of the bank under the cra see the risk factors section for a more extensive discussion of this topic banking subsidiary dividends the parent company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank and other nonbanking subsidiaries a substantial portion of our cash flow comes from dividends paid to us by associated bank the occs prior approval of the payment of dividends by associated bank to the parent company is required only if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year exceeds the sum of the banks retained net income for that year and its retained net income for the preceding two calendar years less any required transfers to surplus federal law also prohibits national banks from paying dividends that would be greater than the banks undivided profits after deducting statutory bad debt in excess of the banks allowance for loan losses in addition under the fdicia an insured depository institution such as the bank is prohibited from making capital distributions including the payment of dividends if after making such distribution the institution would become undercapitalized as such term is used in the fdicia holding company dividends in addition we and the bank are subject to various general regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends including requirements to maintain adequate capital above regulatory minimums the appropriate federal regulatory authority is authorized to determine under certain circumstances relating to the financial condition of a bank or bank holding company that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof under the doddfrank act and the requirements of the frb the parent company as a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial strength to the bank and to commit resources to support the bank in addition consistent with its source of strength policy the frb has stated that as a matter of prudent banking a bank holding company should not maintain a level of cash dividends to its shareholders that places undue pressure on the capital of its bank subsidiaries or that can be funded only through additional borrowings or other arrangements that may undermine the bank holding companys ability to serve as a source of strength the appropriate federal regulatory authorities have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a banks capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice and that banking organizations should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings capital requirements we are subject to various regulatory capital requirements both at the parent company and at the bank level administered by the federal reserve and the occ respectively failure to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could have an adverse material effect on our financial condition and results of operations under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action described below we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets liabilities and certain offbalance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting policies our capital amounts and classification are also subject to judgments by the regulators regarding qualitative components risk weightings and other factors we have consistently maintained regulatory capital ratios at or above the well capitalized standards in july the federal reserve and the occ issued final rules establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for us banking organizations these rules implemented certain provisions of the doddfrank act and basel iii the final rules seek to strengthen the components of regulatory capital increase riskbased capital requirements and make selected changes to the calculation of riskweighted assets the final rules among other things revise minimum capital requirements and adjust prompt corrective action thresholds revise the components of regulatory capital and create a new capital measure called common equity tier which must constitute at least of riskweighted assets specify that tier capital consists only of cet1 and certain additional tier capital instruments meeting specified requirements apply most deductionsadjustments to regulatory capital measures to cet1 and not to other components of capital potentially requiring higher levels of cet1 in order to meet minimum ratio requirements increase the minimum tier capital ratio requirement from to retain the existing riskbased capital treatment for family residential mortgage exposures permit most banking organizations including the parent company to retain through a onetime permanent election the existing capital treatment for accumulated other comprehensive income implement a new capital conservation buffer of cet1 capital equal to of riskweighted assets which is in addition to the cet1 capital ratio and be phased in over a three year period beginning january this buffer is generally required to make capital distributions and pay executive bonuses increase capital requirements for past due loans hvcre exposures and certain shortterm loan commitments require the deduction of msas and dtas that exceed of cet1 capital in each category and of cet1 capital in the aggregate and remove references to credit ratings consistent with the doddfrank act and establish due diligence requirements for securitization exposures in november the federal banking agencies adopted a final rule to extend the regulatory capital treatment applicable during under the capital rules for certain items including regulatory capital deductions risk weights and certain minority interest limitations the relief provided under the final rule applies to banking organizations that are not subject to the capital rules advanced approaches such as the corporation specifically the final rule extends the regulatory capital treatment of msas and dtas arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of common stock nonsignificant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions that are not in the form of common stock and cet1 minority interest tier minority interest and total capital minority interest exceeding the capital rules minority interest limitations in july the federal banking agencies issued a final rule simplifying aspects of the capital rule the key elements of which apply solely to banking organizations that are not subject to the advanced approaches capital rule under the final rule banking organizations which are not subject to the advanced approaches capital rule such as the corporation will be subject to simpler regulatory capital requirements for msas certain dtas arising from temporary differences and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions compared to those currently applied the final rule also simplifies the calculation for the amount of capital issued by a consolidated subsidiary of a banking organization and held by third parties sometimes referred to as a minority interest that is includable in regulatory capital specifically the final rule eliminates i the capital rules percent cet capital deduction threshold that applies individually to msas temporary difference dtas and significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of common stock ii the aggregate percent cet1 capital deduction threshold that subsequently applies on a collective basis across such items iii the percent cet1 capital deduction threshold for nonsignificant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions and iv the deduction treatment for significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions not in the form of common stock the capital rule will no longer have distinct treatments for significant and nonsignificant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions but instead will require that banking organizations not subject to the advanced approaches capital rule deduct from cet1 capital any amount of msas temporary difference dtas and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions that individually exceeds percent of cet1 capital the final rule will be effective on april and supersedes the transition rule the federal banking agencies adopted in to allow banking organizations not subject to the advanced approaches capital rule to continue to apply the transition treatment in effect in in december the federal banking agencies issued a final rule on the capital treatment of hvcre exposures which brought the regulatory definition of hvcre exposure in line with the statutory definition of hvcre adc in the economic growth act the final rule also clarifies the capital treatment for loans that finance the development of land under the revised hvcre exposure definition and establishes the requirements for certain exclusions from hvcre exposures capital treatment we believe we will continue to exceed all capital requirements necessary to be deemed wellcapitalized for all regulatory purposes under these new rules on a fully phasedin basis for further detail on capital and capital ratios see discussion under the liquidity and capital sections under part ii item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and under part ii item financial statements and supplementary data note regulatory matters of the notes to consolidated financial statements in december the basel committee on banking supervision published the last version of the basel iii accord generally referred to as basel iv the basel committee stated that a key objective of the revisions incorporated into the framework is to reduce excessive variability of riskweighted assets which will be accomplished by enhancing the robustness and risk sensitivity of the standardized approaches for credit risk and operational risk this will facilitate the comparability of banks capital ratios constraining the use of internally modeled approaches and complementing the riskweighted capital ratio with a finalized leverage ratio and a revised and robust capital floor leadership of the federal reserve occ and fdic who are tasked with implementing basel iv supported the revisions under the current us capital rules operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to advanced approaches institutions and not to the corporation the impact of basel iv on us will depend on the manner in which it is implemented by the federal bank regulators current expected credit loss treatment in june the fasb issued an accounting standard update financial instrumentscredit losses topic measurement of credit losses on financial instruments which replaces the current incurred loss model for recognizing credit losses with an expected loss model referred to as the cecl model under the cecl model we are required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost such as loans held for investment and htm debt securities at the net amount expected to be collected the measurement of expected credit losses is to be based on information about past events including historical experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount on december the federal banking agencies approved a final rule modifying their regulatory capital rules and providing an option to phase in over a period of three years the dayone regulatory capital effects of the cecl model the final rule also revises the agencies other rules to reflect the update to the accounting standards the final rule took effect april however on august the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule that allows institutions that adopted the cecl accounting standard in the option to mitigate the estimated capital effects of cecl for two years followed by a threeyear transition period taken together these measures offer institutions a transition period of up to five years the corporation has elected to utilize the capital transition relief as permitted under applicable regulations on may four federal banking agencies issued an interagency policy statement on the new cecl methodology the policy statement harmonizes the agencies policies on acl with the fasbs new accounting standards specifically the statement updates concepts and practices from prior policy statements issued in december and july and specifies which prior guidance documents are no longer relevant describes the appropriate cecl methodology in light of topic for determining acls on financial assets measured at amortized cost net investments in leases and certain offbalance sheet credit exposures and describes how to estimate an acl for an impaired afs debt security in line with topic the proposed policy statement is effective at the time that each institution adopts the new standards required by the fasb capital planning and stress testing requirements as part of the regulatory relief provided by the economic growth act the asset threshold requiring insured depository institutions to conduct and report to their primary federal bank regulators annual companyrun stress tests was raised from billion to billion in total consolidated assets and the requirement was made periodic rather than annual upon enactment the economic growth act also provided that bank holding companies under billion in assets were no longer subject to stress testing requirements the amended regulations also provide the federal reserve with discretion to subject bank holding companies with more than billion in total assets to enhanced supervision in addition section of the economic growth act and its implementing regulation prohibit the federal banking agencies from requiring the bank to assign a heightened risk weight to certain hvcre adc loans as previously required under the basel iii capital rules notwithstanding these regulatory amendments the federal banking agencies indicated through interagency guidance that the capital planning and risk management practices of institutions with total assets less than billion would continue to be reviewed through the regular supervisory process although the corporation will continue to monitor and stress test its capital consistent with the safety and soundness expectations of the federal regulators the corporation will no longer publish stress testing results as a result of the legislative and regulatory amendments enforcement powers of the federal banking agencies prompt corrective action the federal reserve the occ and the cfpb have extensive supervisory authority over their regulated institutions including among other things the power to compel higher reserves the ability to assess civil money penalties the ability to issue ceaseanddesist or removal orders and the ability to initiate injunctive actions in general these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations or for unsafe or unsound banking practices other actions or inactions by the parent company may provide the basis for enforcement action including misleading or untimely reports federal banking regulators are authorized and under certain circumstances required to take certain actions against banks that fail to meet their capital requirements the federal banking agencies have additional enforcement authority with respect to undercapitalized depository institutions well capitalized institutions may generally operate without supervisory restriction adequately capitalized institutions cannot normally pay dividends or make any capital contributions that would leave them undercapitalized they cannot pay a management fee to a controlling person if after paying the fee they would be undercapitalized and they cannot accept renew or roll over any brokered deposit unless the bank has applied for and been granted a waiver by the fdic we note that the economic growth act provides that reciprocal deposits are not treated as brokered deposits in the case of a well capitalized institution that received an outstanding or a good rating on its most recent examination to the extent the amount of such deposits does not exceed the lesser of billion or of the banks total liabilities the federal banking agencies are required to take action to restrict the activities of an undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized insured depository institution any such bank must submit a capital restoration plan that is guaranteed by the parent holding company until such plan is approved it may not increase its assets acquire another institution establish a branch or engage in any new activities and generally may not make capital distributions in certain situations a federal banking agency may reclassify a wellcapitalized institution as adequately capitalized and may require an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution to comply with supervisory actions as if the institution were in the next lower category institutions must file a capital restoration plan with the occ within days of the date it receives a notice from the occ that it is undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized compliance with a capital restoration plan must be guaranteed by a parent holding company in addition the occ is permitted to take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions including but not limited to the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors finally bank regulatory agencies have the ability to impose higher than normal capital requirements known as individual minimum capital requirements for institutions with a highrisk profile at december the bank satisfied the capital requirements necessary to be deemed well capitalized in the event of a change to this status the imposition of any of the measures described above could have a material adverse effect on the corporation and on its profitability and operations the corporations shareholders do not have preemptive rights and therefore if the corporation is directed by the occ or the fdic to issue additional shares of common stock such issuance may result in dilution in shareholders percentage of ownership of the corporation deposit insurance premiums associated bank is a member of the fdic and pays an insurance premium to the fdic based upon its assessment rates on a quarterly basis deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the fdic and such insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government under the doddfrank act a permanent increase in deposit insurance was authorized to per depositor per insured depository institution for each account ownership category the doddfrank act also set the minimum dif reserve ratio at of estimated insured deposits the fdic was required to attain this ratio by september the doddfrank act also required the fdic to define the deposit insurance assessment base for an insured depository institution as an amount equal to the institutions average consolidated total assets during the assessment period minus average tangible equity the assessment rate schedule for larger institutions like associated bank ie institutions with at least billion in assets differentiates between such large institutions by use of a scorecard that combines an institutions camels ratings with certain forwardlooking financial information to measure the risk to the dif pursuant to this scorecard method two scores a performance score and a loss severity score will be combined and converted to an initial base assessment rate the performance score measures an institutions financial performance and ability to withstand stress the loss severity score measures the relative magnitude of potential losses to the dif in the event of the institutions failure total scores are converted pursuant to a predetermined formula into an initial base assessment rate assessment rates range from bp to bp for large institutions premiums for associated bank are now calculated based upon the average balance of total assets minus average tangible equity as of the close of business for each day during the calendar quarter on june the fdic issued a final rule that mitigates the deposit insurance assessment effects of participating in the ppp the ppplf and mmlf pursuant to the final rule the fdic will generally remove the effect of ppp lending in calculating an institutions deposit insurance assessment the final rule also provides an offset to an institutions total assessment amount for the increase in its assessment base attributable to participation in the ppp and mmlf further on october the fdic issued a final rule to allow institutions that experienced temporary growth from participation in the ppplf andor mmlf to determine whether they are subject to the requirements of part of the fdics regulations which imposes annual audit and reporting requirements on idis with million or more in consolidated total assets for fiscal years ending in based on the consolidated assets of december the fdic has the flexibility to adopt actual rates that are higher or lower than the total base assessment rates adopted without notice and comment if certain conditions are met on september the dif reserve ratio reached percent exceeding the statutorily required minimum reserve ratio of percent ahead of the september deadline required under the doddfrank act fdic regulations provide that upon reaching the minimum surcharges on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of billion or more will cease the last quarterly surcharge was reflected in the banks december assessment invoice which covered the assessment period from july through september the banks assessment invoices have not included a quarterly surcharge since that time assessment rates which declined for all banks when the reserve ratio first surpassed percent in the third quarter of are expected to remain unchanged assessment rates are scheduled to decrease when the reserve ratio exceeds percent difinsured institutions pay a fico assessment in order to fund the interest on bonds issued in the in connection with the failures in the thrift industry the fico assessment was computed on assets as required by the doddfrank act these assessments continued until the bonds matured in september the corporations assessment rate for fdic was approximately bp for the fdic is authorized to conduct examinations of and require reporting by fdicinsured institutions it is also authorized to terminate a depository banks deposit insurance upon a finding by the fdic that the banks financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule regulation order or condition enacted or imposed by the banks regulatory agency the termination of deposit insurance for our national bank subsidiary would have a material adverse effect on our earnings operations and financial condition historically deposit insurance premiums we have paid to the fdic have been deductible for federal income tax purposes however the tax act disallows the deduction of such premium payments for banking organizations with total consolidated assets of billion or more for banks with less than billion in total consolidated assets such as ours the premium deduction is phased out based on the proportion of a banks assets exceeding billion on december the fdic issued a final rule on brokered deposits the rule aims to clarify and modernize the fdics existing regulatory framework for brokered deposits notable aspects of the rule include the establishment of brightline standards for determining whether an entity meets the statutory definition of deposit broker the identification of a number of business relationships designated exceptions to which the primary purpose exception is automatically applicable the establishment of a transparent application process for entities that seek a primary purpose exception but do not qualify as a designated exception and the clarification that third parties that have an exclusive depositplacement arrangement with only one idi are not considered a deposit broker standards for safety and soundness the federal banking agencies have adopted the interagency guidelines for establishing standards for safety and soundness the guidelines the guidelines establish certain safety and soundness standards for all depository institutions the operational and managerial standards in the guidelines relate to the following internal controls and information systems internal audit systems loan documentation credit underwriting interest rate exposure asset growth compensation fees and benefits asset quality and earnings rather than providing specific rules the guidelines set forth basic compliance considerations and guidance with respect to a depository institution failure to meet the standards in the guidelines however could result in a request by the occ to one of the nationally chartered banks to provide a written compliance plan to demonstrate its efforts to come into compliance with such guidelines failure to provide a plan or to implement a provided plan requires the appropriate federal banking agency to issue an order to the institution requiring compliance transactions with affiliates and insiders transactions between our national banking subsidiary and its related parties or any affiliate are governed by sections and of the federal reserve act an affiliate is any company or entity which controls is controlled by or is under common control with the bank in a holding company context at a minimum the parent holding company of a national bank and any companies that are controlled by such parent holding company are affiliates of the bank generally sections and i limit the extent to which an institution or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions

and elsewhere including the california consumer privacy act which became effective in january create new individual privacy rights and impose increased obligations on companies handling personal data in addition multiple states congress and regulators outside the united states are considering similar laws or regulations which could create new individual privacy rights and impose increased obligations on companies handling personal data for example on december the federal financial regulatory agencies announced a proposal that would require supervised banking organizations to promptly notify their primary federal regulator in the event of a computer security incident if adopted without substantial change the proposed rule would require banking organizations to notify their primary federal regulator promptly and not later than hours after the discovery of such incidents termed computersecurity incidents that are notification incidents federal banking agencies including the occ have adopted guidelines for establishing information security standards and cybersecurity programs for implementing safeguards under the supervision of the board of directors these guidelines along with related regulatory materials increasingly focus on risk management and processes related to information technology and the use of third parties in the provision of financial services in october the federal banking agencies issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on enhanced cybersecurity riskmanagement and resilience standards that would apply to large and interconnected banking organizations and to services provided by third parties to these firms these enhanced standards would apply only to depository institutions and depository institution holding companies with total consolidated assets of billion or more which would not currently include the corporation recent cyberattacks against banks and other financial institutions that resulted in unauthorized access to confidential customer information have prompted the federal banking regulators to issue extensive guidance on cybersecurity among other things financial institutions are expected to design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and ensure that their risk management processes address the risks posed by compromised customer credentials including security measures to authenticate customers accessing internetbased services a financial institution also should have a robust business continuity program to recover from a cyberattack and procedures for monitoring the

to explicitly include riskbased procedures for conducting ongoing customer due diligence and procedures for understanding the nature and purpose of customer relationships for the purpose of developing a customer risk profile in addition fincen recently promulgated new customer due diligence and customer identification rules that require banks to identify and verify the identity of the beneficial owners of all legal entity customers other than those that are excluded at the time a new account is opened other than accounts that are exempted which rules became effective on may in addition to complying with the bsa the bank is subject to the patriot act the patriot act is designed to deny terrorists and criminals the ability to obtain access to the united states financial system and has significant implications for depository institutions brokers dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of money the patriot act mandates that financial service companies implement additional policies and procedures and take heightened measures designed to address any or all of the following matters customer identification programs money laundering terrorist financing identifying and reporting suspicious activities and currency transactions currency crimes and cooperation between financial institutions and law enforcement authorities on december three federal banking agencies and fincen issued a joint statement clarifying the compliance procedures and reporting requirements that banks must file for customers engaged in the growth or cultivation of hemp including a clear statement that banks need not file a sar on customers engaged in the growth or cultivation of hemp in accordance with applicable laws and regulations this statement does not apply to cannabisrelated business thus the statement only pertains to customers who are lawfully growing or cultivating hemp and are not otherwise engaged in unlawful or suspicious activity further on january congress passed the national defense authorization act which enacted the most significant overhaul of the bsa and related antimoney laundering laws since the patriot act notable amendments include significant changes to the collection of beneficial ownership information and the establishment of a beneficial ownership registry which requires corporate entities generally any corporation llc or other similar entity with or fewer employees and annual gross income of million or less to report beneficial ownership information to fincen which will be maintained by fincen and made available upon request to financial institutions enhanced whistleblower provisions which provide that one or more whistleblowers who voluntarily provide original information leading to the successful enforcement of violations of the aml laws in any judicial or administrative action brought by the secretary of the treasury or the attorney general resulting in monetary sanctions exceeding million including disgorgement and interest but excluding forfeiture restitution or compensation to victims will receive not more than percent of the monetary sanctions collected and will receive increased protections increased penalties for violations of the bsa improvements to existing information sharing provisions that permit financial institutions to share information relating to sars with foreign branches subsidiaries and affiliates except those located in china russia or certain other jurisdictions for the purpose of combating illicit finance risks and expanded duties and powers of fincen many of the amendments including those with respect to beneficial ownership require the department of treasury and fincen to promulgate rules interstate branching pursuant to the doddfrank act national and statechartered banks may open an initial branch in a state other than its home state eg a host state by establishing a de novo branch at any location in such host state at which a bank chartered in such host state could establish a branch applications to establish such branches must still be filed with the appropriate primary federal regulator volcker rule the doddfrank act prohibits insured depository institutions and their holding companies from engaging in proprietary trading except in limited circumstances and prohibits them from owning equity interests in excess of three percent of tier capital in private equity and hedge funds known as the volcker rule on december five us financial regulators including the federal reserve and the occ adopted regulations implementing the volcker rule those regulations prohibit banking entities from engaging in shortterm proprietary trading for their own accounts and having certain ownership interests in and relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds which are referred to as covered funds the regulations also require each regulated entity to establish an internal compliance program that is consistent with the extent to which it engages in activities covered by the volcker rule historically this meant that the largest banking entities ie those with billion or more in assets had higher reporting requirements but in november five federal banking agencies issued a final rule revising certain aspects of the volcker rule the final rule simplifies and streamlines compliance requirements for firms that do not have significant trading activities and enhances requirements for firms that do under the rule compliance requirements will be based on the amount of assets and liabilities that a bank trades firms with significant trading activities ie those with billion or more in trading assets and liabilities will have heightened compliance obligations the rule became effective on january and banking entities were required to comply as of january although we will benefit from significantly reduced compliance obligations due to the level of our trading assets being below the billion threshold we will remain subject to the modified rules and requirements related to covered funds accordingly we expect that the revised rule will reduce some of our compliance costs but in the short term we may experience some costs in developing and implementing changes in conformance with the rule further on june the five us financial regulators issued a final rule that modifies the rules prohibition on banking entities investing in or sponsoring covered funds the new rule streamlines the covered funds portion of the rule addresses the extraterritorial treatment of certain foreign funds and permits banking entities to offer financial services and engage in other activities that do not raise concerns that the volker rule was intended to address incentive compensation policies and restrictions in july the federal banking agencies issued guidance on sound incentive compensation policies that applies to all banking organizations supervised by the agencies thereby including both the parent company and the bank pursuant to the guidance to be consistent with safety and soundness principles a banking organizations incentive compensation arrangements should provide employees with incentives that appropriately balance risk and reward be compatible with effective controls and risk management and be supported by strong corporate governance including active and effective oversight by the banking organizations board of directors monitoring methods and processes used by a banking organization should be commensurate with the size and complexity of the organization and its use of incentive compensation in accordance with the doddfrank act the federal banking agencies prohibit incentivebased compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by covered financial institutions generally institutions that have over billion in assets and are deemed to be excessive or that may lead to material losses the federal reserve will review as part of its standard riskfocused examination process the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations such as the corporation that are not large complex banking organizations these reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organizations activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements the findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination deficiencies will be incorporated into the organizations supervisory ratings which can affect the organizations ability to make acquisitions and take other actions enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related riskmanagement control or governance processes pose a risk to the organizations safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies the scope and content of the us banking regulators policies on executive compensation may continue to evolve in the near future it cannot be determined at this time whether compliance with such policies will adversely affect the corporations ability to hire retain and motivate its key employees consumer financial services regulations federal and applicable state banking laws also require us to take steps to protect consumers bank regulatory agencies are increasingly focusing attention on compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations these laws include disclosures regarding truth in lending truth in savings and funds availability to promote fairness and transparency for mortgages credit cards and other consumer financial products and services the doddfrank act established the cfpb this agency is responsible for interpreting and enforcing federal consumer financial laws as defined by the doddfrank act that among other things govern the provision of deposit accounts along with mortgage origination and servicing some federal consumer financial laws enforced by the cfpb include the equal credit opportunity act tila the truth in savings act the home mortgage disclosure act respa the fair debt collection practices act and the fair credit reporting act the cfpb is also authorized to prevent any institution under its authority from engaging in an unfair deceptive or abusive act or practice in connection with consumer financial products and services under tila as implemented by regulation z as amended by the cfpb effective january mortgage lenders are required to make a reasonable and good faith determination based on verified and documented information that a consumer applying for a mortgage loan has a reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms mortgage lenders are required to determine consumers ability to repay in one of two ways the first alternative requires the mortgage lender to consider the following eight underwriting factors when making the credit decision current or reasonably expected income or assets current employment status the monthly payment on the covered transaction the monthly payment on any simultaneous loan the monthly payment for mortgagerelated obligations current debt obligations alimony and child support the monthly dti ratio or residual income and credit history alternatively the mortgage lender can originate qms which are entitled to a presumption that the creditor making the loan satisfied the atr requirements in general a qm is a mortgage loan without negative amortization interestonly payments balloon payments or terms exceeding years in addition to be a qm the points and fees paid by a consumer cannot exceed of the total loan amount further on december the cfpb issued two final rules related to qm loans the first rule replaces the strict percent dti threshold for qm loans and provides that in addition to existing requirements a loan receives a conclusive presumption that the consumer had the ability to repay if the apr does not exceed the average prime offer rate for a comparable transaction by percentage points or more as of the date the interest rate is set further a loan receives a rebuttable presumption that the consumer had the ability to repay if the apr exceeds the average prime offer rate for a comparable transaction by percentage points or more but by less than percentage points the second rule creates a new category of seasoned qms for loans that meet certain performance requirements the rule allows a nonqm loan or a rebuttable presumption qm loan to receive a safe harbor from atr liability at the end of a seasoning period of at least months as a seasoned qm if it satisfies certain product restrictions pointsandfees limits and underwriting requirements and the loan meets the designated performance and portfolio requirements during the seasoning period the first final rule has a mandatory compliance date of july and the second final rule will apply to covered transactions for which institutions receive an application after the effective date the corporation is predominantly an originator of compliant qms additionally the cfpb has the authority to take supervisory and enforcement action against banks and other financial services companies under the agencys jurisdiction that fail to comply with federal consumer financial laws as an insured depository institution with total assets of more than billion the bank is subject to the cfpbs supervisory and enforcement authorities the doddfrank act also permits states to adopt stricter consumer protection laws and state attorneys general to enforce consumer protection rules issued by the cfpb as a result of these aspects of the doddfrank act the bank operates in a stringent consumer compliance environment therefore the bank is likely to incur additional costs related to consumer protection compliance including but not limited to potential costs associated with cfpb examinations regulatory and enforcement actions and consumeroriented litigation which is likely to increase as a result of the consumer protection provisions of the doddfrank act the cfpb has been active in bringing enforcement actions against banks and other financial institutions to enforce consumer financial laws the federal financial regulatory agencies including the occ and states attorneys general also have become increasingly active in this area with respect to institutions over which they have jurisdiction we have incurred and may in the future incur additional costs in complying with these requirements pursuant to the doddfrank act the fdic has backup enforcement authority over a depository institution holding company such as the parent company if the conduct or threatened conduct of such holding company poses a risk to the dif although such authority may not be used if the holding company is generally in sound condition and does not pose a foreseeable and material risk to the dif the doddfrank act may have a material impact on the corporations and the banks operations particularly through increased compliance costs resulting from possible future consumer and fair lending regulations see the risk factors section for a more extensive discussion of this topic other banking regulations the bank is also subject to a variety of other regulations with respect to the operation of its businesses including but not limited to the doddfrank act which among other restrictions placed limitations on the interchange fees charged for debit card transactions tila truth in savings act equal credit opportunity act electronic funds transfer act fair housing act home mortgage disclosure act fair debt collection practices act fair credit reporting act expedited funds availability regulation cc reserve requirements regulation d insider transactions regulation o privacy of consumer information regulation p margin stock loans regulation u right to financial privacy act flood disaster protection act homeowners protection act servicemembers civil relief act respa telephone consumer protection act canspam act childrens online privacy protection act and the john warner national defense authorization act further on january the occ issued a notice of proposed rulemaking amending their current rules related to ownership of real property the proposal would provide a set of general standards including an occupancy test and excess capacity standards that the occ will use to determine whether the acquisition and holding of real estate is necessary for the transaction of an institutions business the laws and regulations to which we are subject are constantly under review by congress the federal regulatory agencies and the state authorities these laws and regulations could be changed drastically in the future which could affect our profitability our ability to compete effectively or the composition of the financial services industry in which we compete government monetary policies and economic controls our earnings and growth as well as the earnings and growth of the banking industry are affected by the credit policies of monetary authorities including the federal reserve an important function of the federal reserve is to regulate the national supply of bank credit in order to combat recession and curb inflationary pressures among the instruments of monetary policy used by the federal reserve to implement these objectives are open market operations in us government securities changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits and changes in the federal reserve discount rate these instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth of bank loans investments and deposits and may also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits the monetary policies of the federal reserve authorities have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to have such an effect in the future in view of changing conditions in the national economy and in money markets as well as the effect of credit policies by monetary and fiscal authorities including the federal reserve it is difficult to predict the impact of possible future changes in interest rates deposit levels and loan demand or their effect on our business and earnings or on the financial condition of our various customers other regulatory authorities in addition to regulation supervision and examination by federal banking agencies the corporation and certain of its subsidiaries including those that engage in securities brokerage dealing and investment advisory activities are subject to other federal and applicable state securities laws and regulations and to supervision and examination by other regulatory authorities

a brokerdealer to act in the best interest of a retail customer when making a recommendation of any securities transaction or investment strategy involving securities to such customer the new rule requires us to review and possibly modify our compliance activities which is causing us to incur some additional costs in addition state laws that impose a fiduciary duty also may require monitoring
