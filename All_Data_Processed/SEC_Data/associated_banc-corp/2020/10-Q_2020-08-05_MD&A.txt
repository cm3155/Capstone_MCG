construction loans are primarily shortterm or interim loans that provide financing for the acquisition or development of commercial income properties multifamily projects or residential development both single family and condominium real estate construction loans are made to developers and project managers who are generally well known to the corporation and have prior successful project

construction lending are determined by property type and specifically address many criteria including maximum loan amounts maximum ltv requirements for preleasing and or presales minimum borrower equity and maximum loantocost currently the maximum standard for ltv is with lower limits established for certain higher risk types such as raw land that has a ltv maximum the corporations ltv guidelines are in compliance with regulatory supervisory limits in most cases for real estate construction loans the loan amounts include interest reserves which are built into the loans and sized to fund loan payments through construction and lease up and or sell out residential mortgages residential mortgage loans are primarily first lien home mortgages with a maximum loantocollateral value without credit enhancement eg private mortgage insurance of the residential mortgage portfolio is focused primarily in the corporations threestate branch footprint with approximately of the outstanding loan balances in the corporations branch footprint at june the majority of the on balance sheet residential mortgage portfolio consists of libor based hybrid adjustable rate mortgage loans with initial fixed rate terms of or years the rates on these mortgages adjust based upon the movement in the underlying index which is then added to a margin and rounded to the nearest that result is then subjected to any periodic caps to produce the borrowers interest rate for the coming term in the financial stability oversight council and financial stability board raised concerns about the reliability and robustness of libor and called for the development of alternative interest rate benchmarks the alternative reference rates committee through authority from the board of governors of the federal reserve system have selected the secured overnight financing rate as the alternative rate and developed a paced transition plan which addresses the risk that libor may not exist beyond the end of there are still many components of this plan which have not been fully decided or implemented in the industry as a result the corporation is reaching out to borrowers offering an opportunity to refinance or modify their loan to avoid any uncertainty around the libor transition performing borrowers can modify or refinance to a fixed interest rate or an adjustable rate mortgage tied to the oneyear treasury adjusted to a constant maturity of oneyear with an appropriate margin this provides the bank and borrower with greater certainty around the loan structure the corporation generally retains certain fixedrate residential real estate mortgages in its loan portfolio including retail and private banking jumbo mortgages and crarelated mortgages as part of managements historical practice of originating and servicing residential mortgage loans generally the corporations year agency conforming fixedrate residential real estate mortgage loans have been sold in the secondary market with servicing rights retained subject to managements analysis of the current interest rate environment among other market factors the corporation may choose to retain year mortgage loan production on its balance sheet during the six months ended june the corporation sold million of residential loans held for sale in order to reduce the corporations exposure to prepayment risk in the current low rate environment see section loans for additional information on loans the corporations underwriting and riskbased pricing guidelines for residential mortgage loans include minimum borrower fico and maximum ltv of the property securing the loan residential mortgage products generally are underwritten using fhlmc and fnma secondary marketing guidelines home equity home equity consists of both home equity lines of credit and closedend home equity loans the corporations credit risk monitoring guidelines for home equity is based on an ongoing review of loan delinquency status as well as a quarterly review of fico score deterioration and property devaluation the corporation does not routinely obtain appraisals on performing loans to update ltv ratios after origination however the corporation monitors the local housing markets by reviewing the various home price indices and incorporates the impact of the changing market conditions in its ongoing credit monitoring process for junior lien home equity loans the corporation is unable to track the performance of the first lien loan if it does not own or service the first lien loan however the corporation obtains a refreshed fico score on a quarterly basis and monitors this as part of its assessment of the home equity portfolio the corporations underwriting and riskbased pricing guidelines for home equity lines and loans consist of a combination of both borrower fico and the original cumulative ltv against the property securing the loan during the second quarter of in the volatile economic environment the corporation reduced its exposure by reducing its maximum ltv on home equity lines of credit from to among other changes while maintaining the minimum acceptable fico at the corporations current home equity line of credit offering is priced based on floating rate indices and generally allows years of interestonly payments followed by a 20year amortization of the outstanding balance the corporation has significantly curtailed its offerings of fixedrate closedend home equity loans the loans in the corporations portfolio generally have an original term of years with principal and interest payments required see section loans for additional information on loans other consumer other consumer consists of student loans shortterm and other personal installment loans and credit cards the corporation

government guaranteed student loans have been placed on an administrative forbearance through september credit risk for nongovernment guaranteed student loans shortterm personal installment loans and credit cards is influenced by general economic conditions the characteristics of individual borrowers and the nature of the loan collateral risks of loss are generally on smaller average balances per loan spread over many borrowers once charged off there is usually less opportunity for recovery of these smaller consumer loans credit risk is primarily controlled by reviewing the creditworthiness of the borrowers monitoring payment histories and taking appropriate collateral and guarantee positions the student loan portfolio is in runoff and no new student loans are being originated covid19

level of risk in the loan portfolio and in determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses potential problem loans are generally defined by management to include loans rated as substandard by management but that are not individually evaluated ie nonaccrual loans and accruing tdrs however there are circumstances present to create doubt as to the ability of the borrower to comply with present repayment terms the decision of management to include performing loans in potential problem loans does not necessarily mean that the corporation expects losses to occur but that management recognizes a higher degree of risk associated with these loans oreo management actively seeks to ensure oreo properties held are monitored to minimize the corporations risk of loss other

potential credit losses the corporation utilized the moodys baseline forecast for june in the allowance model the forecast is applied over a year reasonable and supportable period with immediate reversion to historical long run losses assessing these factors involves significant judgment because each of the criteria used is subject to change the acll is not necessarily indicative of the trend of future credit losses on loans in any particular segment therefore management considers the acll a critical accounting policy see section critical accounting policies for additional information on

provides information on loan growth and period end loan composition table provides additional information regarding npas and table and table provide additional information regarding activity in the

estimate is established for specifically identified commercial and consumer loans determined by the corporation to be individually evaluated using discounted cash flows estimated fair value of underlying collateral and or other data available second management allocates the acll with loss factors by loan segment loans are segmented for criticized loan pools by loan type as well as for noncriticized loan pools by loan type primarily based on historical loss rates after considering loan type historical loss and delinquency experience credit quality and industry classifications loans that have been criticized are considered to have a higher risk of default than noncriticized loans as circumstances were present to support the lower loan grade warranting higher loss factors the loss factors applied in the methodology are periodically reevaluated and adjusted to reflect changes in historical loss levels or other risks additionally management allocates acll to absorb losses that may not be provided for by the other components due to qualitative factors evaluated by management such as limitations within the credit risk grading process known current economic or business conditions that may not yet show in trends industry or other concentrations with current issues that impose higher inherent risks than are reflected in the loss factors and other relevant

risk market risk and interest rate risk are managed centrally market risk is the potential for loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of fixed income securities equity securities other earning assets and derivative financial instruments as a result of changes in interest rates or other factors interest rate risk is the potential for reduced net interest income resulting from adverse changes in the level of interest rates as a financial institution that engages in transactions involving an array of financial products the corporation is exposed to both market risk and interest rate risk in addition to market risk interest rate risk is measured and managed through a number of methods the corporation uses financial modeling simulation techniques that measure the sensitivity of future earnings due to changing rate environments to measure interest rate risk policies established by the corporations alco and approved by the board of directors are intended to limit these risks the board has delegated daytoday responsibility for managing market and interest rate risk to alco the primary objectives of market risk management is to minimize any adverse effect that changes in market risk factors may have on net interest income and to offset the risk of price changes for certain assets recorded at fair value interest rate risk the primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk within policy limits approved by the board of directors these limits and guidelines reflect the corporations risk appetite for interest rate risk over both shortterm and longterm horizons no interest rate limit breaches occurred during the first six months of the major sources of the corporations nontrading interest rate risk are timing differences in the maturity and repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities changes in the shape of the yield curve and the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options we measure these risks and their impact by identifying and quantifying exposures through the use of sophisticated simulation and valuation models which are employed by management to understand nii at risk interest rate sensitive ear and mve at risk the corporations interest rate risk profile is such that a higher or steeper yield curve adds to income while a flatter yield curve is relatively neutral and a lower or inverted yield curve generally has a negative impact on earnings the corporations ear profile is asset sensitive at june for further discussion of the corporations interest rate risk and corresponding key assumptions see the interest rate risk section of managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the corporations annual report on form 10k the sensitivity analysis included below is measured as a percentage change in nii and ear due to gradual moves in benchmark interest rates from a baseline scenario over months we evaluate the sensitivity using a dynamic forecast incorporating expected growth in the balance sheet and a static forecast where the current balance sheet is held constant while a gradual shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under a probable scenario an instantaneous shift in interest rates would have a much more significant impact table estimated change in rate

interest rates at june the mve profile indicates an increase in net balance sheet value due to instantaneous upward changes in rates table market value of equity sensitivity june december instantaneous rate change bp increase in interest rates bp increase in interest rates since mve measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments the change

goodwill impairment assessment msrs valuation and income taxes a discussion of these policies can be found in the critical accounting policies section in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the corporations annual report on form 10k there has been one change in the corporations application of critical accounting policies since december driven by the adoption of asu allowance for credit losses on loans managements evaluation process used to determine the appropriateness of the acll is subject to the use of estimates assumptions and judgments the evaluation process combines many factors managements ongoing review and grading of the loan portfolio using a dual risk rating system leveraging probability of default and loss given default consideration of historical loan loss and delinquency experience trends in past due and nonaccrual loans risk characteristics of the various classifications of loans concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries existing economic conditions and forecasts the fair value of underlying collateral and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect future credit losses because current economic conditions and forecasts can change and future events are inherently difficult to predict the anticipated amount of estimated credit losses on loans and therefore the appropriateness of the acll could change significantly the corporation uses moodys baseline economic forecast within its model as an integral part of their examination process various regulatory agencies also review the acll such agencies may require additions to the acll or may require that certain loan balances be charged off or downgraded into criticized loan categories when their credit evaluations differ from those of management based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination the corporation believes the level of the acll is appropriate see note summary of significant accounting policies and note loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements as well as the allowance for credit losses section
