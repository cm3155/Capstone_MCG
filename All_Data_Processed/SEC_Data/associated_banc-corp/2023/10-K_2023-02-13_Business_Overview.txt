index best place to work for disability inclusion competition the financial services industry is highly competitive we compete for loans deposits and financial services in all of our principal markets we compete directly with other bank and nonbank institutions located within our markets internetbased banks outofmarket banks and bank holding companies that advertise or otherwise serve our markets money market funds and other mutual funds brokerage houses and various other financial institutions additionally we compete with insurance companies leasing companies regulated small loan companies credit unions governmental agencies and commercial entities offering financial services products including nonbank lenders and financial technology companies competition involves among other things efforts to retain current customers and to obtain new loans and deposits the scope and types of services offered interest rates paid on deposits and charged on loans as well as other aspects of banking we also face direct competition from subsidiaries of bank holding companies that have far greater assets and resources than ours supervision and regulation overview the corporation and its banking and nonbanking subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation and oversight both at the federal and state levels the following is an overview of the statutory and regulatory framework that affects the business of the corporation and our subsidiaries bhc act requirements as a registered bank holding company under the bhc act we are regulated supervised and examined by the federal reserve in connection with applicable requirements bank holding companies file periodic reports and other information with the federal reserve the bhc act also governs the activities that are permissible for bank holding companies and their affiliates and permits the federal reserve in certain circumstances to issue cease and desist orders and other enforcement actions against bank holding companies and their nonbanking affiliates to correct and curtail unsafe or unsound banking practices under the doddfrank act and longstanding federal reserve policy bank holding companies are required to act as a source of financial strength to each of their banking subsidiaries pursuant to which such holding company may be required to commit financial resources to support such subsidiaries in circumstances when absent such requirements they might not otherwise do so the bhc act further regulates holding company activities including requirements and limitations relating to capital transactions with officers directors and affiliates securities issuances dividend payments interaffiliate liabilities extensions of credit and expansion through mergers and acquisitions the bhc act allows certain qualifying bank holding companies that elect treatment as financial holding companies to engage in activities that are financial in nature and that explicitly include the underwriting and sale of insurance the parent company thus far has not elected to be treated as a financial holding company bank holding companies that have not elected such treatment generally must limit their activities to banking activities and activities that are closely related to banking in the federal reserve finalized a rule that simplifies and increases transparency of its rules for determining when one company controls another company for purposes of the bhc act the federal reserve staff has since published interpretive guidance regarding the final rule and related regulatory control matters the amended control rule thus far has had and will likely continue to have a meaningful impact on control determinations related to investments in banks and bank holding companies and investments by bank holding companies in nonbank companies regulation of associated bank and trust company subsidiaries associated bank and our nationallychartered trust company subsidiary are regulated supervised and examined by the occ the occ has primary supervisory and regulatory authority over the operations of associated bank and the corporations trust company subsidiary as part of this authority associated bank and our trust company subsidiary are required to file periodic reports with the occ and are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the occ to support its supervisory function the occ has the authority to assess and charge fees on all national banks according to a set fee schedule on december the occ published its assessment rates for the calendar year the general assessment schedule for includes reductions in assessment rates of percent for all banks on their first million in total balance sheet assets and percent for all banks on balance sheet assets above million and up to billion associated bank our only subsidiary that accepts insured deposits is also subject to examination by the fdic we are subject to the enforcement and rulemaking authority of the cfpb regarding consumer financial products the cfpb has the authority to create and enforce consumer protection rules and regulations and has the power to examine us for compliance with such rules and regulations the cfpb also has the authority to prohibit unfair deceptive or abusive acts and practices the cfpb has examination and enforcement authority over all banks with more than billion in assets such as associated bank legislative and regulatory responses to the covid19 pandemic the covid19 pandemic has caused extensive disruptions to the global economy to businesses and to the lives of individuals throughout the world congress took significant action to address these disruptions including by passing the cares act a trillion economic stimulus bill and the economic aid act there have also been a number of regulatory actions intended to help mitigate the adverse economic impact of the covid19 pandemic on borrowers including several mandates from the bank regulatory agencies requiring financial institutions to work constructively with borrowers affected by the pandemic many of these actions were temporary and have expired however certain aspects of the regulatory framework that were modified as a result of the pandemic remain in effect for example in response to the pandemic the federal reserve implemented an interim final rule allowing banks to suspend enforcement of the sixtransfer limit on convenient transfers from savings deposits under regulation d in order to permit customers to make an unlimited number of convenient transfers and withdrawals amid pandemicrelated financial disruptions and uncertainty this amendment since has been adopted on a permanent basis banking acquisitions we are required to obtain prior federal reserve approval before acquiring more than percent of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company bank or savings association in addition the prior approval of the occ is required for a national bank to merge with another bank or purchase the assets or assume the deposits of another bank in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition federal bank regulators will consider among other factors the effect of the acquisition on competition the public benefits expected to be received from the acquisition the projected capital ratios and levels on a postacquisition basis and the acquiring institutions record of addressing the credit needs of the communities it serves including the needs of lmi neighborhoods consistent with the safe and sound operation of the bank under the cra in july of president biden issued an executive order on promoting competition in the american economy among other initiatives the executive order encouraged the federal banking agencies to review their current merger oversight practices under the bhc act and the bank merger act and adopt a plan for revitalization of such practices in response on march the fdic issued a request for information on the effectiveness of the existing framework for evaluating bank mergers and acquisitions under the fdi act with particular focus on the increase in asset concentration among banking organizations with more than billion in total assets further the ftc and doj announced in january a joint public inquiry aimed at strengthening the agencies enforcement against mergers that would violate the federal antitrust laws as a result the ftc and doj are believed to be more closely evaluating proposed mergers and acquisitions including within the financial services sector that have the potential to limit competition the timing and prospects for the formal adoption by the federal banking agencies of modified regulatory standards for the evaluation of bank mergers and acquisitions is uncertain at this time see the risk factors section for a more extensive discussion of this topic banking subsidiary dividends the parent company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank and other nonbanking subsidiaries a substantial portion of our cash flow comes from dividends paid to us by associated bank the occs prior approval of the payment of dividends by associated bank to the parent company is required only if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year exceeds the sum of the banks retained net income for that year and its retained net income for the preceding two calendar years less any required transfers to surplus federal law also prohibits national banks from paying dividends that would be greater than the banks undivided profits after deducting statutory bad debt in excess of the banks allowance for loan losses in addition under the fdicia an idi such as the bank is prohibited from making capital distributions including the payment of dividends if after making such distribution the institution would become undercapitalized as such term is used in the fdicia holding company dividends in addition we and the bank are subject to various general regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends including requirements to maintain adequate capital above regulatory minimums the appropriate federal regulatory authority is authorized to determine under certain circumstances relating to the financial condition of a bank or bank holding company that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof under the doddfrank act and the requirements of the federal reserve the parent company as a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial strength to the bank and to commit resources to support the bank in addition consistent with its source of strength policy the federal reserve has stated that as a matter of prudent banking a bank holding company should not maintain a level of cash dividends to its shareholders that places undue pressure on the capital of its bank subsidiaries or that can be funded only through additional borrowings or other arrangements that may undermine the bank holding companys ability to serve as a source of strength the appropriate federal regulatory authorities have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a banks capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice and that banking organizations should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings capital requirements we are subject to various regulatory capital requirements both at the parent company and at the bank level administered by the federal reserve and the occ respectively failure to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could have an adverse material effect on our financial condition and results of operations under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action described below we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets liabilities and certain offbalance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting policies our capital amounts and classification are also subject to judgments by the regulators regarding qualitative components risk weightings and other factors we have consistently maintained regulatory capital ratios at or above the well capitalized standards the federal reserve the occ and the fdic have adopted riskbased capital regulations implementing certain provisions of the doddfrank act and basel iii the agencies previous capital regulations were amended in to strengthen the components of regulatory capital increase riskbased capital requirements and make selected changes to the calculation of riskweighted assets in general subject to certain exceptions as discussed further below minimum capital standards established under the riskbased capital regulations include a cet1 capital to riskweighted assets ratio of percent a tier capital to riskweighted assets ratio of percent a total capital to riskweighted assets ratio of percent and a tier capital to adjusted average total assets leverage ratio of percent in determining the amount of riskweighted assets for purposes of calculating riskbased capital ratios all assets including certain offbalance sheet assets for example recourse obligations direct credit substitutes and residual interests are multiplied by a riskweight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk cet1 capital is generally defined as common shareholders equity and retained earnings tier capital is generally defined as cet1 and additional tier capital additional tier capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries total capital includes tier capital cet1 capital plus additional tier capital and tier capital tier capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus meeting specified requirements and may include cumulative preferred stock and longterm perpetual preferred stock mandatory convertible securities intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt also included in tier capital is the allowance for credit losses limited to a maximum of percent of riskweighted assets calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations in assessing an institutions capital adequacy the occ takes into consideration not only these numeric factors but qualitative factors as well and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where deemed necessary in addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements the capital regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a capital conservation buffer consisting of percent of cet1 capital to riskweighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum riskbased capital requirements through subsequent rulemaking the federal banking agencies provided certain forms of relief to banking organizations that are not subject to the capital regulations advanced approaches such as the corporation for instance nonadvanced approaches institutions are subject to simpler regulatory capital requirements for msas certain dtas arising from temporary differences investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions and requirements for the amount of capital issued by a consolidated subsidiary of a banking organization and held by third parties sometimes referred to as a minority interest that is includable in regulatory capital in addition certain general requirements of the capital regulations have been eliminated in respect of nonadvanced approaches institutions including i the capital rules percent cet capital deduction threshold that applies individually to msas temporary difference dtas and significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of common stock ii the aggregate percent cet1 capital deduction threshold that subsequently applies on a collective basis across such items iii the percent cet1 capital deduction threshold for nonsignificant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions and iv the deduction treatment for significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions not in the form of common stock accordingly banking organizations not subject to the advanced approaches capital rule may deduct from cet1 capital any amount of msas temporary difference dtas and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions that individually exceeds percent of cet1 capital the basel committee on banking supervision published the last version of the basel iii accord in generally referred to as basel iv the basel committee stated that a key objective of the revisions incorporated into the framework is to reduce excessive variability of riskweighted assets which will be accomplished by enhancing the robustness and risk sensitivity of the standardized approaches for credit risk and operational risk this will facilitate the comparability of banks capital ratios constraining the use of internally modeled approaches and complementing the riskweighted capital ratio with a finalized leverage ratio and a revised and robust capital floor leadership of the federal reserve occ and fdic who are tasked with implementing basel iv supported the revisions under the current us capital rules operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to advanced approaches institutions and not to the corporation the impact of basel iv on us will depend on the manner in which it is implemented by the federal banking agencies we continue to exceed all capital requirements necessary to be deemed wellcapitalized for all regulatory purposes under the capital regulations for further detail on capital and capital ratios see discussion under the liquidity and capital sections under part ii item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and under part ii item financial statements and supplementary data note regulatory matters of the notes to consolidated financial statements current expected credit loss treatment in june the fasb issued an accounting standard update financial instrumentscredit losses topic measurement of credit losses on financial instruments which replaced the incurred loss model for recognizing credit losses with an expected loss model referred to as the cecl model under the cecl model we are required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost such as loans held for investment and htm securities at the net amount expected to be collected the measurement of expected credit losses is to be based on information about past events including historical experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount on december the federal banking agencies approved a final rule modifying their regulatory capital rules and providing an option to phase in over a period of three years the dayone regulatory capital effects of the cecl model the final rule also revises the agencies other rules to reflect the update to the accounting standards the final rule took effect april however on august the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule that provided institutions that had adopted the cecl accounting standard in with the option to mitigate the estimated capital effects of cecl for two years followed by a threeyear transition period taken together these measures offer institutions a transition period of up to five years the corporation elected to utilize the capital transition relief as permitted under applicable regulations as a result the threeyear phaseout period described above commenced in capital planning and stress testing requirements as part of the regulatory relief provided by the economic growth act the asset threshold requiring idis to conduct and report to their primary federal bank regulators annual companyrun stress tests as well as to comply with leverage limits liquidity requirements and resolution planning requirements was raised from billion to billion in total consolidated assets and the stress testing requirement was made periodic rather than annual as a result of the legislation and related occ rulemaking thereunder the bank is no longer subject to doddfrank act stress testing requirements the economic growth act also provided that bank holding companies under billion in assets were no longer subject to stress testing requirements the amended regulations also provide the federal reserve with discretion to subject bank holding companies with more than billion in total assets to enhanced supervision in addition section of the economic growth act and its implementing regulation prohibit the federal banking agencies from requiring the bank to assign a heightened risk weight to certain hvcre adc loans as previously required under the basel iii capital rules notwithstanding these regulatory amendments the federal banking agencies indicated through interagency guidance that the capital planning and risk management practices of institutions with total assets less than billion would continue to be reviewed through the regular supervisory process although the corporation will continue to monitor and stress test its capital consistent with the safety and soundness expectations of the federal regulators the corporation no longer publishes stress testing results as a result of the legislative and regulatory amendments enforcement powers of the federal banking agencies prompt corrective action the federal reserve the occ and the cfpb have extensive supervisory authority over their regulated institutions including among other things the power to compel higher reserves the ability to assess civil money penalties the ability to issue ceaseanddesist or removal orders and the ability to initiate injunctive actions in general these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations or for unsafe or unsound banking practices other actions or inactions by the parent company may provide the basis for enforcement action including misleading or untimely reports federal banking regulators are authorized and under certain circumstances required to take certain actions against banks that fail to meet their capital requirements the federal banking agencies have additional enforcement authority with respect to undercapitalized depository institutions well capitalized institutions may generally operate without supervisory restriction adequately capitalized institutions cannot normally pay dividends or make any capital contributions that would leave them undercapitalized they cannot pay a management fee to a controlling person if after paying the fee they would be undercapitalized and they cannot accept renew or roll over any brokered deposit unless the bank has applied for and been granted a waiver by the fdic the federal banking agencies are required to take action to restrict the activities of an undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized idi any such bank must submit a capital restoration plan that is guaranteed by the parent holding company until such plan is approved it may not increase its assets acquire another institution establish a branch or engage in any new activities and generally may not make capital distributions in certain situations a federal banking agency may reclassify a wellcapitalized institution as adequately capitalized and may require an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution to comply with supervisory actions as if the institution were in the next lower category institutions must file a capital restoration plan with the occ within days of the date it receives a notice from the occ that it is undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized compliance with a capital restoration plan must be guaranteed by a parent holding company in addition the occ is permitted to take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions including but not limited to the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors finally bank regulatory agencies have the ability to impose higher than normal capital requirements known as individual minimum capital requirements for institutions with a highrisk profile at december the bank satisfied the capital requirements necessary to be deemed well capitalized in the event of a change to this status the imposition of any of the measures described above could have a material adverse effect on the corporation and on its profitability and operations the corporations shareholders do not have preemptive rights and therefore if the corporation is directed by the occ or the fdic to issue additional shares of common stock such issuance may result in dilution in shareholders percentage of ownership of the corporation deposit insurance premiums associated bank is a member of the fdic and pays an insurance premium to the fdic based upon its assessment rates on a quarterly basis deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the fdic and such insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government under the doddfrank act a permanent increase in deposit insurance was authorized to per depositor per idi for each account ownership category the doddfrank act also set the minimum dif reserve ratio at percent of estimated insured deposits the fdic was required to attain this ratio by september the doddfrank act also required the fdic to define the deposit insurance assessment base for an idi as an amount equal to the institutions average consolidated total assets during the assessment period minus average tangible equity the assessment rate schedule for larger institutions like associated bank ie institutions with at least billion in assets differentiates between such large institutions by use of a scorecard that combines an institutions camels ratings with certain forwardlooking financial information to measure the risk to the dif pursuant to this scorecard method two scores a performance score and a loss severity score will be combined and converted to an initial base assessment rate the performance score measures an institutions financial performance and ability to withstand stress the loss severity score measures the relative magnitude of potential losses to the dif in the event of the institutions failure total scores are converted pursuant to a predetermined formula into an initial base assessment rate assessment rates range from bp to bp for large institutions the fdic has the flexibility to adopt actual rates that are higher or lower than the total base assessment rates adopted without notice and comment if certain conditions are met on october the fdic adopted a final rule applicable to all idis to increase base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules uniformly by bp beginning in the first quarterly assessment period of the increase is being instituted to account for extraordinary growth in insured deposits during the first and second quarters of which caused a substantial decrease in the dif reserve ratio the fdic has indicated that the new assessment rate schedules will remain in effect until the dif reserve ratio meets or exceeds percent difinsured institutions pay a fico assessment in order to fund the interest on bonds issued in the in connection with the failures in the thrift industry the fico assessment was computed on assets as required by the doddfrank act these assessments continued until the bonds matured in september the corporations assessment rate for fdic was approximately bp for the fdic is authorized to conduct examinations of and require reporting by fdicinsured institutions it is also authorized to terminate a depository banks deposit insurance upon a finding by the fdic that the banks financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule regulation order or condition enacted or imposed by the banks regulatory agency the termination of deposit insurance for our national bank subsidiary would have a material adverse effect on our earnings operations and financial condition historically deposit insurance premiums we have paid to the fdic have been deductible for federal income tax purposes however the tax act disallows the deduction of such premium payments for banking organizations with total consolidated assets of billion or more for banks with less than billion in total consolidated assets such as ours the premium deduction is phased out based on the proportion of a banks assets exceeding billion brokered deposits section of the fdi act and fdic regulations thereunder limit the ability of an idi such as the bank to accept renew or roll over brokered deposits unless the institution is wellcapitalized under the prompt corrective action framework described above or unless it is adequately capitalized and obtains a waiver from the fdic in addition less than wellcapitalized banks are subject to restrictions on the interest rates they may pay on deposits the characterization of deposits as brokered may result in the imposition of higher deposit assessments on such deposits as mandated by the economic growth act the fdic adopted a final rule in february to include a limited exception for reciprocal deposits for fdicidis that are well rated and well capitalized or adequately capitalized and have obtained a waiver from the fdic as mentioned above under the limited exception qualified fdicidis like the bank are able to except from treatment as brokered deposits up to billion or percent of the institutions total liabilities in reciprocal deposits which is defined as deposits received by a financial institution through a deposit placement network with the same maturity if any and in the same aggregate amount as deposits placed by the institution in other network member banks in december of the fdic issued a final rule amending its brokered deposits regulation the final rule sought to clarify and modernize the fdics regulatory framework for brokered deposits notable aspects of the rule include the establishment of brightline standards for determining whether an entity meets the statutory definition of deposit broker the identification of a number of business relationships in which the agent of nominee is automatically not deemed to be a deposit broker because their primary purpose is not the placement of funds with depository institutions the primary purpose exception the establishment of a more transparent application process for entities that seek the primary purpose exception but do not qualify as one of the identified business relationships to which the exception is automatically applicable and the clarification that third parties that have an exclusive depositplacement arrangement with only one idi are not considered a deposit broker full compliance with the amended brokered deposits regulation was required by january the fdic staff continues to implement the final rule through the issuance of interpretative guidance and other administrative actions standards for safety and soundness the federal banking agencies have adopted the interagency guidelines for establishing standards for safety and soundness the guidelines the guidelines establish certain safety and soundness standards for all depository institutions the operational and managerial standards in the guidelines relate to the following internal controls and information systems internal audit systems loan documentation credit underwriting interest rate exposure asset growth compensation fees and benefits asset quality and earnings rather than providing specific rules the guidelines set forth basic compliance considerations and guidance with respect to a depository institution failure to meet the standards in the guidelines however could result in a request by the occ to one of the nationally chartered banks to provide a written compliance plan to demonstrate its efforts to come into compliance with such guidelines failure to provide a plan or to implement a provided plan requires the appropriate federal banking agency to issue an order to the institution requiring compliance transactions with affiliates and insiders transactions between our national banking subsidiary and its related parties or any affiliate are governed by sections and of the federal reserve act an affiliate is any company or entity which controls is controlled by or is under common control with the bank in a holding company context at a minimum the parent holding company of a national bank and any companies that are controlled by such parent holding company are affiliates of the bank generally sections and i limit the extent to which an institution or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate to an amount equal to percent of such institutions capital stock and surplus and contain an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to percent of such capital stock and surplus and ii require that all such transactions be on terms substantially the same or at least as favorable to the institution or subsidiary as those provided to a nonaffiliate the term covered transaction includes the making of loans purchase of assets issuance of a guarantee and similar types of transactions certain types of covered transactions must be collateralized according to a schedule set forth in the statute based on the type of collateral certain transactions with our directors officers or controlling persons are also subject to conflicts of interest regulations among other things these regulations require that loans to such persons and their related interests be made on terms substantially the same as for loans to unaffiliated individuals and must not create an abnormal risk of repayment or other unfavorable features for the financial institution see note loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item financial statements and supplementary data for additional information on loans to related parties community reinvestment act requirements associated bank is subject to periodic cra reviews by the occ the cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions and does not limit the ability of such institutions to develop products and services believed bestsuited for a particular community an institutions cra assessment may be used by its regulators in their evaluation of certain applications including a merger acquisition or the establishment of a branch office an unsatisfactory rating may be used as the basis for denial of such an application the bank received a satisfactory cra rating in its most recent evaluation on may the federal banking agencies issued a joint notice of proposed rulemaking to revise the regulations implementing the cra under the proposed rule the agencies would evaluate bank performance across the varied activities they conduct and the communities in which they operate and tailor cra evaluations and data collection based on bank size and type further the agencies would also emphasize smaller value loans and investments that may have a greater impact on and be more responsive to the needs of lmi persons and would update cra assessment areas to include activities associated with online and mobile banking branchless banking and hybrid models in addition the proposed rule would establish a metricsbased approach to cra evaluations of retail lending and community development financing activities including through the establishment of public benchmarks and would clarify eligible cra activities such as affordable housing that are focused on lmi underserved and rural communities the prospects and timing for the adoption by the agencies of a final rule are not certain at this time privacy data protection and cybersecurity we are subject to a number of us federal state local and foreign laws and regulations relating to consumer privacy and data protection under privacy protection provisions of the grammleachbliley act of and its implementing regulations and guidance we are limited in our ability to disclose certain nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties financial institutions such as the bank are required by statute and regulation to notify consumers of their privacy policies and practices and in some circumstances allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party in addition such financial institutions must appropriately safeguard their customers nonpublic personal information consumers must be notified in the event of a data breach under applicable state laws the changing privacy laws in the united states europe and elsewhere including the california consumer privacy act which became effective in january and was amended in november by a ballot initiative titled the cpra create new individual privacy rights and impose increased obligations on companies handling personal data the cpra which took effect on january also established the california privacy protection agency which is responsible for issuing regulations to further implement the cpra in addition multiple states congress and regulators within and outside of the united states are considering similar laws or regulations which could create new individual privacy rights and impose increased obligations on companies handling personal data specifically including financial institutions for example in november of the federal banking agencies published a final rule that will impose upon banking organizations and their service providers new notification requirements for significant cybersecurity incidents specifically the final rule requires banking organizations to notify their primary federal regulator as soon as possible and no later than hours after the discovery of a computersecurity incident that rises to the level of a notification incident within the meaning attributed to those terms by the final rule banks service providers are required under the final rule to notify any affected bank to or on behalf of which the service provider provides services as soon as possible after determining that it has experienced an incident that materially disrupts or degrades or is reasonably likely to materially disrupt or degrade covered services provided to such bank for as much as four hours the final rule took effect on april and full compliance was required as of may the federal banking agencies including the occ have adopted guidelines for establishing information security standards and cybersecurity programs for implementing safeguards under the supervision of the board of directors these guidelines along with related regulatory materials increasingly focus on risk management and processes related to information technology and the use of third parties in the provision of financial services moreover recent cyberattacks against banks and other financial institutions that resulted in unauthorized access to confidential customer information have prompted the federal banking regulators to issue more extensive guidance on cybersecurity risk management among other things financial institutions are expected to design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and ensure that their risk management processes address the risks posed by compromised customer credentials including security measures to authenticate customers accessing internetbased services a financial institution also should have a robust business continuity program to recover from a cyberattack and procedures for monitoring the security of thirdparty service providers that may have access to nonpublic data at the institution during the corporation did not discover any material cybersecurity incidents bank secrecy act antimoney laundering the bsa which is intended to require financial institutions to develop policies procedures and practices to prevent and deter money laundering mandates that every national bank have a written boardapproved program that is reasonably designed to assure and monitor compliance with the bsa the program must at a minimum provide for a system of internal controls to assure ongoing compliance provide for independent testing for compliance designate an individual responsible for coordinating and monitoring daytoday compliance and provide training for appropriate personnel in addition national banks are required to adopt a customer identification program as part of their bsa compliance program national banks are also required to file sars when they detect certain known or suspected violations of federal law or suspicious transactions related to a money laundering activity or a violation of the bsa the regulations implementing the bsa require financial institutions to established riskbased procedures for conducting ongoing customer due diligence and procedures for understanding the nature and purpose of customer relationships for the purpose of developing a customer risk profile in addition fincen has promulgated customer due diligence and customer identification rules that require banks to identify and verify the identity of the beneficial owners of all legal entity customers other than those that are excluded at the time a new account is opened other than accounts that are exempted in addition to complying with the bsa the bank is subject to the patriot act the patriot act is designed to deny terrorists and criminals the ability to obtain access to the united states financial system and has significant implications for depository institutions brokers dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of money the patriot act mandates that financial service companies implement additional policies and procedures and take heightened measures designed to address any or all of the following matters customer identification programs money laundering terrorist financing identifying and reporting suspicious activities and currency transactions currency crimes and cooperation between financial institutions and law enforcement authorities on december three federal banking agencies and fincen issued a joint statement clarifying the compliance procedures and reporting requirements that banks must file for customers engaged in the growth or cultivation of hemp including a clear statement that banks need not file a sar on customers engaged in the growth or cultivation of hemp in accordance with applicable laws and regulations this statement does not apply to cannabisrelated business thus the statement only pertains to customers who are lawfully growing or cultivating hemp and are not otherwise engaged in unlawful or suspicious activity further on january congress passed the ndaa which enacted the most significant overhaul of the bsa and related aml laws since the patriot act notable amendments include significant changes to the collection of beneficial ownership information and the establishment of a beneficial ownership registry which requires corporate entities generally any corporation llc or other similar entity with or fewer employees and annual gross income of million or less to report beneficial ownership information to fincen which will be maintained by fincen and made available upon request to financial institutions enhanced whistleblower provisions which provide that one or more whistleblowers who voluntarily provide original information leading to the successful enforcement of violations of the aml laws in any judicial or administrative action brought by the secretary of the treasury or the attorney general resulting in monetary sanctions exceeding million including disgorgement and interest but excluding forfeiture restitution or compensation to victims will receive not more than percent of the monetary sanctions collected and will receive increased protections increased penalties for violations of the bsa improvements to existing information sharing provisions that permit financial institutions to share information relating to sars with foreign branches subsidiaries and affiliates except those located in china russia or certain other jurisdictions for the purpose of combating illicit finance risks and expanded duties and powers of fincen many of the amendments require the department of treasury and fincen to promulgate rules on september fincen issued a final regulation implementing the bsa amendments included in the ndaa with respect to beneficial ownership interstate branching pursuant to the doddfrank act national and statechartered banks may open an initial branch in a state other than its home state eg a host state by establishing a de novo branch at any location in such host state at which a bank chartered in such host state could establish a branch applications to establish such branches must still be filed with the appropriate primary federal regulator volcker rule the doddfrank act prohibits idis and their holding companies from engaging in proprietary trading except in limited circumstances and prohibits them from owning equity interests in excess of three percent of tier capital in private equity and hedge funds known as the volcker rule five us financial regulators with jurisdiction over the volcker rule including the federal reserve and the occ have adopted implementing regulations those regulations prohibit banking entities from engaging in shortterm proprietary trading for their own accounts and having certain ownership interests in and relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds which are referred to as covered funds the regulations also require each regulated entity to establish an internal compliance program that is consistent with the extent to which it engages in activities covered by the volcker rule historically this meant that the largest banking entities ie those with billion or more in assets had higher reporting requirements but in november the agencies issued a final rule revising certain aspects of the volcker rule the final rule simplified and streamlined compliance requirements for firms that do not have significant trading activities and enhanced requirements for firms that do under the rule compliance requirements are based on the amount of assets and liabilities that a bank trades firms with significant trading activities ie those with billion or more in trading assets and liabilities have heightened compliance obligations although we benefit from significantly reduced compliance obligations due to the level of our trading assets being below the billion threshold as a result of the final rule we remain subject to the modified rules and requirements related to covered funds further in june of the five agencies referenced above issued a final rule that modified the volcker rules prohibition on banking entities investing in or sponsoring covered funds the final rule streamlined the covered funds portion of the rule addressed the extraterritorial treatment of certain foreign funds and permits banking entities to offer financial services and engage in other activities that do not raise concerns that the volcker rule was intended to address incentive compensation policies and restrictions the federal banking agencies have issued guidance on sound incentive compensation policies that applies to all banking organizations supervised by the agencies thereby including both the parent company and the bank pursuant to the guidance to be consistent with safety and soundness principles a banking organizations incentive compensation arrangements should provide employees with incentives that appropriately balance risk and reward be compatible with effective controls and risk management and be supported by strong corporate governance including active and effective oversight by the banking organizations board of directors monitoring methods and processes used by a banking organization should be commensurate with the size and complexity of the organization and its use of incentive compensation the doddfrank act required the federal banking agencies and the sec to establish joint regulations or guidelines for specified regulated entities such as us having at least billion in total assets to prohibit incentivebased payment arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by providing an executive officer employee director or principal shareholder with excessive compensation fees or benefits or that could lead to material financial loss to the entity in addition these regulators must establish regulations or guidelines requiring enhanced disclosure to regulators of incentivebased compensation arrangements in october of the sec adopted a final regulation implementing the incentivebased recovery or clawback provisions of the doddfrank act the final regulation directs stock exchanges to require listed companies to implement clawback policies to recover incentivebased compensation paid to current or former executive officers in the event of material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws and to disclose their clawback policies and their actions under those policies it is anticipated that most sec registrants will be given until late or early to adopt and implement the policies required by the final regulation the federal reserve will review as part of its standard riskfocused examination process the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations such as the corporation that are not large complex banking organizations these reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organizations activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements the findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination deficiencies will be incorporated into the organizations supervisory ratings which can affect the organizations ability to make acquisitions and take other actions enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related riskmanagement control or governance processes pose a risk to the organizations safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies the scope and content of the us banking regulators policies on executive compensation may continue to evolve in the near future it cannot be determined at this time whether compliance with such policies will adversely affect the corporations ability to hire retain and motivate its key employees consumer financial services regulations federal and applicable state banking laws also require us to take steps to protect consumers bank regulatory agencies are increasingly focusing attention on compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations these laws include disclosures regarding truth in lending truth in savings and funds availability to promote fairness and transparency for mortgages credit cards and other consumer financial products and services the doddfrank act established the cfpb this agency is responsible for interpreting and enforcing federal consumer financial laws as defined by the doddfrank act that among other things govern the provision of deposit accounts along with mortgage origination and servicing some federal consumer financial laws enforced by the cfpb include the equal credit opportunity act tila the truth in savings act the home mortgage disclosure act respa the fair debt collection practices act and the fair credit reporting act the cfpb is also authorized to prevent any institution under its authority from engaging in an unfair deceptive or abusive act or practice in connection with consumer financial products and services under tila as implemented by regulation z mortgage lenders are required to make a reasonable and good faith determination based on verified and documented information that a consumer applying for a mortgage loan has a reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms mortgage lenders are required to determine consumers ability to repay in one of two ways the first alternative requires the mortgage lender to consider the following eight underwriting factors when making the credit decision current or reasonably expected income or assets current employment status the monthly payment on the covered transaction the monthly payment on any simultaneous loan the monthly payment for mortgagerelated obligations current debt obligations alimony and child support the monthly dti ratio or residual income and credit history alternatively the mortgage lender can originate qms which are entitled to a presumption that the creditor making the loan satisfied the atr requirements in general a qm is a mortgage loan without negative amortization interestonly payments balloon payments or terms exceeding years in addition to be a qm the points and fees paid by a consumer cannot exceed percent of the total loan amount further on december the cfpb issued two final rules related to qm loans the first rule replaces the strict percent dti threshold for qm loans and provides that in addition to existing requirements a loan receives a conclusive presumption that the consumer had the ability to repay if the apr does not exceed the average prime offer rate for a comparable transaction by percentage points or more as of the date the interest rate is set further a loan receives a rebuttable presumption that the consumer had the ability to repay if the apr exceeds the average prime offer rate for a comparable transaction by percentage points or more but by less than percentage points the second rule creates a new category of seasoned qms for loans that meet certain performance requirements that rule allows a nonqm loan or a rebuttable presumption qm loan to receive a safe harbor from atr liability at the end of a seasoning period of at least months as a seasoned qm if it satisfies certain product restrictions pointsandfees limits and underwriting requirements and the loan meets the designated performance and portfolio requirements during the seasoning period the mandatory compliance date under the first final rule was july but subsequently was delayed by the cfpb to october the second final rule applies to covered transactions for which institutions receive an application after the compliance date for the first final rule the corporation is predominantly an originator of compliant qms the cfpb also has implemented the tilarespa integrated disclosure rules which harmonize disclosure and certain regulatory compliance requirements required under those two statutes with respect to residential mortgage loans the cfpb has issued various forms of interpretative guidance under the rules including in in response to a requirement set forth under the economic growth act to address among other things whether loan estimates and closing disclosures are required for loan assumption transactions additionally the cfpb has the authority to take supervisory and enforcement action against banks and other financial services companies under the agencys jurisdiction that fail to comply with federal consumer financial laws as an idi with total assets of more than billion the bank is subject to the cfpbs supervisory and enforcement authorities the doddfrank act also permits states to adopt stricter consumer protection laws and state attorneys general to enforce consumer protection rules issued by the cfpb as a result of these aspects of the doddfrank act the bank operates in a stringent consumer compliance environment therefore the bank is likely to incur additional costs related to consumer protection compliance including but not limited to potential costs associated with cfpb examinations regulatory and enforcement actions and consumeroriented litigation which is likely to increase as a result of the consumer protection provisions of the doddfrank act the cfpb has been active in bringing enforcement actions against banks and other financial institutions to enforce consumer financial laws the federal financial regulatory agencies including the occ and states attorneys general also have become increasingly active in this area with respect to institutions over which they have jurisdiction we have incurred and may in the future incur additional costs in complying with these requirements pursuant to the doddfrank act the fdic has backup enforcement authority over a depository institution holding company such as the parent company if the conduct or threatened conduct of such holding company poses a risk to the dif although such authority may not be used if the holding company is generally in sound condition and does not pose a foreseeable and material risk to the dif the doddfrank act may have a material impact on the corporations and the banks operations particularly through increased compliance costs resulting from possible future consumer and fair lending regulations see the risk factors section for a more extensive discussion of this topic climaterelated risk management and regulation in recent years the federal banking agencies have increased their focus on climaterelated risks impacting the operations of banks the communities they serve and the broader financial system accordingly the agencies have begun to enhance their supervisory expectations regarding the climate risk management practices of larger banking organizations including by encouraging such banks to ensure that management of climaterelated risk exposures has been incorporated into existing governance structures evaluate the potential impact of climaterelated risks on the banks financial condition operations and business objectives as part of its strategic planning process account for the effects of climate change in stress testing scenarios and systemic risk assessments revise expectations for credit portfolio concentrations based on climaterelated factors consider investments in climaterelated initiatives and lending to communities disproportionately impacted by the effects of climate change evaluate the impact of climate change on the banks borrowers and consider possible changes to underwriting criteria to account for climaterelated risks to mortgaged properties incorporate climaterelated financial risk into the banks internal reporting monitoring and escalation processes and prepare for the transition risks to the bank associated with the adjustment to a lowcarbon economy and related changes in laws regulations governmental policies technology and consumer behavior and expectations on october the financial stability oversight council published a report identifying climaterelated financial risks as an emerging threat to financial stability on december the occ issued proposed principles for climaterelated financial risk management for national banks with more than billion in total assets further on march and december respectively the fdic and federal reserve issued their own proposed principles for climate risk management which also are applicable to larger banking organizations although these risk management principles if adopted as proposed would not apply to the bank directly based upon our current size the occ has indicated that all banks regardless of their size may have material exposures to climaterelated financial and other risks that require prudent management the federal banking agencies either independently or on an interagency basis are expected to adopt a more formal climate risk management framework for larger banking organizations in the interim the federal reserve announced on september that six of the largest us banking organizations will participate in a climate scenario analysis program in order to assess the resilience of such organizations under various hypothetical scenarios involving climaterelated economic and financial variables as climaterelated supervisory guidance is formalized and relevant risk areas and corresponding control expectations are further refined we may be required to expend significant capital and incur compliance operating maintenance and remediation costs in order to conform to such requirements additionally in march of the sec proposed new climaterelated disclosure rules the proposed rules for the enhancement and standardization of the climaterelated disclosure for investors file no s71022 if adopted as expected in the rules would require new climaterelated disclosures in sec filings and audited financial statements including certain climaterelated metrics and greenhouse gas emissions data information about climaterelated targets and goals transition plans if any and attestation requirements in addition states are considering taking similar actions on climaterelated financial risks including certain states in which we operate for example in january of a group of lawmakers in the wisconsin legislature introduced a series of bills addressing through a mix of funding and legal requirements enhanced energy efficiency funding climate change resiliency urban heat islands environmental impacts to vulnerable communities green jobs training and food waste reduction that same month the minnesota house climate action caucus introduced a billion climate action plan to address the climate crisis which allocates funds to broad initiatives impacting energy transportation built environment lands and adaptation resilience later in april of wisconsin governor tony evers announced the creation of the office of environmental justice within the wisconsin department of administration the office is tasked with among other things analyzing and reviewing the impact that state laws regulations and policy have on the equitable treatment and protection of communities threatened by environmental harms including climate change and advising various state agencies and partners on how to best address these impacts in may of the illinois state treasurer and the msbi both submitted comments supporting the secs proposed rules for the enhancement and standardization of the climaterelated disclosure for investors file no s71022 additionally illinois attorney general kwame raoul minnesota attorney general keith ellison and wisconsin attorney general josh kaul all joined a coalition of attorneys general in supporting the proposed rules while the msbi adopted its own resolution on climate change riskrelated information transparency further proclaiming its support statelevel initiatives such as these may require us to expend capital to conform to any requirements that apply to us the corporation has established an environmental sustainability risk policy and environmental sustainability statement focused on environmental risk management climate change carbon emissions and natural resources and environmental and social lending which will serve as the foundation to associateds environmental sustainability risk management system a system for supporting the environmental sustainability risk policy and environmental sustainability risk reporting the ems is intended to help so that management of environmental and climate risk is done in a comprehensive systematic planned and documented manner and to help so that all policy practices are integrated into the corporations enterprise risk management program and align with business objectives the corporation joined the tcfd and value

facilities and real estate marketing operations and technology purchasing retail bank and wholesale bank teams digital asset regulation the federal banking agencies have issued interpretive guidance and statements regarding the engagement by banking organizations in certain digital asset activities in november of the occ published an interpretive letter clarifying that the digital asset activities of national banks that have been addressed by the occ in prior interpretive precedent published in and are viewed by the agency as legally permissible provided that banks i are able to demonstrate to the occ that their digital asset activities can be conducted in a safe and sound manner and ii notify the occs supervisory staff of their intention to engage in such activities and receive the occs nonobjection prior to doing so on august the federal reserve released supervisory guidance encouraging all banking organizations supervised by the agency to notify its lead supervisory point of contact at the federal reserve prior to engaging in any digital assetrelated activity prior to engaging in any such activities banking organizations are expected to ensure their proposed activities are legally permissible under relevant state and federal laws and ensure they have implemented adequate systems risk management and internal controls to ensure that the activities are conducted in a safe and sound manner consistent with applicable laws including consumer protection laws more recently on january the federal banking agencies issued additional guidance in the form of a joint statement addressing digital assetrelated risks to banking organizations that statement noted the recent volatility and exposure of vulnerabilities in the digital asset sector and indicated that the agencies are continuing to assess whether or how the digital assetrelated activities of banking organizations can be conducted in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations the statement stressed that each agency has developed and expects banking organizations to follow supervisory processes for evaluating proposed and existing digital asset activities although the federal banking agencies have not developed formal regulations governing the digital asset activities of banking organizations the supervisory framework summarized above dictates that in order to effectively identify and manage digital assetrelated risks and obtain supervisory nonobjection to the proposed engagement in digital asset activities banking organizations must implement appropriate risk management practices including with respect to board and management oversight policies and procedures risk assessments internal controls and monitoring other banking regulations the bank is also subject to a variety of other regulations with respect to the operation of its businesses including but not limited to the doddfrank act which among other restrictions placed limitations on the interchange fees charged for debit card transactions tila truth in savings act equal credit opportunity act electronic funds transfer act fair housing act home mortgage

consumer protection act canspam act childrens online privacy protection act and the john warner ndaa further in january of the occ issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to amend current rules related to national banks ownership of real property the proposal would provide a set of general standards including an occupancy test and excess capacity standards that the occ will use to determine whether the acquisition and holding of real estate is necessary for the transaction of an institutions business the prospects and timing for the adoption of a final rule are uncertain at this time the laws and regulations to which we are subject are constantly under review by congress the federal regulatory agencies and the state authorities these laws and regulations could be changed drastically in the future which could affect our profitability our ability to compete effectively or the composition of the financial services industry in which we compete government monetary policies and economic controls our earnings and growth as well as the earnings and growth of the banking industry are affected by the credit policies of monetary authorities including the federal reserve an important function of the federal reserve is to regulate the national supply of bank credit in order to combat recession and curb inflationary pressures among the instruments of monetary policy used by the federal reserve to implement these objectives are open market operations in us government securities changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits and changes in the federal reserve discount rate these instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth of bank loans investments and deposits and may also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits the monetary policies of the federal reserve authorities have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to have such an effect in the future in view of changing conditions in the national economy and in money markets as well as the effect of credit policies by monetary and fiscal authorities including the federal reserve it is difficult to predict the impact of possible future changes in interest rates deposit levels and loan demand or their effect on our business and earnings or on the financial condition of our various customers other regulatory authorities in addition to regulation supervision and examination by federal banking agencies the corporation and certain of its subsidiaries including those that engage in securities brokerage dealing and investment advisory activities are subject to other federal and applicable state securities laws and regulations and to supervision and examination by other regulatory authorities including the sec finra nyse dol and others separately in june of pursuant to the doddfrank act the sec adopted regulation best interest which among other things establishes a new standard of conduct for a brokerdealer to act in the best interest of a retail customer when making a recommendation of any securities transaction or investment strategy involving securities to such customer the new rule requires us to review and possibly modify our compliance activities which is causing us to incur some additional costs in addition state laws that impose a
