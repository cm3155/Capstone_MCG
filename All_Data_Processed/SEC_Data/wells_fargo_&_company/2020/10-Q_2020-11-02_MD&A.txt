third quarter compared with the same period a year ago reflected an increase in the acl for loans due to the economic impact of the covid19 pandemic we consider multiple economic scenarios to develop

estimate of the acl for loans at september was based on a weighting of the base case and downside economic scenarios of and respectively with no weighting applied to the upside scenario the base case economic forecast assumed nearterm economic stress recovering into late the downside scenario assumed more sustained adverse economic impacts resulting from the covid19 pandemic compared with the base case the downside scenario assumed us real gdp increasing slowly and not fully recovering during the remainder of and and a sustained elevation in the us unemployment rate until mid2022 we considered expectations for the impact of government economic stimulus programs in effect on september however we did not consider the impact of future government economic stimulus programs in addition we considered expectations for the impact of customer accommodation activity as well as the estimated impact on certain industries that we consider to be directly and most adversely affected by the

assumptions and performance and other subjective factors including industry trends and emerging risk assessments the forecasted key economic variables used in our estimate of the acl for loans generally reflected improvement from our prior expectations resulting in lower loss expectations in the quantitative component of our acl for loans at september however we significantly increased the

deferrals also delay the collection of contractually specified servicing fees resulting in lower net servicing income in accordance with applicable servicing guidelines delinquency status continues to

liquidity and funding primary oversight of interest rate risk and market risk resides with the finance committee of our board which oversees the administration and effectiveness of financial risk management assetliability management continued policies and processes used to assess and manage these risks primary oversight of liquidity and funding resides with the risk committee of the board at the management level we utilize a corporate assetliability committee corporate alco which consists of management from finance risk and business groups to oversee these risks and provide periodic reports to the boards finance committee and risk committee as appropriate as discussed in more detail for market risk activities below we employ separate management level oversight specific to market risk interest rate risk interest rate risk which potentially can have a significant earnings impact is an integral part of being a financial intermediary we are subject to interest rate risk because assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times for example if assets reprice faster than liabilities and interest rates are generally rising earnings will initially increase assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by different amounts for example when the general level of interest rates is rising we may increase rates paid on checking and savings deposit accounts by an amount that is less than the general rise in market interest rates shortterm and longterm market interest rates may change by different amounts for example the shape of the yield curve may affect new loan yields and funding costs differently the remaining maturity of various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change for example if longterm mortgage interest rates increase sharply mbs held in the debt securities portfolio may pay down slower than anticipated which could impact portfolio income or interest rates may also have a direct or indirect effect on loan demand collateral values credit losses mortgage origination volume the fair value of msrs and other financial instruments the value of the pension liability and other items affecting earnings we assess interest rate risk by comparing outcomes under various net interest income simulations using many interest rate scenarios that differ in the direction of interest rate changes the degree of change over time the speed of change and the projected shape of the yield curve these simulations require assumptions regarding drivers of earnings and balance sheet composition such as loan originations prepayment speeds on loans and debt securities deposit flows and mix as well as pricing strategies currently our profile is such that we project net interest income will benefit from higher interest rates as our assets would reprice faster and to a greater degree than our liabilities while in the case of lower interest rates our assets would reprice downward and to a greater degree than our liabilities our most recent simulations estimate net interest income sensitivity over the next two years under a range of both lower and higher interest rates measured impacts from standardized ramps gradual changes and shocks instantaneous changes are summarized in table indicating net interest income sensitivity relative to the companys base net interest income plan ramp scenarios assume interest rates move gradually in parallel across the yield curve relative to the base scenario in year one and the full amount of the ramp is held as a constant differential to the base scenario in year two the following describes the simulation assumptions for the scenarios presented in table simulations are dynamic and reflect anticipated growth across assets and liabilities other macroeconomic variables that could be correlated with the changes in interest rates are held constant mortgage prepayment and origination assumptions vary across scenarios and reflect only the impact of the higher or lower interest rates our base scenario deposit forecast incorporates mix changes consistent with the base interest rate trajectory deposit mix is modeled to be the same as in the base scenario across the alternative scenarios in higher interest rate scenarios customer activity that shifts balances into higheryielding products could reduce expected net interest income we

income and expense impacts our interest rate sensitive noninterest income and expense are predominantly driven by mortgage banking activities and may move in the opposite direction of our net interest income mortgage originations generally decline in response to higher interest rates and generally increase particularly refinancing activity in response to lower interest rates mortgage results are also impacted by the valuation of msrs and related hedge positions see the risk management assetliability management mortgage banking interest rate and market risk section in this report for additional information interest rate sensitive noninterest income also results from changes in earnings credit for noninterestbearing deposits that reduce treasury management deposit service fees additionally for the trading portfolio our trading assets are before the effects of certain economic hedges generally less sensitive to changes in interest rates than the related funding liabilities as a result net interest income from the trading portfolio contracts and expands as interest rates rise and fall respectively the impact to net interest income does not include the fair value changes of trading securities and loans which along with the effects of related economic hedges are recorded in noninterest income we use the debt securities portfolio and exchangetraded and overthecounter

on the use of the availableforsale and heldtomaturity securities portfolios the notional or contractual amount credit risk amount and fair value of the derivatives used to hedge our interest rate risk exposures as of september and december are presented in note derivatives to financial statements in this report we use derivatives for assetliability management in two main ways to convert the cash flows from selected asset andor liability instrumentsportfolios including investments commercial loans and longterm debt from fixedrate payments to floatingrate payments or vice versa and to economically hedge our mortgage origination pipeline funded mortgage loans and msrs using interest rate swaps swaptions futures forwards and options mortgage banking interest rate and market risk we

risk see the risk management assetliability management mortgage banking interest rate and market risk section in our form 10k while our hedging activities are designed to balance our mortgage banking interest rate risks the financial instruments we use may not perfectly correlate with the values and income being hedged for example the change in the value of arm production held for sale from changes in mortgage interest rates may or may not be fully offset by indexbased financial instruments used as economic hedges for such arms hedge results may also be impacted as the overall level of hedges changes as interest rates change or as there are other changes in the market for mortgage forwards that may affect the implied carry on the msrs the total carrying value of our residential and

are scheduled to be fully phasedin by the end of the basel iii capital rules contain two frameworks for calculating capital requirements a standardized approach and an advanced approach applicable to certain institutions including wells fargo our capital adequacy is assessed based on the lower of our riskbased capital ratios calculated under the standardized approach and under the advanced approach the difference between rwas under the standardized and advanced approach has narrowed in recent quarters due to economic conditions from the covid19 pandemic impacting our calculation of advanced approach rwas in particular changes in internal credit ratings in our loan portfolio contributed to an increase in our advanced approach rwas at september we expect this trend to continue if the economic impact of the covid19 pandemic continues to affect our customer base effective october a stress capital buffer replaced the capital conservation buffer under the standardized approach the stress capital buffer is calculated based on the decrease in a bhcs riskbased capital ratios under the severely adverse scenario in the frbs annual supervisory stress test and related comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar plus four quarters of planned common stock dividends on august the frb announced that the companys stress capital buffer for the period october through september is because the stress capital buffer is calculated annually as part of the frbs supervisory stress test and related ccar and will be based on data that can differ over time our stress capital buffer and thus the regulatory minimums for our riskbased capital ratios are subject to change in future years as a gsib we are also subject to the frbs rule implementing the additional capital surcharge of between on the minimum capital requirements of gsibs under the rule we must annually calculate our surcharge under two methods and use the higher of the two surcharges the first method method one considers our size interconnectedness crossjurisdictional activity substitutability and complexity consistent with the methodology developed by the bcbs and the financial stability board fsb the second method method two uses similar inputs but replaces substitutability with use of shortterm wholesale funding and will generally result in higher surcharges than the bcbs methodology because the gsib capital surcharge is calculated annually based on data that can differ over time the amount of the surcharge is subject to change in future years capital management we have an active program for

maintain i a tlac buffer equal to of rwas plus our applicable gsib capital surcharge calculated under method one plus any applicable countercyclical buffer to be added to the minimum and ii an external tlac leverage buffer equal to of total leverage exposure to be added to the minimum in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments us gsibs are also required to have a minimum amount of eligible unsecured longterm debt equal to the greater of i of rwas plus our applicable gsib capital surcharge calculated under method two and ii of the total leverage exposure under the proposed slr rules the external tlac leverage buffer would be replaced with a buffer equal to onehalf of our applicable gsib capital surcharge and the leverage component for calculating the minimum amount of eligible unsecured longterm debt would be modified from of total leverage exposure to of total leverage exposure plus onehalf of our applicable gsib capital surcharge as of september our eligible external tlac as a percentage of total riskweighted assets was compared with a required minimum of similar to the risk based capital requirements our minimum tlac requirement is assessed based on the greater of rwas determined under the standardized and advanced approaches other regulatory capital and liquidity matters as discussed in the risk management asset liability management liquidity and funding liquidity standards section in this report federal banking regulators have issued a final rule regarding the us implementation of the basel iii lcr and a proposed rule regarding the nsfr capital planning and stress testing our planned longterm capital structure is designed to meet regulatory and market expectations we believe that our long term targeted capital structure enables us to invest in and grow our business satisfy our customers financial needs in varying environments access markets and maintain flexibility to return capital to our shareholders our longterm targeted capital structure also considers capital levels sufficient to exceed capital requirements including the gsib capital surcharge accordingly based on the final basel iii capital rules under the lower of the standardized or advanced approaches cet1 capital ratios we currently target a longterm cet1 capital ratio at or in excess of which includes a gsib capital surcharge our capital targets are subject to change based on various factors including changes to the regulatory capital framework and expectations for large banks promulgated by bank regulatory agencies changes to the regulatory minimums for our capital ratios including changes to our stress capital buffer planned capital actions changes in our risk profile and other factors under the frbs capital plan rule large bhcs are required to submit capital plans annually for review to determine if the frb has any objections before making any capital distributions the rule requires updates to capital plans in the event of material changes in a bhcs risk profile including as a result of any significant acquisitions the frb assesses among other things the overall financial condition risk profile and capital adequacy of bhcs when evaluating capital plans our capital plan which was submitted on april as part of ccar included a comprehensive capital outlook supported by an assessment of expected sources and uses of capital over a given planning horizon under a range of expected and stress scenarios as part of the ccar the frb also generated a supervisory stress test which assumed a sharp decline in the economy and significant decline in asset pricing using the information provided by the company to estimate performance the frb reviewed the supervisory stress test on september the frb announced that it was extending through fourth quarter measures it announced on june prohibiting large bhcs subject to the frbs capital plan rule including wells fargo from making capital distributions subject to certain limited exceptions that are described in the capital planning and stress testing section above at september we had remaining board authority to repurchase approximately million shares subject to regulatory and legal conditions for additional information about share repurchases during third quarter see part ii item in this report historically our policy has been to repurchase shares under the safe harbor conditions of rule of the securities exchange act of including a limitation on the daily volume of repurchases rule imposes an additional daily volume limitation on share repurchases during a pending merger or acquisition in which shares of our stock will constitute some or all of the consideration our management may determine that during a pending stock merger or acquisition when the safe harbor would otherwise be available it is in our best interest to repurchase shares in excess of this additional daily volume limitation in such cases we intend to repurchase shares in compliance with the other conditions of the safe harbor including the standing daily volume limitation that applies whether or not there is a pending stock merger or acquisition capital management continued results both as required under the doddfrank act using a common set of capital actions for all large bhcs and by taking into account the companys proposed capital actions the frb published its supervisory stress test results as required under the doddfrank act on june on june the frb also announced that it was requiring large bhcs including wells fargo to update and resubmit their capital plans within days after the frb provides updated scenarios the frb released the updated scenarios on september and has announced that it will release bhc specific results under the updated scenarios by the end of on september the frb announced that it was extending through fourth quarter measures it announced on june prohibiting large bhcs subject to the frbs capital plan rule including wells fargo from making any capital distribution excluding any capital distribution arising from the issuance of a capital instrument eligible for inclusion in the numerator of a regulatory capital ratio unless otherwise approved by the frb the frb has generally authorized bhcs to i make share repurchases relating to issuances of common stock related to employee stock ownership plans ii provided that the bhc does not increase the amount of its common stock dividends pay common stock dividends that do not exceed an amount equal to the average of the bhcs net income for the four preceding calendar quarters unless otherwise specified by the frb and iii make scheduled payments on additional tier and tier capital instruments these provisions may be extended by the frb quarterbyquarter concurrently with ccar federal banking regulators also require large bhcs and banks to conduct their own stress tests to evaluate whether the institution has sufficient capital to continue to operate during periods of adverse economic and financial conditions these stress testing requirements set forth the timing and type of stress test activities large bhcs and banks must undertake as well as rules governing stress testing controls oversight and disclosure requirements we submitted the results of our stress test to the frb and disclosed a summary of the results in june securities repurchases from time to time the board authorizes the company to repurchase shares of our common stock although we announce when the board authorizes share repurchases we typically do not give any public notice before we repurchase our shares future stock repurchases may be private or openmarket repurchases including block transactions accelerated or delayed block transactions forward repurchase transactions and similar transactions additionally we may enter into plans to purchase stock that satisfy the conditions of rule 10b51 of the securities exchange act of various factors determine the amount of our share repurchases including our capital requirements the number of shares we expect to issue for employee benefit plans and acquisitions market conditions including the trading price of our stock and regulatory and legal considerations including the frbs response to our capital plan and to changes in our risk profile due to the various factors impacting the amount of our share repurchases and the fact that we tend to be in the market regularly to satisfy repurchase considerations under our capital plan our share repurchases occur at various price levels we may suspend share repurchase activity at any time in addition the occ and the frb issued guidelines for banks and bhcs related to working with customers affected by the covid19 pandemic including guidance with respect to waiving fees offering repayment accommodations and providing payment deferrals any current or future rules regulations and guidance related to the covid19 pandemic and its impacts could require us to change certain of our business practices reduce our revenue and earnings impose additional costs on us or otherwise adversely affect our business operations andor competitive position regulatory matters since the enactment of the doddfrank act in the us financial services industry has been subject to a significant increase in regulation and regulatory oversight initiatives this increased regulation and oversight has substantially changed how most us financial services companies conduct business and has increased their regulatory compliance costs for a discussion of certain consent orders applicable to the company see the overview section in this report the following supplements our discussion of the other significant regulations and regulatory oversight initiatives that have affected or may affect our business contained in the regulatory matters and risk factors sections in our form 10k and in our first and second quarter reports on form 10q regulatory developments related to covid19 in response to the covid19 pandemic and related events federal banking regulators have undertaken a number of measures to help stabilize the banking sector support the broader economy and facilitate the ability of banking organizations like wells fargo to continue lending to consumers and businesses for example in order to facilitate the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act federal banking regulators issued rules designed to encourage financial institutions to participate in stimulus measures such as the small business administrations paycheck protection program and the frbs main street lending program similarly the frb launched a number of lending facilities designed to enhance liquidity and the functioning of markets including facilities covering money market mutual funds and term assetbacked securities loans federal banking regulators also issued several rules amending the regulatory capital and tlac rules and other prudential regulations to ease certain restrictions on banking organizations and encourage the use of certain frbestablished facilities in order to further promote lending to consumers and businesses critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies see note summary of significant accounting policies to financial statements in our form 10k are fundamental to understanding our results of operations and financial condition because they require that we use estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results five of these policies are critical because they require management to make difficult subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions these policies govern the allowance for credit losses acl the valuation of residential msrs the fair value of financial instruments income taxes and liability for contingent litigation losses management and the boards audit committee have reviewed and approved these critical accounting policies these policies are described further in the financial review critical accounting policies section and note summary of significant accounting policies to financial statements in our form 10k in connection with our adoption of cecl on january we have updated our critical accounting policy for the allowance for credit losses allowance for credit losses we maintain an acl for loans which is managements estimate of the expected credit losses in the loan portfolio and unfunded credit commitments at the balance sheet date excluding loans and unfunded credit commitments carried at fair value or held for sale additionally we maintain an allowance for credit losses for debt securities classified as either heldtomaturity htm or availableforsale afs other financial assets measured at amortized cost net investments in leases and other offbalance sheet credit exposures in connection with our adoption of cecl we updated our approach for estimating expected credit losses which includes new areas for management judgment described more fully below and updated our accounting policies for additional information see note summary of significant accounting policies to financial statements in this report for loans and htm debt securities the acl is measured based on the remaining contractual term of the financial asset including offbalance sheet credit exposures adjusted as appropriate for prepayments and permitted extension options using historical experience current conditions and forecasted information for afs debt securities the acl is measured using a discounted cash flow approach and is limited to the difference between the fair value of the security and its amortized cost changes in the acl and therefore in the related provision for credit losses can materially affect net income in applying the judgment and review required to determine the acl management considerations include the evaluation of past events historical experience changes in economic forecasts and conditions customer behavior collateral values and the length of the initial loss forecast period and other influences from time to time changes in economic factors or assumptions business strategy products or product mix or debt security investment strategy may result in a corresponding increase or decrease in our acl while our methodology attributes portions of the acl to specific financial asset classes loan and debt security portfolios or loan portfolio segments commercial and consumer the entire acl is available to absorb credit losses of the company judgment is specifically applied in economic assumptions and the length of the initial loss forecast period forecasted economic variables such as gross domestic product gdp unemployment rate or collateral asset prices are used to estimate expected credit losses while many of these economic variables are evaluated at the macroeconomy level some economic variables may be forecasted at more granular levels for example using the metro statistical area msa level for unemployment rates home prices and commercial real estate prices quarterly we assess the length of the initial loss forecast period and have currently set the period to one year management exercises judgment when assigning weight to the three economic scenarios that are used to estimate future credit losses the three scenarios include a most likely expectation of economic variables referred to as the base case scenario as well as an optimistic upside scenario and a pessimistic downside scenario reversion of losses beyond the initial forecast period we use a reversion approach to connect the losses estimated for our initial loss forecast period to the period of our historical loss forecast based on economic conditions at the measurement date our reversion methodology considers the type of portfolio point in the credit cycle expected length of recessions and recoveries as well as other relevant factors the length of reversion period varies by asset type one year for shorter contractual term loans such as commercial loans and two years for longer contractual term loans such as real estate family mortgage loans we assess the reversion approach on a quarterly basis and the length of the reversion period by asset type annually historical loss expectations at the end of the reversion period we incorporate the changes in economic variables observed during representative historical time periods that include both recessions and expansions this analysis is used to compute average losses for any given portfolio and its associated credit characteristics annually we assess the historical time periods and ensure the average loss estimates are representative of our historical loss experience credit risk ratings applied to individual commercial loans unfunded credit commitments and debt securities individually assessed credit risk ratings are considered key credit variables in our modeled approaches to help assess probability of default and loss given default borrower quality ratings are aligned to the borrowers financial strength and contribute to forecasted probability of default curves collateral quality ratings combined with forecasted collateral prices as applicable contribute to the forecasted severity of loss in the event of default these credit risk ratings are reviewed by experienced senior credit officers and subjected to reviews by an internal team of credit risk specialists usage of credit loss estimation models we use internally developed models that incorporate credit attributes and economic variables to generate estimates of credit losses management uses a combination of judgement and quantitative analytics in the determination of segmentation modeling approach and variables that are leveraged in the models these models are validated in accordance with the companys policies by an internal model validation group we routinely assess our model performance and apply our sensitivity analysis does not represent managements view of expected credit losses at the balance sheet date we applied weight to both the base case scenario and the downside scenario in our sensitivity analysis to reflect the potential for further economic deterioration from a covid19 resurgence the outcomes of both scenarios were influenced by the duration severity and timing of changes in economic variables within those scenarios the sensitivity analysis resulted in a hypothetical increase in the acl for loans of approximately billion at september the hypothetical increase in our acl for loans does not incorporate the impact of management judgment for qualitative factors applied in the current acl for loans which may have a positive or negative effect on the results it is possible that others performing similar sensitivity analyses could reach different conclusions or results the sensitivity analysis excludes the acl for debt securities given its size relative to the overall acl management believes that the estimate for the acl for loans was appropriate at the balance sheet date adjustments when necessary to improve the accuracy of loss estimation we also assess our models for limitations against the companywide risk inventory to help ensure that we appropriately capture known and emerging risks in our estimate of expected credit losses and apply overlays as needed valuation of collateral the current fair value of collateral is utilized to assess the expected credit losses when a financial asset is considered to be collateral dependent we apply judgment when valuing the collateral either through appraisals evaluation of the cash flows of the property or other quantitative techniques decreases in collateral valuations support incremental chargedowns and increases in collateral valuation are included in the allowance for credit losses as a negative allowance when the financial asset has been previously writtendown below current recovery value contractual term considerations the remaining contractual term of a loan is adjusted for expected prepayments and certain expected extensions renewals or modifications we extend the contractual term when we are not able to unconditionally cancel contractual renewals or extension options we also incorporate into our allowance for credit losses any scenarios where we reasonably expect to provide an extension through a tdr qualitative factors which may not be adequately captured in the loss models these amounts represent managements judgment of risks inherent in the processes and assumptions used in establishing the acl we also consider economic environmental factors modeling assumptions and performance process risk and other subjective factors including industry trends and emerging risk assessments sensitivity the acl for loans is sensitive to changes in key assumptions which requires significant judgment to be used by management future amounts of the acl for loans will be based on a variety of factors including loan balance changes portfolio credit quality and general economic conditions general economic conditions are forecasted using economic variables which could have varying impacts on different financial assets or portfolios additionally throughout numerous credit cycles there are observed changes in economic variables such as the unemployment rate gdp and real estate prices which may not move in a correlated manner as variables may move in opposite directions or differ across portfolios or geography current accounting developments table provides the significant accounting updates applicable to us that have been issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb but are not yet effective table current accounting developments issued standards description effective date and financial statement impact asu financial services insurance topic targeted improvements to the accounting for longduration contracts and subsequent related updates the update requires all features in longduration insurance contracts that meet the definition of a market risk benefit to be measured at fair value through earnings with changes in fair value attributable to our own credit risk recognized in other comprehensive income currently two measurement models exist for these features fair value and insurance accrual the update requires the use of a standardized discount rate and routine updates for insurance assumptions used in valuing the liability for future policy benefits for traditional longduration contracts the update also simplifies the amortization of deferred acquisition costs the guidance becomes effective on january certain of our variable annuity reinsurance products meet the definition of market risk benefits and will require the associated insurance related reserves for these products to be measured at fair value as of the earliest period presented with the cumulative effect on fair value for changes attributable to our own credit risk recognized in the beginning balance of accumulated other comprehensive income the cumulative effect of the difference between fair value and carrying value excluding the effect of our own credit will be recognized in the opening balance of retained earnings as of september we held billion in insurancerelated reserves of which million was in scope of the update a total of million was associated with products that meet the definition of market risk benefits and of this amount million was measured at fair value under current accounting standards the market risk benefits are largely indexed to us equity and fixed income markets upon adoption we may incur periodic earnings volatility from changes in the fair value of market risk benefits generally due to the long duration of these contracts we plan to economically hedge this volatility where feasible the ultimate impact of these changes will depend on the composition of our market risk benefits portfolio at the date of adoption changes in the accounting for the liability of future policy benefits for traditional longduration contracts and deferred acquisition costs will be applied to all outstanding longduration contracts on the basis of their existing carrying amounts at the beginning of the earliest period presented and are not expected to be material the following updates are applicable to us but are not expected to have a

global supply chains affected equity market valuations created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets and increased unemployment levels in addition the pandemic has resulted in restrictions and closures for many businesses as well as the institution of social distancing and sheltering in place requirements in many states and communities as a result the demand for our products and services may continue to be significantly impacted which could adversely affect our revenue furthermore the pandemic could continue to result in the recognition of credit losses in our loan portfolios and increases in our allowance for credit losses particularly if businesses remain closed the impact on the global economy worsens or more customers draw on their lines of credit or seek additional loans to help finance their businesses similarly because of changing economic and market conditions affecting issuers we may be required to recognize further impairments on the
