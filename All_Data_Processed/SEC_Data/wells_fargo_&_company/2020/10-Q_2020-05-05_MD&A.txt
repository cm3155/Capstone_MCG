estimating fair values of our reporting units the update to assumptions incorporated current marketbased information such as priceearnings information and a regular update to our internal enterprisewide forecasts which reflected lower interest rates and higher expected credit losses as well as a weaker macroeconomic outlook while we observed declines in the fair values of our reporting units and the amount of excess fair value over the carrying amount of our reporting units we did not have evidence of goodwill impairment due to the impact of the market disruption on our investment banking fees and trading activities our corporate and investment banking reporting unit included within the wholesale banking operating segment had the smallest difference between fair value and carrying value given the uncertainty of the severity or length of the current economic downturn we will continue to monitor market conditions for circumstances that could have a further negative

balance at time of conversion certain lines and loans have been structured with a balloon payment which requires full repayment of the outstanding balance at the end of the term period the conversion

in first quarter compared with the same period a year ago reflected an increase in the allowance for credit losses for loans due to forecasted credit deterioration as a result of the impact of the covid19 pandemic and higher net loan chargeoffs largely in the oil and gas portfolio due to the recent sharp declines in oil prices in determining our allowance for credit losses for loans in first quarter our analysis considered multiple factors to evaluate the rapidly evolving impacts related to the covid19 pandemic we evaluated a range of expected losses based on economic forecasts that projected both a limited and a severe downturn in economic conditions in addition we reviewed several alternative forecasts that included relatively longer yet less severe downturns as well as relatively shorter yet deeper downturns followed by a significant rebound near the end of we also assessed the impact of the federal governments recent economic stimulus programs coupled with expectations for customer accommodation activity of up to six months our forecasted view reflected a sustained recession through with a sustained increase in unemployment and decrease in gross domestic product gdp for the rest of the year we also considered the estimated impact on certain industries that we expect to be directly and most adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic as well as our exposure to the oil and gas industry and the potential for additional draws on commercial loan commitments future amounts of the allowance for credit losses for loans will be based on a variety of factors including loan balance changes portfolio credit quality and mix changes and changes in general economic conditions and expectations including for unemployment and gdp among other factors based on economic conditions at the end of first quarter it was difficult to estimate the length and severity of the economic downturn that may result from the covid19 pandemic and the impact of other factors that may influence the level of eventual losses and corresponding requirements for future amounts of the allowance for credit losses including the impact of economic stimulus programs and customer accommodation activity the ultimate impact of the covid19 pandemic will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic the pandemic could continue to result in the recognition of credit losses in our loan portfolios and increases in our allowance for credit losses particularly if the impact on the economy worsens we believe the allowance for credit losses for loans of billion at march was appropriate to cover expected credit losses including unfunded credit commitments at that date the entire allowance is available to absorb expected credit losses from the total loan portfolio the allowance for credit losses for loans is

monitoring and managing interest rate risk market risk liquidity and funding primary oversight of interest rate risk and market risk resides with the finance committee of our board which oversees the administration and effectiveness of financial risk management policies and processes used to assess and manage these risks primary oversight of liquidity and funding resides with the risk committee of the board at the management level we utilize a corporate assetliability committee corporate alco which consists of management from finance risk and business groups to oversee these risks and provide periodic reports to the boards finance committee and risk committee as appropriate as discussed in more detail for market risk activities below we employ separate management level oversight specific to market risk interest rate risk interest rate risk which potentially can have a significant earnings impact is an integral part of being a financial intermediary we are subject to interest rate risk because assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times for example if assets reprice faster than liabilities and interest rates are generally rising earnings will initially increase assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by different amounts for example when the general level of interest rates is rising we may increase rates paid on checking and savings deposit accounts by an amount that is less than the general rise in market interest rates shortterm and longterm market interest rates may change by different amounts for example the shape of the yield curve may affect new loan yields and funding costs differently the remaining maturity of various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change for example if longterm mortgage interest rates increase sharply mbs held in the debt securities portfolio may pay down slower than anticipated which could impact portfolio income or interest rates may also have a direct or indirect effect on loan demand collateral values credit losses mortgage origination volume the fair value of msrs and other financial instruments the value of the pension liability and other items affecting earnings we assess interest rate risk by comparing outcomes under various net interest income simulations using many interest rate scenarios that differ in the direction of interest rate changes the degree of change over time the speed of change and the projected shape of the yield curve these simulations require assumptions regarding drivers of earnings and balance sheet composition such as loan originations prepayment speeds on loans and debt securities deposit flows and mix as well as pricing strategies currently our profile is such that we project net interest income will benefit modestly from higher interest rates as our assets would reprice faster and to a greater degree than our assetliability management continued liabilities while in the case of lower interest rates our assets would reprice downward and to a greater degree than our liabilities our most recent simulations estimate net interest income sensitivity over the next two years under a range of both lower and higher interest rates measured impacts from standardized ramps gradual changes and shocks instantaneous changes are summarized in table indicating net interest income sensitivity relative to the companys base net interest income plan ramp scenarios assume interest rates move gradually in parallel across the yield curve relative to the base scenario in year one and the full amount of the ramp is held as a constant differential to the base scenario in year two the following describes the simulation assumptions for the scenarios presented in table simulations are dynamic and reflect anticipated growth across assets and liabilities other macroeconomic variables that could be correlated with the changes in interest rates are held constant mortgage prepayment and origination assumptions vary across scenarios and reflect only the impact of the higher or lower interest rates our base scenario deposit forecast incorporates mix changes consistent with the base interest rate trajectory deposit mix is modeled to be the same as in the base scenario across the alternative scenarios in higher interest rate scenarios customer activity that shifts balances into higheryielding products could

interest rates mortgage results are also impacted by the valuation of msrs and related hedge positions see the risk management assetliability management mortgage banking interest rate and market risk

funding liabilities as a result net interest income from the trading portfolio contracts and expands as interest rates rise and fall respectively the impact to net interest income does not include the fair value changes of trading securities and loans which along with the effects of related economic hedges are recorded in noninterest income we use the debt securities portfolio and exchangetraded

company trading general var was million for the quarter ended march compared with million for the quarter ended december and million for the quarter ended march the increase in average as well as period end company trading general var for the quarter ended march compared with the quarter ended march was driven by recent market volatility in particular changes in interest rate curves and a

period end average low high in millions company trading general var risk categories credit interest rate equity commodity foreign exchange diversification benefit company trading general var the periodend var was less than the sum of the var components described above which is due to portfolio diversification the diversification effect arises because the risks are not perfectly correlated

are fully phasedin however the requirements for determining tier and total capital are still in accordance with transition requirements and are scheduled to be fully phasedin by the end of the basel iii capital rules contain two frameworks for calculating capital requirements a standardized approach and an advanced approach applicable to certain institutions including wells fargo accordingly in the assessment of our capital adequacy we must report the lower of our cet1 tier and total capital ratios calculated under the standardized approach and under the advanced approach effective october a stress capital buffer will be added to the minimum capital ratio requirements the stress capital buffer will be calculated based on the decrease in a financial institutions riskbased capital ratios under the supervisory severely adverse scenario in the annual comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar plus four quarters of planned common stock dividends the stress capital buffer will replace the current capital conservation buffer under the standardized approach because the stress capital buffer will be calculated annually as part of ccar and will be based on data that can differ over time the amount of the buffer is subject to change in future years as a gsib we are also subject to the frbs rule implementing the additional capital surcharge of between on the minimum capital requirements of gsibs under the rule we must annually calculate our surcharge under two methods and use the higher of the two surcharges the first method method one considers our size interconnectedness crossjurisdictional activity substitutability and complexity consistent with the methodology developed by the bcbs and the financial stability board fsb the second method two uses similar inputs but replaces substitutability with use of shortterm wholesale funding and will generally result in higher surcharges than the bcbs methodology because the gsib capital surcharge is calculated annually based on data that can differ over time the amount of the surcharge is subject to change in future years the tables that follow provide information about our risk based capital and

as a result of our adoption of cecl on january our allowance for credit losses is now measured using an estimate of expected lifetime credit losses methodology federal banking regulators issued rules permitting banking institutions whose capital levels decreased upon the adoption of cecl to phase in the adoption impact of cecl over a period of three years because we recognized a net reduction to our allowance for credit losses and a resulting increase to our capital levels upon the adoption of cecl we were not eligible for this transition relief in march federal banking regulators also issued

market expectations we believe that our long term targeted capital structure enables us to invest in and grow our business satisfy our customers financial needs in varying environments access markets and maintain flexibility to return capital to our shareholders our longterm targeted capital structure also considers capital levels sufficient to exceed capital requirements including the gsib capital surcharge accordingly based on the final basel iii capital rules under the lower of the standardized or advanced approaches cet1 capital ratios we currently target a longterm cet1 capital ratio at or in excess of which includes a gsib capital surcharge our capital targets are subject to change based on various factors including changes to the regulatory capital framework and expectations for large banks promulgated by bank regulatory agencies planned capital actions changes in our risk profile and other factors as discussed above in the capital management regulatory capital guidelines riskbased capital and risk weighted assets section of this report the frb has issued a final rule that will replace the current capital conservation buffer under the standardized approach with a stress capital buffer implementation of the stress capital buffer may cause our current longterm cet1 capital ratio target of to increase under the frbs capital plan rule large bhcs are required to submit capital plans annually for review to determine if the frb has any objections before making any capital distributions the rule requires updates to capital plans in the event of material at march we had remaining board authority to repurchase approximately million shares subject to regulatory and legal conditions for more information about share repurchases during first quarter see part ii item in this report historically our policy has been to repurchase shares under the safe harbor conditions of rule of the securities exchange act of including a limitation on the daily volume of repurchases rule imposes an additional daily volume limitation on share repurchases during a pending merger or acquisition in which shares of our stock will constitute some or all of the consideration our management may determine that during a pending stock merger or acquisition when the safe harbor would otherwise be available it is in our best interest to repurchase shares in excess of this additional daily volume limitation in such cases we intend to repurchase shares in compliance with the other conditions of the safe harbor including the standing daily volume limitation that applies whether or not there is a pending stock merger or acquisition capital management continued changes in a bhcs risk profile including as a result of any significant acquisitions the frb assesses among other things the overall financial condition risk profile and capital adequacy of bhcs when evaluating capital plans the capital plan rule also limits a large bhcs ability to make capital distributions to the extent its actual capital issuances were less than amounts indicated in its capital plan our capital plan which was submitted on april as part of ccar included a comprehensive capital outlook supported by an assessment of expected sources and uses of capital over a given planning horizon under a range of expected and stress scenarios as part of the ccar the frb also generated a supervisory stress test which assumed a sharp decline in the economy and significant decline in asset pricing using the information provided by the company to estimate performance the frb is expected to review the supervisory stress test results both as required under the doddfrank act using a common set of capital actions for all large bhcs and by taking into account the companys proposed capital actions the frb has indicated that it will publish its supervisory stress test results as required under the doddfrank act and the related ccar results taking into account the companys proposed capital actions by june concurrently with ccar federal banking regulators also require large bhcs and banks to conduct their own stress tests to evaluate whether the institution has sufficient capital to continue to operate during periods of adverse economic and financial conditions these stress testing requirements set forth the timing and type of stress test activities large bhcs and banks must undertake as well as rules governing stress testing controls oversight and disclosure requirements securities repurchases from time to time the board authorizes the company to repurchase shares of our common stock although we announce when the board authorizes share repurchases we typically do not give any public notice before we repurchase our shares future stock repurchases may be private or openmarket repurchases including block transactions accelerated or delayed block transactions forward repurchase transactions and similar transactions additionally we may enter into plans to purchase stock that satisfy the conditions of rule 10b51 of the securities exchange act of various factors determine the amount of our share repurchases including our capital requirements the number of shares we expect to issue for employee benefit plans and acquisitions market conditions including the trading price of our stock and regulatory and legal considerations including the frbs response to our capital plan and to changes in our risk profile due to the various factors impacting the amount of our share repurchases and the fact that we tend to be in the market regularly to satisfy repurchase considerations under our capital plan our share repurchases occur at various price levels we may suspend share repurchase activity at any time on march we along with the other members of the financial services forum suspended our share repurchase activities for the remainder of the first quarter and for second quarter in addition the occ and the frb have issued guidelines for banks and bhcs related to working with customers affected by the covid19 pandemic including guidance with respect to waiving fees offering repayment accommodations providing payment deferrals and increasing daily withdrawal limits at automated teller machines in addition the federal government has instituted a moratorium on certain mortgage foreclosure activities any current or future rules regulations and guidance related to the covid19 pandemic and its impacts could require us to change certain of our business practices reduce our revenue and earnings impose additional costs on us or otherwise adversely affect our business operations andor competitive position community reinvestment act cra rating on may we announced that we received an outstanding rating from the occ on our most recent cra performance evaluation which covers the years to regulatory matters since the enactment of the doddfrank act in the us financial services industry has been subject to a significant increase in regulation and regulatory oversight initiatives this increased regulation and oversight has substantially changed how most us financial services companies conduct business and has increased their regulatory compliance costs for a discussion of certain consent orders applicable to the company see the overview section in this report the following supplements our discussion of the other significant regulations and regulatory oversight initiatives that have affected or may affect our business contained in the regulatory matters and risk factors sections in our form 10k regulatory developments related to covid19 in response to the covid19 pandemic and related events federal banking regulators have undertaken a number of measures to help stabilize the banking sector support the broader economy and facilitate the ability of banking organizations like wells fargo to continue lending to consumers and businesses for example following the passage of the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act in march federal banking regulators issued interim final rules designed to encourage financial institutions to participate in stimulus measures such as the small business administrations paycheck protection program and the frbs main street lending program similarly the frb launched a number of lending facilities designed to enhance liquidity and the functioning of markets including facilities covering money market mutual funds and term asset backed securities loans federal banking regulators have also issued several joint interim final rules amending the regulatory capital and tlac rules and other prudential regulations to ease certain restrictions on banking organizations and encourage the use of certain frbestablished facilities in order to further promote lending to consumers and businesses critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies see note summary of significant accounting policies to financial statements in our form 10k are fundamental to understanding our results of operations and financial condition because they require that we use estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results five of these policies are critical because they require management to make difficult subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions these policies govern the allowance for credit losses the valuation of residential msrs the fair value of financial instruments income taxes and liability for contingent litigation losses management and the boards audit committee have reviewed and approved these critical accounting policies these policies are described further in the financial review critical accounting policies section and note summary of significant accounting policies to financial statements in our form 10k in connection with our adoption of cecl on january we have updated our critical accounting policy for the allowance for credit losses allowance for credit losses we maintain an allowance for credit losses acl for loans which is managements estimate of the expected credit losses in the loan portfolio and unfunded credit commitments at the balance sheet date excluding loans and unfunded credit commitments carried at fair value or held for sale additionally we maintain an allowance for credit losses for debt securities classified as either heldtomaturity htm or availableforsale afs other financial assets measured at amortized cost net investments in leases and other offbalance sheet credit exposures in connection with our adoption of cecl we updated our approach for estimating expected credit losses which includes new areas for management judgment described more fully below and updated our accounting policies for more information see note summary of significant accounting policies to financial statements in this report for loans and htm debt securities the acl is measured based on the remaining contractual term of the financial asset including offbalance sheet credit exposures adjusted as appropriate for prepayments and permitted extension options using historical experience current conditions and forecasted information for afs debt securities the acl is measured using a discounted cash flow approach and is limited to the difference between the fair value of the security and its amortized cost changes in the acl and therefore in the related provision for credit losses can materially affect net income in applying the judgment and review required to determine the acl management considerations include the evaluation of past events historical experience changes in economic forecasts and conditions customer behavior collateral values and the length of the initial loss forecast period and other influences from time to time changes in economic factors or assumptions business strategy products or product mix or debt security investment strategy may result in a corresponding increase or decrease in our acl while our methodology attributes portions of the acl to specific financial asset classes loan and debt security portfolios or loan portfolio segments commercial and consumer the entire acl is available to absorb credit losses of the company judgment is specifically applied in economic assumptions and the length of the initial loss forecast period forecasted economic variables such as gross domestic product gdp unemployment rate or collateral asset prices are used to estimate expected credit losses while many of these economic variables are evaluated at the macroeconomy level some economic variables may be forecasted at more granular levels for example using the metro statistical area msa level for unemployment rates home prices and commercial real estate prices quarterly we assess the length of the initial loss forecast period and have currently set the period to one year reversion of losses beyond the initial forecast period we use a reversion approach to connect the losses estimated for our initial loss forecast period to the period of our historical loss expectations we give consideration to the type of portfolio point in the credit cycle expected length of recessions and recoveries as well as other relevant factors during forecasted periods of expansionary economic conditions we revert immediately to our historical loss expectations however when recessionary conditions are forecasted over the initial loss forecast period we will utilize a linear reversion to the longterm average losses the length of reversion period varies by asset type one year for shorter contractual term loans such as commercial loans and two years for longer contractual term loans such as family mortgage loans we assess the reversion approach on a quarterly basis and the length of the reversion period by asset type annually historical loss expectations at the end of the reversion period we incorporate the changes in economic variables observed during representative historical time periods that include both recessions and expansions this analysis is used to compute average losses for any given portfolio and its associated credit characteristics annually we assess the historical time periods and ensure the average loss estimates are representative of our historical loss experience credit risk ratings applied to individual commercial loans unfunded credit commitments and debt securities individually assessed credit risk ratings are considered key credit variables in our modeled approaches to help assess probability of default and loss given default borrower quality ratings are aligned to the borrowers financial strength and contribute to forecasted probability of default curves collateral quality ratings combined with forecasted collateral prices as applicable contribute to the forecasted severity of loss in the event of default these credit risk ratings are reviewed by experienced senior credit officers and subjected to reviews by an internal team of credit risk specialists usage of credit loss estimation models we use internally developed models that incorporate credit attributes and economic variables to generate estimates of credit losses management uses a combination of judgement and quantitative analytics in the determination of segmentation modeling approach and variables that are leveraged in the models these models are validated in one hypothetical scenario represents an adverse scenario based on changes in economic variables experienced during the last credit crisis compared with the economic forecast used to develop our current acl for loans this adverse scenario reflects a more substantial and sustained increase in unemployment a deeper and more sustained decline in gdp along with significant declines in consumer and commercial real estate prices this adverse scenario resulted in an increase in the acl for loans of billion a second more severe scenario is similar to our annual companyrun stress test compared with the adverse scenario the more severe scenario reflects a sustained but sharper increase in unemployment and a more significant and sustained decline in gdp declines in real estate prices are consistent with the adverse scenario with additional stress to consumer and commercial real estate prices based on our regional and industry concentrations as well as an idiosyncratic stress as a result of declines in oil and gas prices the more severe scenario resulted in an increase in the acl for loans of billion the changes in economic variables in these scenarios were not contemplated in the economic forecast used to develop our current acl for loans in addition these hypothetical increases in our acl for loans represent changes to our quantitative estimate and do not incorporate the impact of management judgment for qualitative factors applied in the current acl for loans which may have an offsetting impact to the scenario results finally if these hypothetical scenarios were to materialize the increase in our acl for loans may be recognized over time if actual loss expectations exceed our historical loss experience these sensitivity analyses are hypothetical scenarios and the results do not represent managements view of expected credit losses at the balance sheet date the sensitivity analyses exclude the acl for debt securities given its size relative to the overall acl management believes that the current estimate for the acl for loans was appropriate at the balance sheet date because significant judgment is used it is possible that others performing similar analyses could reach different conclusions accordance with the companys policies by an internal model validation group we routinely assess our model performance and apply adjustments when necessary to improve the accuracy of loss estimation we also assess our models for limitations against the companywide risk inventory to help ensure that we appropriately capture known and emerging risks in our estimate of expected credit losses and apply overlays as needed valuation of collateral the current fair value of collateral is utilized to assess the expected credit losses when a financial asset is considered to be collateral dependent we apply judgment when valuing the collateral either through appraisals evaluation of the cash flows of the property or other quantitative techniques decreases in collateral valuations support incremental chargedowns and increases in collateral valuation are included in the allowance for credit losses as a negative allowance when the financial asset has been previously writtendown below current recovery value contractual term considerations the remaining contractual term of a loan is adjusted for expected prepayments and certain expected extensions renewals or modifications we extend the contractual term when we are not able to unconditionally cancel contractual renewals or extension options we also incorporate into our allowance for credit losses any scenarios where we reasonably expect to provide an extension through a tdr qualitative factors which may not be adequately captured in the loss models these amounts represent managements judgment of risks inherent in the processes and assumptions used in establishing the acl we also consider economic environmental factors modeling assumptions and performance process risk and other subjective factors including industry trends and emerging risk assessments sensitivity the acl for loans is sensitive to changes in key assumptions which requires significant judgment to be used by management future amounts of the acl for loans will be based on a variety of factors including loan balance changes portfolio credit quality and general economic conditions general economic conditions are forecasted using economic variables which could have varying impacts on different financial assets or portfolios additionally throughout numerous credit cycles there are observed changes in economic variables such as the unemployment rate gdp and real estate prices which may not move in a correlated manner as variables may move in opposite directions or differ across portfolios or geography in order to provide a sensitivity analysis we developed two hypothetical scenarios by applying changes in economic variables to our loan portfolio which affect the expected balances credit quality and mix the outcomes of both scenarios were influenced by the length of the scenario periods as well as the duration and timing of changes in economic variables within those scenarios the scenarios reflect the impact of economic stress and corresponding adverse changes in economic variables for a longer period than the initial loss forecast period used to develop our current acl for loans neither of the scenarios consider any benefit related to economic stimulus programs or other legislative or regulatory relief current accounting developments table provides the significant accounting updates applicable to us that have been issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb but are not yet effective table current accounting developments issued standards description effective date and financial statement impact asu financial services insurance topic targeted improvements to the accounting for longduration contracts and subsequent related updates the update requires all features in longduration insurance contracts that meet the definition of a market risk benefit to be measured at fair value through earnings with changes in fair value attributable to our own credit risk recognized in other comprehensive income currently two measurement models exist for these features fair value and insurance accrual the update requires the use of a standardized discount rate and routine updates for insurance assumptions used in valuing the liability for future policy benefits for traditional longduration contracts the update also simplifies the amortization of deferred acquisition costs the guidance becomes effective on january certain of our variable annuity reinsurance products meet the definition of market risk benefits and will require the associated insurance related reserves for these products to be measured at fair value as of the earliest period presented with the cumulative effect on fair value for changes attributable to our own credit risk recognized in the beginning balance of accumulated other comprehensive income the cumulative effect of the difference between fair value and carrying value excluding the effect of our own credit will be recognized in the opening balance of retained earnings as of march we held billion in insurancerelated reserves of which million was in scope of the update a total of million was associated with products that meet the definition of market risk benefits and of this amount million was measured at fair value under current accounting standards the market risk benefits are largely indexed to us equity and fixed income markets upon adoption we may incur periodic earnings volatility from changes in the fair value of market risk benefits generally due to the long duration of these contracts we plan to economically hedge this volatility where feasible the ultimate impact of these changes will depend on the composition of our market risk benefits portfolio at the date of adoption changes in the accounting for the liability of future policy benefits for traditional longduration contracts and deferred acquisition costs will be applied to all outstanding longduration contracts on the basis of their existing carrying amounts at the beginning of the earliest period presented and are not expected to be material asu reference rate reform topic facilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting we adopted the guidance on april we applied the guidance consistently to contractual amendments made to all applicable floating rate instruments indexed to ibors we elected to apply the guidance on an individual hedgebyhedge basis for changes to hedge accounting relationships the financial statement impact of the update will change each period as contracts existing and new are impacted by reference rate reform activities and as our exposure changes to libor and other ibors the update provides temporary optional relief to ease the potential burden of accounting for reference rate reform activities that affect contractual modifications of floating rate financial instruments indexed to ibors and hedge accounting relationships contractual modifications and changes to existing hedge accounting relationships must meet specific requirements to qualify for the relief upon election the guidance is applied consistently to all applicable instruments where a qualifying contractual modification is accounted for as the continuation of an existing contract rather than a new contract the optional relief facilitates the preservation of existing fair value and cash flow hedge relationships while amending certain contractual terms of hedge accounting relationships and changes the way the amounts excluded from the evaluation of hedge effectiveness are reported in earnings hedging relationships that qualify for the relief will not require discontinuation of the existing hedge accounting relationships the election to apply the optional relief for existing fair value and cash flow hedge accounting relationships may be made on a hedgebyhedge basis and across multiple reporting periods the following updates are applicable to us but are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements asu investments equity securities topic investments equity method and joint ventures topic and derivatives and hedging topic clarifying the interactions between topic topic and topic a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force asu income taxes topic simplifying

provide without unreasonable effort a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of amounts that would be necessary for the reconciliation due to the complexity and inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying future amounts or when they may occur such unavailable information could be significant to future results moreover the pandemic has created additional operational and compliance risks including the need to quickly implement and execute new programs and procedures for the products and services we offer our customers provide enhanced safety measures for our employees and customers comply with rapidly changing regulatory requirements address any increased risk of fraudulent activity and protect the integrity and functionality of our systems and networks as a larger number of our employees work remotely the pandemic could also result in downgrades to our credit ratings or credit outlook in response to the pandemic we have suspended residential property foreclosure sales evictions and involuntary automobile repossessions and are offering fee waivers payment deferrals and other expanded assistance for credit card automobile mortgage small business and

substantially and that dividends or other distributions on the investment could be reduced or eliminated for a discussion of risk factors that could adversely affect our financial results and condition and the value of and return on an investment in the company we refer you to the risk factors section in our form 10k the following risk factor supplements the risk factors section in our form 10k the covid19 pandemic has adversely impacted our business and financial results and the ultimate impact will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic the covid19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy disrupted global supply chains lowered equity market valuations created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets and increased unemployment levels in addition the pandemic has resulted in temporary closures of many businesses and the institution of social distancing and sheltering in place requirements in many states and communities as a result the demand for our products and services may be significantly impacted which could adversely affect our revenue furthermore the pandemic could continue to result in the recognition of credit losses in our loan portfolios and increases in our allowance for credit losses particularly if businesses remain closed the impact on the global economy worsens or more customers draw on their lines of credit or seek additional loans to help finance their businesses similarly because of changing economic and market conditions affecting issuers we may be required to recognize further impairments on the securities we hold as well as reductions in other comprehensive income our business operations may be further disrupted if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively including because of illness quarantines government actions or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic and we have already temporarily closed certain of our branches and offices controls and procedures disclosure controls and procedures the
