consumer protection laws effective during the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act the egrrcpa while largely preserving the fundamental elements of the postdoddfrank act regulatory framework modified certain requirements of the doddfrank act as they applied to regional and community banking organizations certain of the significant requirements of the doddfrank act are listed below with information regarding how they apply to bancshares following the enactment of the egrrcpa capital planning and stress testing the doddfrank act mandated stress tests be developed and performed to ensure financial institutions have sufficient capital to absorb losses and support operations during multiple economic and bank scenarios the egrrcpa gave immediate relief from stress testing for applicable bank holding companies and therefore bancshares is no longer required to submit companyrun annual stress tests notwithstanding these amendments to the stress testing requirements the federal banking agencies indicated through interagency guidance the capital planning and risk management practices of institutions with total assets less than billion would continue to be reviewed through the regular supervisory process bancshares will continue to monitor its capital consistent with the safety and soundness expectations of the federal regulators through the use
