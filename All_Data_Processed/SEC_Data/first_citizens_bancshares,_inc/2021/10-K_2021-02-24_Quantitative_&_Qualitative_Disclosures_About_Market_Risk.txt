item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk risk management risk is inherent in any business bancshares has defined a moderate risk appetite a conservative approach to risk taking with a philosophy which does not preclude higher risk business activities balanced with acceptable returns while meeting regulatory objectives through the comprehensive enterprise risk management framework and risk appetite framework senior management has primary responsibility for daytoday management of the risks we face with accountability of and support from all associates senior management applies various strategies to reduce the risks to which bancshares may be exposed with effective challenge and oversight by management committees in addition the board strives to ensure the business culture is integrated with the enterprise risk management program and policies procedures and metrics for identifying assessing monitoring and managing risk are part of the decisionmaking process the boards role in risk oversight is an integral part of our overall enterprise risk management framework and risk appetite framework the board administers its risk oversight function primarily through the board risk committee the board risk committee structure is designed to allow for information flow effective challenge and timely escalation of riskrelated issues the board risk committee is directed to monitor and advise the board of directors regarding risk exposures including credit market capital liquidity operational compliance strategic and reputational risks review approve and monitor adherence to the risk appetite statement and supporting risk tolerance levels via a series of established metrics and evaluate monitor and oversee the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management framework and risk appetite framework the board risk committee also reviews reports of examination by and communications from regulatory agencies the results of internal and third party testing and qualitative and quantitative assessments related to risk management and any other matters within the scope of the committees oversight responsibilities the board risk committee monitors managements response to certain riskrelated regulatory and audit issues in addition the board risk committee may coordinate with the audit committee and the compensation nominations and governance committee for the review of financial statements and related risks information security and other areas of joint responsibility in combination with other risk management and monitoring practices enterprisewide stress testing activities are part of the risk management framework and conducted within a defined framework stress tests are performed for various risks to ensure the financial institution can support continued operations during stressed periods enactment of the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act in may significantly altered several provisions of the doddfrank act including how stress tests are run bank holding companies with assets of less than billion such as bancshares are no longer subject to companyrun stress testing requirements in section 165i2 of the doddfrank act including publishing a summary of results however bancshares will continue to monitor and stress test its capital and liquidity consistent with the safety and soundness expectations of the federal regulators credit risk management credit risk is the risk of not collecting payments pursuant to the contractual terms of loans leases and certain investment securities loans and leases we originate are underwritten in accordance with our credit policies and procedures and are subject to periodic ongoing reviews acquired loans regardless of whether pcd or nonpcd are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date and are subject to periodic reviews to identify any further credit deterioration our independent credit review function conducts risk reviews and analyses of both originated and acquired loans to ensure compliance with credit policies and to monitor asset quality trends and borrower financial strength these reviews include portfolio analysis by geographic location industry collateral type and product we strive to identify potential problem loans as early as possible to record chargeoffs or writedowns as appropriate and to maintain an adequate acl that accounts for losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio we are actively monitoring our loan portfolio for areas of increased risk as a result of covid19 as of december covid19 related loan extensions decreased to approximately million in outstanding loan balances representing approximately million in payment deferrals through december over of all covid19 related loan extensions have begun repayment delinquency trends among loans entering repayment are in line with the remainder of the portfolio we have not seen significant declines in overall credit quality though the impact of the sbappp and payment extensions could be delaying signs of credit deterioration additionally we are participating in the sbappp program which provided much needed funds to our existing small business customers and we continue to assess both the credit and operational risks this program presents bancshares originated approximately sbappp loans with an outstanding balance of billion at december our acl estimate for the year ended december included extensive reviews of the changes in credit risk associated with the uncertainties around economic forecasts and the overall economic impact of covid19 expected loss estimates within each portfolio considered the potential impact of slower economic activity with elevated unemployment as well as potential mitigating impact from the government stimulus and loan modification programs these loss estimates additionally considered bancshares industry risk historically strong credit quality and actual net losses incurred during prior periods of economic stress as well as recent credit trends which have not seen significant deterioration from covid19 as of december we maintain a welldiversified loan and lease portfolio and seek to minimize the risks associated with large concentrations within specific geographic areas collateral types or industries despite our focus on diversification several characteristics of our loan portfolio subject us to significant risk such as our concentrations of real estate secured loans revolving mortgage loans and medical and dentalrelated loans we have historically carried a significant concentration of real estate secured loans but actively mitigate exposure through underwriting policies which primarily rely on borrower cash flow rather than underlying collateral values when we do rely on underlying real property values we favor financing secured by owneroccupied real property and as a result a large percentage of our real estate secured loans are owner occupied at december loans secured by real estate were billion or of total loans and leases compared to billion or at december and billion or at december similar to our branch footprint the collateral of loans secured by real estate is concentrated within north carolina and south carolina at december real estate located in north carolina and south carolina represented and

december collateral location percent of real estate secured loans with collateral located in the state north carolina south carolina california florida georgia virginia washington texas tennessee all other locations table end among real estate secured loans our revolving mortgage loans home equity lines of credit or helocs present a heightened risk due to long commitment periods during which the financial position of individual borrowers or collateral values may deteriorate significantly in addition a large percentage of our helocs are secured by junior liens substantial declines in collateral values could cause junior lien positions to become effectively unsecured helocs secured by real estate were billion or of total loans at december compared to billion or at december and billion or at december except for loans acquired through mergers and acquisitions we have not purchased helocs in the secondary market nor have we originated these loans to customers outside of our market areas all originated helocs were underwritten by us based on our standard lending criteria the heloc portfolio consists of variable rate lines of credit which allow customer draws during a specified period of the line of credit with a portion switching to an amortizing term following the draw period approximately of the revolving mortgage portfolio relates to properties in north carolina and south carolina approximately of the loan balances outstanding are secured by senior collateral positions while the remaining are secured by junior liens we actively monitor the portion of our helocs in the interestonly period and when they will mature approximately of outstanding balances at december require interestonly payments while the remaining require monthly payments equal to the greater of of the outstanding balance or when helocs switch from interestonly to fully amortizing including principal and interest some borrowers may not be able to afford the higher monthly payments we have not experienced a significant increase in defaults as a result of these increased payments in the normal course of business the bank will work with each borrower as they approach the revolving period maturity date to discuss options for refinance or repayment loans and leases to borrowers in medical dental or related fields were billion as of december which represents of total loans and leases compared to billion or of total loans and leases at december and billion or of total loans and leases at december the credit risk of this industry concentration is mitigated through our underwriting policies which emphasize reliance on adequate borrower cash flow rather than underlying collateral value and our preference for financing secured by owneroccupied real property except for this single concentration no other industry represented more than of total loans and leases outstanding at december interest rate risk management interest rate risk irr results principally from assets and liabilities maturing or repricing at different points in time assets and liabilities repricing at the same point in time but in different amounts and shortterm and longterm interest rates changing in different magnitudes we assess our shortterm irr by forecasting net interest income over months under various interest rate scenarios and comparing those results to forecasted net interest income assuming stable rates irr scenarios modeled include but are not limited to immediate parallel rate shocks interest rate ramps changes in the shape of the yield curve and changes in the relationships of our rates to market rates table provides the impact on net interest income over months resulting from various instantaneous interest rate shock scenarios as of december and table net income sensitivity simulation analysis table start estimated decrease increase in net interest income change in interest rate basis points december december table end net interest income sensitivity metrics at december compared to december were primarily affected by an influx of nonmaturity deposits during the year following the onset of the covid19 pandemic which helped boost overnight investments and improve sensitivity to rising interest rate shocks longterm interest rate risk exposure is measured using the economic value of equity eve sensitivity analysis to study the impact of longterm cash flows on earnings and capital eve represents the difference between the sum of the present value of all asset cash flows and the sum of the present value of the liability cash flows eve sensitivity analysis involves discounting cash flows under different interest rate scenarios the basecase measurement and its sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve allow management to measure longerterm repricing and option risk in the balance sheet table presents the eve profile as of december and table economic value of equity modeling analysis table start estimated decrease increase in eve change in interest rate basis points december december table end the economic value of equity metrics at december compared to december saw improvement when measured against moderate rising rate

obtain sufficient cash or its equivalents on a costeffective basis to meet commitments as they fall due the most common sources of liquidity risk arise from mismatches in the timing and value of onbalance sheet and offbalance sheet cash inflows and outflows in general onbalance sheet mismatches generate liquidity risk when the effective maturity of assets exceeds the effective maturity of liabilities a commonly cited example of a balance sheet liquidity mismatch is when longterm loans assets are funded with shortterm borrowings liabilities other forms of liquidity risk include market constraints on the ability to convert assets into cash at expected levels an inability to access funding sources at sufficient levels at a reasonable cost and changes in economic conditions or exposure to credit market operational legal and reputation risks affecting an institutions liquidity risk profile we utilize various limitbased measures to monitor measure and control liquidity risk across three different types of liquidity tactical measures the risk of a negative cash flow position whereby cash outflows exceed cash inflows over a shortterm horizon out to nine weeks structural measures the amount by which illiquid assets are supported by longterm funding and contingent measures the risk of having insufficient liquidity sources to support cash needs under potential future stressed market conditions or having an inability to access wholesale funding sources in a timely and cost effective manner we aim to maintain a diverse mix of liquidity sources to support the liquidity management function while aiming to avoid funding concentrations by diversifying our external funding with respect to maturities counterparties and nature our primary source of liquidity is our branchgenerated deposit portfolio due to the generally stable balances and low cost additional sources include cash in excess of our reserve requirement at the federal reserve bank and various other correspondent bank accounts and unencumbered securities which totaled billion at december compared to billion at december another source of available funds is advances from the fhlb of atlanta and chicago outstanding fhlb advances were million as of december and we had sufficient collateral pledged to secure billion of additional borrowings further in the current year billion in nonpcd loans with a lendable collateral value of billion were used to create additional borrowing capacity at the federal reserve bank we also maintain federal funds and other credit lines which had million of available capacity at december fourth quarter analysis for the quarter ended december net income was million compared to million for the corresponding quarter of an increase of million or the increase was primarily the result of higher net interest income higher noninterest income and lower provision expense partially offset by higher noninterest expense earnings per share were for the fourth quarter of compared to for the same period a year ago net interest income was million an increase of million or compared to the fourth quarter of the increase was primarily due to higher loan interest income driven by sbappp loans and organic loan growth and lower rates paid on interestbearing liabilities sbappp loans contributed million in interest and fee income during the quarter this favorable impact was partially offset by a decline in investment securities interest income as a result of lower yields the taxableequivalent net interest margin for the fourth quarter of was a decrease of basis points from in the same quarter in the prior year the margin decline was primarily due to a lower yield on interestearning assets partially offset by a decline in rates paid on deposits and borrowings income tax expense was million in the fourth quarter of up from million in the fourth quarter of the increase in income tax expense was a result of higher gross earnings partially offset by a million decrease due to bancshares decision to utilize an allowable alternative for computing its federal income tax liability an allowable alternative provides bancshares the ability to use the federal income tax rate for certain current year deductible amounts related to prior year fdicassisted acquisitions that was applicable when these amounts were originally subjected to tax the effective tax rates were and during each of these respective periods without the alternative the effective tax rate would have been approximately for the fourth quarter provision for credit losses was million during the fourth quarter of compared to million for the fourth quarter of the million decrease was primarily due to limited movement in credit quality metrics and continued low net chargeoffs the net chargeoff ratio was for the fourth quarter of compared to for the fourth quarter of noninterest income was million for the fourth quarter of an increase of million from the same period of the increase was primarily driven by an million increase in marketable equity securities gains a million increase in mortgage income and a million increase in gain on sale of investment securities available for sale these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in service charges on deposit accounts noninterest expense was million for the fourth quarter of an increase of million from the same quarter last year largely due to an million increase in personnel expense primarily related to merit increases as well as personnel additions from acquisitions a million increase in occupancy expense primarily due to enhanced cleaning and sanitation efforts in response to the covid19 pandemic and a million increase in processing fees paid to third parties

credit losses expected over the life of the loan adjusted for expected contractual payments and estimated prepayments loans within the various reporting classes are segregated into pools with similar risk characteristics and each have a model that is utilized to estimate the acl these models estimate the probability of default and loss given default for individual loans within each pool based on historical loss experience borrower characteristics collateral type forecasts of relevant economic conditions expected future recoveries and other factors the company uses a twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period which incorporates macroeconomic forecasts significant economic factors used in estimating the expected losses include unemployment gross domestic product home price and commercial real estate indices a twelve month straightline reversion period to historical averages is used for model inputs however for the commercial card and certain consumer portfolios immediate reversion to historical net loss rates is utilized model outputs may be adjusted through a qualitative assessment to reflect economic conditions and trends not captured within the models including credit quality concentrations and significant policy and underwriting changes we identified the acl for loans and leases as a critical audit matter the principal considerations for our determination of the acl for loans and leases as a critical audit matter includes the subjectivity complexity and estimation uncertainty involved in determining significant model assumptions and adjusting model outputs to reflect economic and portfolio trends and conditions not captured within the models this required a high degree of auditor effort including specialized skills and knowledge and subjective

all loans are classified as past due when the payment of principal and interest based upon contractual terms is days or greater delinquent loans are generally placed on nonaccrual when principal or interest becomes days past due or when it is probable the principal or interest is not fully collectible when loans are placed on nonaccrual all previously uncollected accrued interest is reversed from interest income and the ongoing accrual of interest is discontinued all payments received thereafter are applied as a reduction of the remaining principal balance as long as doubt exists as to the ultimate collection of the principal loans and leases are generally removed from nonaccrual status when they become current for a sustained period of time and there is no longer concern as to the collectability of principal and interest debt securities are also classified as past due when the payment of principal and interest based upon contractual terms is days delinquent or greater missed interest payments on debt securities are rare we review all debt securities with delinquent interest and immediately charge off any accrued interest determined to be uncollectible troubled debt restructurings a loan is considered a troubled debt restructuring tdr when both a modification to a borrowers debt agreement is made and a concession is granted for economic or legal reasons related to a borrowers financial difficulties that otherwise would not be granted tdr concessions could include shortterm deferrals of interest modifications of payment terms or in certain limited instances forgiveness of principal or interest loans restructured as a tdr are treated and reported as such for the remaining life of the loan tdr loans can be nonaccrual or accrual depending on the individual facts and circumstances of the borrower in circumstances where a portion of the loan balance is chargedoff the remaining balance is typically classified as nonaccrual allowance for credit losses loans loans within the various reporting classes are segregated into pools with similar risk characteristics and models are built to estimate the acl these loan level acl models estimate the probability of default and loss given default for individual loans within the risk pool based on historical loss experience borrower characteristics collateral type forecasts of relevant economic conditions expected future recoveries and other factors pools for estimating the acl are aggregated into loan classes as described above which roll up into commercial and consumer loan segments nonpcd and pcd loans are modeled together within the loan level models using acquired and pcd indicator variables to provide differentiation of individual loan risk bancshares uses a two year reasonable and supportable forecast period which incorporates economic forecasts at the time of evaluation for most pools bancshares uses a 12month straightline reversion period to historical averages for model inputs however for the consumer other consumer card and commercial card pools immediate reversion to historical net loss rates is utilized the acl for sbappp loans originated during are separately evaluated given the explicit government guarantee this analysis which incorporated historical experience with similar sba guarantees and underwriting concluded the likelihood of loss was remote and therefore these loans were assigned a zero expected credit loss in the acl the acl represents managements best estimate of credit losses expected over the life of the loan adjusted for expected contractual payments and the impact of prepayment expectations prepayment assumptions were developed through a review of bancshares historical prepayment activity and began with a review of prepayment assumptions utilized in other modeling activities estimates for loan losses are determined by analyzing quantitative and qualitative components present as of the evaluation date adjustments to the acl are recorded with a corresponding entry to provision for credit losses loan balances considered uncollectible are chargedoff against the acl recoveries of amounts previously chargedoff are credited to the acl a primary component of determining the acl on loans is the actual net loss history of the various loan pools for commercial pools key factors utilized in the models include delinquency trends as well as macroeconomic variables such as unemployment and commercial real estate price index for consumer pools key factors include delinquency trends and the borrowers original credit score as well as other macroeconomic variables such as unemployment gross domestic product home price index and commercial real estate index as the models project losses over the life of the loans prepayment assumptions also serve as first citizens bancshares inc and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements continued inputs model outputs may be adjusted through a qualitative assessment to reflect economic conditions and trends not captured within the models including credit quality concentrations and significant policy and underwriting changes within our acl model tdrs meet the definition of default and are given a probability of default rating tdrs are not individually evaluated unless determined to be collateraldependent therefore loss given default is calculated based on the individual risk characteristics of the loan as defined in the model when loans do not share risk characteristics similar to others in the pool the acl is evaluated on an individual basis given that bancshares cecl models are loan level models the population of loans evaluated individually is minimal and consists primarily of loans greater than thousand and determined to be collateraldependent bancshares elected the practical expedient allowed under asc to assess the collectability of these loans where repayment is expected to be provided substantially through operation or sale of collateral based on the fair value of the underlying collateral the fair value of the collateral is estimated using appraised and market values appropriately adjusted for an assessment of the sales and marketing costs when applicable a specific allowance is established or partial chargeoff is recorded for the difference between the excess amortized cost of loan and the collaterals estimated fair value accrued interest receivable bancshares has elected not to measure an acl for accrued interest receivable and has excluded it from the amortized cost basis of loans and held to maturity debt securities as our accounting policies and credit monitoring provide that uncollectible accrued interest is reversed or written off against interest income in a timely manner unfunded commitments a reserve for unfunded commitments is established for offbalance sheet exposures such as unfunded balances for existing lines of credit commitments to extend future credit as well as both standby and commercial letters of credit when there is a contractual obligation to extend credit and when this extension of credit is not unconditionally cancellable ie commitment cannot be canceled at any time these unfunded commitments are assessed to determine both the probability of funding as well the expectation of future losses the expected funding balance is used in the probability of default and loss given default models to determine the reserve the reserve for unfunded commitments was million at december and is recorded within other liabilities with changes recorded through other noninterest expense other real estate owned other real estate owned oreo includes foreclosed real estate property and closed branch properties and is initially recorded at the assets estimated fair value less costs to sell any excess in the recorded investment in the loan over the estimated fair value less costs to sell is chargedoff against the acl at the time of foreclosure if the estimated value of the oreo exceeds the recorded investment of the loan the difference is recorded as a gain within other income oreo is subsequently carried at the lower of cost or market value less estimated selling costs and is evaluated at least annually the periodic evaluations are generally based on the appraised value of the property and may include additional adjustments based upon managements review of the valuation estimate and

methods and assumptions actuarial assumptions used in the determination of future values of plan assets and liabilities are subject to management judgment and may differ significantly if different assumptions are used all assumptions are reviewed annually for appropriateness the discount rate assumption used to measure the plan obligations is based on a yield curve developed from highquality corporate bonds across a full maturity spectrum the projected cash flows of the pension plans are discounted based on this yield curve and a single discount rate is calculated to achieve the same present value the assumed rate of future compensation increases is based on actual experience and future salary expectations we also estimate a longterm rate of return on pension plan assets used to

capital and capital ratios was not significant and we did not elect the capital phasein option allowable for regulatory reporting purposes there was no acl recorded on debt securities held to maturity at adoption the largest changes in the acl affecting beginning retained earnings as a result of the adoption were decreases in the acl on commercial loan segments as these portfolios have exhibited strong historical credit performance and have relatively short average lives the reduction in acl on these segments was partially offset by increases in acl on our consumer loan segments primarily due to their longer average lives the increase in the reserve for unfunded commitments was primarily due to increases in the scope of offbalance sheet exposures considered in this estimate due to the

characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable on the basis of currently existing facts conditions and values loss assets classified as

portfolios have exhibited strong historical credit performance and have relatively short average lives the reduction in acl on these segments was partially offset by increases in acl on our consumer loan segments primarily due to their longer average lives the increase in the acl on pcd loans was primarily the result of reallocating credit discount from loan balances into acl the acl is calculated using a variety of factors including but not limited to chargeoff and recovery activity loan growth changes in macroeconomic factors collateral type estimated loan life and changes in credit quality for the period ended december the primary reason for the acl change since the adoption of asc was a million reserve build due to the potential economic impact of covid19 and its

assumptions revert to long term historic averages over a one year period significant macroeconomic factors used in estimating the expected losses include unemployment gross domestic product home price

composition andor risk within the loan portfolio adjustments to the alll were recorded with a corresponding entry to provision for loan and lease losses loan balances considered uncollectible were chargedoff against the alll recoveries of amounts previously chargedoff were generally credited to the alll a primary component of determining the allowance on nonpci loans collectively evaluated was the actual loss history of the various loan classes loan loss factors were based on historical experience and when necessary were adjusted for significant factors that in managements judgment affect the collectability of principal and interest at the balance sheet date loan loss factors were monitored quarterly and when necessary adjusted based on changes in the level of historical net chargeoffs and updates by management such as the number of periods included in the calculation of loss factors loss severity loss emergence period and portfolio attrition for commercial nonpci loans management incorporated historical net loss data to develop the applicable loan loss factors general reserves for collective impairment were based on incurred loss estimates for the loan class based on average loss rates by credit quality indicators which were estimated using historical loss experience and credit risk rating migrations credit quality indicators include borrower classification codes and facility risk ratings incurred loss estimates were adjusted through a qualitative assessment to reflect current economic conditions and portfolio trends including credit quality concentrations aging of the portfolio and significant policy and underwriting changes for noncommercial nonpci loans management incorporated specific loan class and delinquency status trends into the loan loss factors general reserve estimates of incurred losses were based on historical loss experience and the migration of loans through the various delinquency pools applied to the current risk mix nonpci loans were considered to be impaired when based on current information and events it was probable that a borrower would be unable to pay all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement generally management considered the following loans to be impaired all tdr loans and all loan relationships which were on nonaccrual or days past due and greater than nonpci impaired loans greater than were evaluated individually for impairment while others were evaluated collectively the impairment assessment and determination of the related specific reserve for each impaired loan was based on the loans characteristics impairment measurement for loans dependent on borrower cash flow for repayment was based on the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the interest rate implicit in the original loan agreement impairment measurement for most real estate loans particularly when a loan was considered to be a probable foreclosure was based on the fair value of the underlying collateral collateral was appraised and market value appropriately adjusted for an assessment of the sales and marketing costs was used to calculate a fair value estimate a specific valuation

would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date bancshares estimates fair value using discounted cash flows or other valuation techniques when there is no active market for a financial instrument inputs used in these valuation techniques are subjective in nature involve uncertainties and require significant judgment therefore the derived fair value estimates presented below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts bancshares would realize in a current market exchange assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value according to a fair value hierarchy comprised of three levels the levels are based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value the level within the fair value hierarchy for an asset or liability is based on the lowest level of input significant to the fair value measurement with level inputs considered highest and level inputs considered lowest a brief description of each input level follows level inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities level inputs are quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and inputs other than quoted prices observable for the assets or liabilities and market corroborated inputs level inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability these unobservable inputs and assumptions reflect the estimates market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability bancshares management reviews any changes to its valuation methodologies to ensure they are appropriate and supportable and refines valuation methodologies as more marketbased data becomes available transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are recognized at the end of the reporting period the methodologies used to estimate the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities are discussed below investment securities available for sale the fair value of us treasury government agency mortgagebacked and municipal securities and a portion of our corporate bonds are generally estimated using a third party pricing service the third party provider evaluates securities based on comparable investments with trades and market data and will utilize pricing models which use a variety of inputs such as benchmark yields reported trades issuer spreads benchmark securities bids and offers as needed these securities are generally classified as level the remaining corporate bonds held are generally measured at fair value based on indicative bids from brokerdealers using inputs that are not directly observable these securities are considered level marketable equity securities equity securities are measured at fair value using observable closing prices the valuation also considers the amount of market activity by examining the trade volume of each security equity securities are classified as level if they are traded in an active market and as level if the observable closing price is from a less than active market loans held for sale certain residential real estate loans originated to be sold to investors are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices for similar types of loans accordingly the inputs used to calculate fair value of originated residential real estate loans held for sale are considered level inputs portfolio loans subsequently transferred to held for sale to be sold in the secondary market are transferred at fair value the fair value of the transferred portfolio loans is based on quoted prices and considered level inputs net loans and leases nonpcd and pcd fair value is estimated based on discounted future cash flows using the current interest rates at which loans with similar terms would be made to borrowers of similar credit quality the inputs used in the fair value measurements for loans and leases are considered level inputs first citizens bancshares inc and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements continued fhlb stock the carrying amount of fhlb stock is a reasonable estimate of fair value as these securities are not readily marketable and are evaluated for impairment based on the ultimate recoverability of the par value bancshares considers positive and negative evidence including the profitability and asset quality of the issuer dividend payment history and recent redemption experience when determining the ultimate recoverability of the par value bancshares investment in fhlb stock is ultimately recoverable at par the inputs used in the fair value measurement for the fhlb stock are considered level inputs mortgage and other servicing rights mortgage and other servicing rights are carried at the lower of amortized cost or market and are therefore carried at fair value only when fair value is less than the amortized cost the fair value of mortgage and other servicing rights is performed using a pooling methodology similar loans are pooled together and a model which relies on discount rates estimates of prepayment rates and the weighted average cost to service the loans is used to determine the fair value the inputs used in the fair value measurement for mortgage and other servicing rights are considered level inputs deposits for deposits with no stated maturity the carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value the fair value of time deposits is estimated by discounting future cash flows using the interest rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities the inputs used in the fair value measurement for deposits are considered level inputs borrowings for borrowings the fair values are determined based on recent trades or sales of the actual security if available otherwise fair values are estimated by discounting future cash flows using current interest rates for similar financial instruments the inputs used in the fair value measurement for fhlb borrowings subordinated debentures and other borrowings are considered level inputs payable to the fdic for sharedloss agreements the fair value of the payable to the fdic for sharedloss agreements is determined by the projected cash flows based on expected payments to the fdic in accordance with the sharedloss agreements cash flows are discounted using current discount rates to reflect the timing of the estimated amounts due to the fdic the inputs used in the fair value measurement for the payable to the fdic are considered level inputs offbalancesheet commitments and contingencies carrying amounts are reasonable estimates of the fair values for such financial instruments carrying amounts include unamortized fee income and in some cases reserves for any credit losses from those financial instruments these amounts are not material to bancshares financial position for all other financial assets and financial liabilities the carrying value is a reasonable estimate of the fair value as of december and the carrying value and fair value for these assets and liabilities are equivalent because they are relatively shortterm in nature and there is no interest rate or credit risk that would cause the fair value to
