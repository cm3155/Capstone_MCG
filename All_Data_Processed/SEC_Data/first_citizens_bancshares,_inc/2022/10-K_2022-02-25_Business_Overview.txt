services industry is highly competitive bancshares competes with national regional and local financial services providers in recent years the ability of nonbank financial entities to provide services has intensified competition nonbank financial service providers are not subject to the same significant regulatory restrictions as traditional commercial banks more than ever customers have the ability to select from a variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives competition is based on a number of factors including among others customer service quality and range of products and services offered price reputation interest rates on loans and deposits and customer convenience as of december fcbs primary deposit markets are north carolina and south carolina which represent

branch offices socialdistancing protocols and limitations on inperson meeting and other gatherings regulatory considerations various laws and regulations administered by regulatory agencies affect bancshares corporate practices including the payment of dividends the incurrence of debt and the acquisition of financial institutions and other companies laws and regulations also affect business practices such as the payment of interest on deposits the charging of interest on loans the types of business conducted and the location of offices certain subsidiaries of the parent company and fcb are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the securities and exchange commission sec the financial industry regulatory authority finra state regulatory agencies and other regulatory authorities as regulated entities fcbs insurance activities are subject to licensing and regulation by state insurance regulatory agencies in general numerous statutes and regulations also apply to and restrict the activities of bancshares including limitations on the ability to pay dividends capital requirements reserve requirements deposit insurance requirements and restrictions on transactions with related persons and entities controlled by related persons the impact of these statutes and regulations is discussed below and in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as a result of the consummation of the cit merger bancshares has over billion in total consolidated assets and is expected to be subject to certain enhanced prudential standards and enhanced oversight under the applicable transition provisions of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act by the federal reserve board federal reserve or frb and the fdic with respect to fcb as bancshares continues to grow bancshares and fcb could become subject to additional regulatory requirements based on the tailored regulatory framework applicable to banking organizations with billion or more in total assets and adopted by the federal banking agencies pursuant to the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act the egrrcpa in connection with the cit merger fcb established as a whollyowned subsidiary fc international inc fc international which is a corporation chartered by the federal reserve pursuant to section of the federal reserve act edge act and the federal reserves regulation k edge act corporations are international banking organizations that are authorized to engage in international banking and foreign financial transactions fcb established fc international for the purpose of holding the equity interests in the foreign nonbank subsidiaries foreign companies that fcb acquired in the cit merger certain of the foreign companies are in the process of being wounddown or dissolved the other foreign companies acquired by fcb support the railcar leasing business acquired from cit in canada and mexico fc international is subject to supervision and regulation by the federal reserve including examination reporting capital and bank secrecy act of bsa and antimoney laundering aml requirements pursuant to the edge act and the federal reserves regulation k fc internationals home office is the same as the home office the parent company and fcb fc international will not have a physical presence outside of the united states and therefore bancshares is evaluating whether fc international will be subject to any regulatory requirements with respect to its direct ownership of the equity interests of the foreign companies doddfrank act the doddfrank act enacted in significantly restructured the financial services regulatory environment imposed significant regulatory and compliance changes increased capital leverage and liquidity requirements and expanded the scope of oversight responsibility of certain federal agencies through the creation of new oversight bodies for example the doddfrank act established the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer financial protection laws egrrcpa enacted in the egrrcpa while largely preserving the fundamental elements of the postdoddfrank act regulatory framework modified certain requirements of the doddfrank act as they applied to regional and community banking organizations certain of the significant requirements of the doddfrank act are listed below with information regarding how they apply to bancshares following the enactment of the egrrcpa asset threshold for applicability of doddfrank act enhanced prudential standards and enhanced supervision the doddfrank act mandated the applicability of enhanced prudential standards including enhanced liquidity and capital requirements enterprisewide risk management requirements concentration limits resolution plans and credit exposure report requirements etc and enhanced supervision of bank holding companies with billion or more in assets the egrrcpa raised the asset threshold for mandatory applicability of enhanced prudential standards to billion or more in total consolidated assets and gives the federal reserve board the discretion to apply any enhanced prudential standards to banking organizations with billion or more in total assets on a tailored basis based on asset size and other riskrelated factors to prevent or mitigate risks to the financial stability of the united states or to promote the safety and soundness of a bank holding company in november the federal reserve board along with the fdic and the office of the comptroller of the currency the occ adopted a framework for tailoring the applicability of enhanced prudential standards for banking organizations with billion or more in assets the tailoring rules the tailoring rules are further discussed below capital planning and stress testing the doddfrank act mandated stress tests be developed and performed by banking organizations with billion or more in total assets to ensure financial institutions have sufficient capital to absorb losses and support operations during multiple economic and bank scenarios the egrrcpa gave immediate relief from doddfrank act and companyrun stress testing for banking organizations with less than billion in total consolidated assets therefore bancshares is not subject to doddfrank act companyrun stress testing until such time that it has billion or more in total assets notwithstanding these amendments to the stress testing requirements the federal banking agencies indicated through interagency guidance the capital planning and risk management practices of institutions with total assets less than billion would continue to be reviewed through the regular supervisory process including through the federal reserves comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar for banking organizations with billion or more in total assets as a result of the consummation of the cit merger bancshares has over billion in total consolidated assets and we expect to be subject to supervisory stress testing by the federal reserve under the ccar process as a category iv banking organization in accordance with the applicable transition provisions bancshares has made substantial progress in developing policies programs and systems designed to comply with capital planning and stress testing requirements the volcker rule the volcker rule was promulgated to implement provisions of the doddfrank act it prohibits banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring hedge funds and private equity funds the egrrcpa exempted many financial institutions with total consolidated assets of less than billion from the volcker rule but it continues to apply to bancshares however the volcker rule does not significantly impact our operations as we do not have any significant engagement in the businesses it prohibits abilitytorepay and qualified mortgage rule creditors are required to comply with mortgage reform provisions prohibiting the origination of any residential mortgages that do not meet rigorous qualified mortgage standards or abilitytorepay standards all mortgage loans originated by fcb meet abilitytorepay standards and a substantial majority also meet qualified mortgage standards the egrrcpa impact on the original abilitytorepay and qualified mortgage standards is only applicable to banks with less than billion in total consolidated assets reciprocal deposits are not treated as brokered deposits section of the federal deposit insurance act the fdi act and the fdics implementing regulations limit the ability of an insured depository institution to accept brokered deposits unless the institution is wellcapitalized under the prompt corrective action under the fdi act or the insured depository institution is adequately capitalized and obtains a waiver from the fdic insured depository institutions that are less than wellcapitalized are not able to accept brokered deposits and are subject to restrictions on the interest rates paid on deposits in addition deposits that are considered brokered are subject to higher deposit assessments egrrcpa amended the fdi act to add a limited exception under which insured depository institutions that are wellcapitalized or adequately capitalized and meet certain other criteria are able to exempt from treatment as brokered deposits up to billion or percent of the institutions total liabilities in reciprocal deposits defined generally as deposits received by a depository institution through a deposit placement network with the same maturity and in the same aggregate amount as deposits placed by the depository institution in other network institutions in addition in december the fdic amended its regulations governing brokered deposits to clarify and modernize this regulatory framework notable aspects of the final rule include the establishment of brightline standards for determining whether an entity meets the statutory definition of deposit broker the identification of a number of business relationships that qualify for the primary purpose exception for agents to avoid being deemed a deposit broker for the placement of funds with depository institutions the establishment of a more transparent application process for entities that seek to rely upon the primary purpose exception but do not qualify for one of the identified exceptions for business relationships deemed to satisfy the primary purpose exception and the clarification that third parties that have an exclusive depositplacement arrangement with one insured depository institution are not considered a deposit broker the final rule became effective april with full compliance

categories based on asset size offbalance sheet exposure nonbank assets weighted shortterm wholesale funding and crossjurisdictional activities category i banking organizations ie large banks that have been designated as global systemically important banks are subject to the most stringent enhanced prudential requirements and category iv banking organizations ie between billion and billion in total consolidated assets and less than billion in nonbank assets offbalance sheet exposure crossjurisdictional activities and weighted shortterm wholesale funding are subject to the least stringent requirements as a result of the cit merger bancshares has total consolidated assets in excess of billion and therefore expects to be required to comply with certain enhanced prudential standards applicable to category iv banking organizations subject to the applicable transition periods in planning for the cit merger bancshares developed policies programs and systems designed to meet such enhanced prudential standards including annual capital plan submissions and supervisory stress testing by the federal reserve under ccar enhanced enterprisewide risk management requirements and enhanced liquidity management requirements including liquidity stress tests and liquidity buffer requirements in the event bancshares assets grow to meet or exceed the thresholds for the asset size or other riskbased factors bancshares will be subject to other enhanced prudential standards on a tailored basis for example if bancshares has billion or more in weighted shortterm wholesale funding it will be subject to modified liquidity coverage ratio lcr and net stable funding ratio nsfr requirements in the event bancshares becomes a category iii banking organization bancshares will be subject

in item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations subject to its capital requirements and certain other restrictions the parent company is able to borrow money to make capital contributions to fcb and such loans may be repaid from dividends paid by fcb to the parent company as a result of the cit merger bancshares expects to be a category iv banking organization and expects to be required to submit an annual capital plan to the federal reserve in accordance with the applicable transition provisions bancshares will also be subject to biennial supervisory stress testing under the federal reserves ccar process and the stress capital buffer calculated by the federal reserve under ccar will replace the static percent component of our capital

common share repurchases additionally under the fdi act insured depository institutions such as fcb are prohibited from making capital distributions including the payment of dividends if after making such distributions the institution would become undercapitalized as such term is used in the statute additionally under basel iii capital guidelines banking institutions with a regulatory capital

final rules related to qm loans the first rule replaces the strict dti threshold for qm loans and provides that in addition to existing requirements a loan receives a conclusive presumption that the consumer had the ability to repay if the apr does not exceed the average prime offer rate for a comparable transaction by percentage points or more as of the date the interest rate is set further a loan receives a rebuttable presumption that the consumer had the ability to repay if the apr exceeds the average prime offer rate for a comparable transaction by percentage points or more but by less than percentage points the second rule creates a new category of seasoned qms for loans that meet certain performance requirements that rule allows a nonqm loan or a rebuttable presumption qm loan to receive a safe harbor from atr liability at the end of a seasoning period of at least months as a seasoned qm if it satisfies certain product restrictions pointsandfees limits and underwriting requirements and the loan meets the designated performance and portfolio requirements during the seasoning period the mandatory compliance date under the first final rule was july but subsequently was delayed by the cfpb to october the second final rule will apply to covered transactions for which institutions receive an application after the compliance date for the first final rule additionally the cfpb has the authority to take supervisory and enforcement action against banks and other financial services companies under the agencys jurisdiction that fail to comply with federal consumer financial laws as an insured depository institution with total assets of more than billion fcb is subject to the cfpbs supervisory and enforcement authorities the doddfrank act also permits states to adopt stricter consumer protection laws and state attorneys general to enforce consumer protection rules issued by the cfpb as a result of these aspects of the doddfrank act fcb operates in a stringent consumer compliance environment the cfpb has been active in bringing enforcement actions against banks and other financial institutions to enforce consumer financial laws the federal financial regulatory agencies including the fdic and states attorneys general also have become increasingly active in this area with respect to institutions over which they have jurisdiction pursuant to the doddfrank act the fdic has backup enforcement authority over a depository institution holding company such as the parent company if the conduct or threatened conduct of such holding company poses a risk to the depositors insurance fund dif although such authority may not be used if the holding company is generally in sound condition and does not pose a foreseeable and material risk to the dif the doddfrank act may have a material impact on bancshares operations particularly through increased compliance costs resulting from possible future consumer and fair lending regulations refer to item risk factors below for a more extensive discussion of this topic other regulations applicable to the parent company and fcb privacy data protection and cybersecurity we are subject to a number of us federal state local and foreign laws and regulations relating to consumer privacy and data protection under privacy protection provisions of the grammleachbliley act of glba and its implementing regulations and guidance we are limited in our ability to disclose certain nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties financial institutions such as us are required by statute and regulation to notify consumers of their privacy policies and practices and in some circumstances allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party in addition such financial institutions must appropriately safeguard their customers nonpublic personal information consumers must be notified in the event of a data breach under applicable state laws the changing privacy laws in the united states europe and elsewhere including the california consumer privacy act of the ccpa which became effective on january applies to

or disclosed pursuant to the glba in november voters in the state of california approved the california privacy rights act cpra a ballot measure that amends and supplements the ccpa by creating the california privacy protection agency a watchdog privacy agency to be appointed shortly after the cpras enactment the cpra also modifies the ccpa by expanding both the scope of businesses covered by the law and certain rights relating to personal information and its use collection and disclosure by covered businesses similar laws have and may be adopted by other states where bancshares does business in addition multiple other states congress and regulators outside the united states are considering similar laws or regulations which could create new individual privacy rights and impose increased obligations on companies handling personal data for example on november the federal financial regulatory agencies published a final rule that will impose upon banking organizations and their service providers new notification requirements for significant cybersecurity incidents the cybersecurity rule specifically the cybersecurity rule requires banking organizations to notify their primary federal regulator as soon as possible and no later than hours after the discovery of a computersecurity incident that rises to the level of a notification incident within the meaning attributed to those terms by the cybersecurity rule banks service providers are required under the cybersecurity rule to notify any affected bank to or on behalf of which the service provider provides services as soon as possible after determining that it has experienced an incident that materially disrupts or degrades or is reasonably likely to materially disrupt or degrade covered services provided to such bank for as much as four hours the cybersecurity rule will take effect on april and banks and their service providers must be in compliance with the requirements by may we are actively working on updating processes to ensure compliance federal banking agencies including the fdic have adopted guidelines for establishing information security standards and cybersecurity programs for implementing safeguards under the supervision of the board of directors these guidelines along with related regulatory materials increasingly focus on risk management and processes related to information technology and the use of third parties in the provision of financial services in october the federal banking agencies issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on enhanced cybersecurity riskmanagement and resilience standards that would apply to large and interconnected banking organizations and to services provided by third parties to these firms if adopted these enhanced standards will apply to depository institutions and depository institution holding companies with total consolidated assets of billion or more which includes the parent company and fcb climaterelated regulation and risk management in recent years the federal banking agencies have increased their focus on climaterelated risks impacting the operations of banks the communities they serve and the broader financial system accordingly the agencies have begun to enhance their supervisory expectations regarding the climate risk management practices of larger banking organizations such as bancshares including by encouraging such banks to ensure that management of climaterelated risk exposures has been incorporated into existing governance structures evaluate the potential impact of climaterelated risks on the banks financial condition operations and business objectives as part of its strategic planning process account for the effects of climate change in stress testing scenarios and systemic risk assessments revise expectations for credit portfolio concentrations based on climaterelated factors consider investments in climaterelated initiatives and lending to communities disproportionately impacted by the effects of climate change evaluate the impact of climate change on the banks borrowers and consider possible changes to underwriting criteria to account for climaterelated risks to mortgaged properties incorporate climaterelated financial risk into the banks internal reporting monitoring and escalation processes and prepare for the transition risks to the bank associated with the adjustment to a lowcarbon economy and related changes in laws regulations governmental policies technology and consumer behavior and expectations on october the financial stability oversight council published a report identifying climaterelated financial risk as an emerging threat to financial stability on december the occ issued proposed principles for climaterelated financial risk management for national banks with more than billion in total assets the occ has also indicated that all banks regardless of their size may have material exposures to climaterelated financial and other risks that require prudent management the federal banking agencies either independently or on an interagency basis are expected to adopt a more formal climate risk management framework for larger banking organizations in the coming months in addition states in which we conduct business have taken or are considering taking similar actions on climaterelated financial risks
