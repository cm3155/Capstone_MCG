update publicly any forwardlooking statements for any reason critical accounting estimates the accounting and reporting policies of bancshares are in accordance with gaap and are described in note a accounting policies and basis of presentation of the notes to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to exercise judgment in determining many of the estimates and assumptions utilized to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and expenses our financial position and results of operations could be materially affected by changes to these estimates and assumptions the following is a summary of the more critical areas where these critical assumptions and estimates could impact the financial condition results of operations and cash flows of bancshares allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan and lease losses alll represents the best estimate of inherent credit losses within the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date estimating credit losses requires judgment in determining the amount and timing of expected cash flows the value of the underlying collateral and loan specific attributes impacting the borrowers ability to repay contractual obligations other factors such as economic conditions historical loan losses migration of loans through delinquency stages and changes in the size composition and risks within the loan portfolio are also considered loan balances considered uncollectible are charged off against the alll if it is probable a borrower will be unable to pay all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement and a loss is probable a specific valuation allowance is determined recoveries of amounts previously chargedoff are generally credited to the alll purchased credit impaired pci loans are initially recorded at fair value and are generally pooled based upon common risk characteristics at each balance sheet date we evaluate whether the estimated cash flows have decreased and if so recognize an additional allowance subsequent improvements in expected cash flows results first in the recovery of any allowance established and then in the recognition of additional interest income over the remaining lives of the loans the alll for nonpurchased credit impaired nonpci loans is assessed at each balance sheet date and adjustments are recorded in provision for loan and lease losses general reserves for collective impairment are based on historical loss rates for each loan class by credit quality indicator and may be adjusted through a qualitative assessment to reflect current economic conditions and portfolio trends nonpci loans classified as impaired as of the balance sheet date are assessed for individual impairment based on the loans characteristics and either a specific valuation allowance is established or partial chargeoff is recorded management considers the established alll adequate to absorb incurred losses for loans and leases outstanding at december as of january bancshares adopted fasb asu financial instrumentscredit losses topic measurement of credit losses on financial instruments which changed the methodology accounting policies and inputs used in determining the allowance for credit losses see note a accounting policies and basis of presentation in the notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of our accounting policies for the alll and the implementation status of asu see note e allowance for loan and lease losses in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures financial measurements fair value is the price that could be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis examples of recurring uses of fair value include marketable equity securities investment securities available for sale and loans held for sale there were no liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at december we also measure certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis examples include impaired loans other real estate owned oreo goodwill and intangible assets assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date fair value is determined using different inputs and assumptions based upon the instrument being valued where observable market prices from transactions for identical assets or liabilities are not available we identify market prices for similar assets or liabilities if observable market prices are unavailable or impracticable to obtain for any such similar assets or liabilities we look to other modeling techniques which often incorporate unobservable inputs which are inherently subjective and require significant judgment fair value estimates requiring significant judgments are determined using various inputs developed by management with the appropriate skills understanding and knowledge of the underlying asset or liability to ensure the development of fair value estimates is reasonable typical pricing sources used in estimating fair values include but are not limited to active markets with high trading volume thirdparty pricing services external appraisals valuation models and commercial and residential evaluation reports in certain cases our assessments with respect to assumptions market participants would make may be inherently difficult to determine and the use of different assumptions could result in material changes to these fair value measurements see note p estimated fair values and note b business combinations in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures regarding fair value income taxes management estimates income tax expense using the asset and liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the amount of assets and liabilities reported in the consolidated financial statements and their respective tax bases in estimating the liabilities and corresponding expense related to income taxes management assesses the relative merits and risks of various tax positions considering statutory judicial and regulatory guidance because of the complexity of tax laws and regulations interpretation is difficult and subject to differing judgments accrued income taxes payable represents an estimate of the net amounts due to or from taxing jurisdictions based upon various estimates interpretations and judgments we evaluate our effective tax rate on a quarterly basis based upon the current estimate of net income the favorable impact of various credits statutory tax rates expected for the year and the amount of tax liability

compatible with bancshares objectives additionally purchases of equities and corporate bonds in other financial institutions have been made largely under a longterm earnings optimization strategy changes in the total balance of our investment securities portfolio result from trends in balance sheet funding and market performance generally when inflows arising from deposit and treasury services

nonperforming assets nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans and oreo resulting from both nonpci and pci loans nonpci loans are generally placed on nonaccrual when principal or interest becomes days past due or when it is probable that principal or interest is not fully collectible when nonpci loans are placed on nonaccrual all previously uncollected accrued interest is reversed from interest income and the ongoing accrual of interest is discontinued nonpci loans and leases are generally removed from nonaccrual status when they become current for a sustained period of time as to both principal and interest and there is no longer concern as to the collectability of principal and interest accretion of income for pci loans is discontinued when we are unable to estimate the amount or timing of cash flows pci loans may begin or resume accretion of income when information becomes available that allows us to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows oreo includes foreclosed property and branch facilities that we have closed but not sold net book values of oreo are reviewed at least annually to evaluate if writedowns are required the level of review is dependent on the value and type of the collateral with higher value and more complex properties receiving a more detailed review changes to the value of the assets between scheduled valuation dates are monitored through continued communication with brokers and monthly reviews by the asset manager assigned to each asset the asset manager uses the information gathered from brokers and other market sources to identify any significant changes in the market or the subject property as they occur valuations are then adjusted or new appraisals are ordered to ensure the reported values reflect the most current information since oreo is carried at the lower of cost or market value less estimated selling costs book value adjustments are only recorded when fair values have declined decisions regarding writedowns are based on factors that include appraisals previous offers received on the property market conditions and the number of days the property has been on the market table provides
