forecasting and modeling techniques used in estimating our allowance for credit losses key factors that have a significant impact on our allowance for credit losses include assumptions about employment levels home prices and the valuation of commercial properties automobiles and other collateral we have a governance framework intended to ensure that our estimate of the allowance for credit losses is appropriate our governance framework provides for oversight of methods models qualitative adjustments process controls and results at least quarterly representatives from the finance and risk management organizations review and assess our allowance methodologies key assumptions and the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses groups independent of our estimation functions participate in the review and validation process tasks performed by these groups include periodic review of the rationale for and quantification of inputs requiring judgment as well as adjustments to results we have a model policy established by an independent model risk office which governs the validation of models and related supporting documentation to ensure the appropriate use of models for estimating credit losses the model risk office validates all models and requires ongoing monitoring of their performance in addition to the allowance for credit losses on a quarterly basis we review and assess our estimate of expected losses related to unfunded lending commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable the factors impacting our assessment generally align with those considered in our evaluation of the allowance for credit losses for the commercial banking business changes to the reserve for losses on unfunded lending commitments are recorded through the provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of income and to other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets although we examine a variety of externally available data as well as our internal loan performance data to determine our allowance for credit losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments our estimation process is subject to risks and uncertainties including a reliance on historical loss and trend information that may not be representative of current conditions and indicative of future performance as well as economic forecasts that may not align with actual future economic conditions accordingly our actual credit loss experience may not be in line with our expectations we provide additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used in determining our allowance for credit losses for each of our loan portfolio segments in note 1summary of significant accounting policies we provide information on the components of our allowance disaggregated by impairment methodology and changes in our allowance in note 4allowance for credit losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments finance charge and fee reserves finance charges and fees on credit card loans are recorded in revenue when earned billed finance charges and fees on credit card loans are included in loans held for investment while unbilled finance charges and fees are included in interest receivable table start capital one financial corporation cof table end table of contents we continue to accrue finance charges and fees on credit card loans until the account is charged off we estimate the uncollectible portion of finance charges and fees in our finance charge and fee reserve billed finance charges and fees that are ultimately chargedoff as uncollectible are reflected as a reduction to revenue concurrent with our adoption of the cecl standard in the first quarter of we reclassified our finance charge and fee reserve of million to our allowance for credit losses with a corresponding increase to credit card loans held for investment we review and assess the appropriateness of our finance charge and fee reserve on a quarterly basis our methodology for estimating the uncollectible portion of finance charges and fees is consistent with the methodology we use to estimate the allowance for credit losses on the principal portion of our credit card loan receivables asset impairment in addition to our loan portfolio we review other assets for impairment on a regular basis in accordance with applicable accounting guidance this process requires significant management judgment and involves various estimates and assumptions goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date goodwill totaled billion as of both december and we did not recognize any goodwill impairment in and see note 6goodwill and intangible assets for additional information we perform our goodwill impairment test annually on october at a reporting unit level we are also required to test goodwill for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate it is morelikelythannot that an impairment may have occurred we have four reporting units credit card auto finance other consumer banking and commercial banking in the first quarter of we adopted accounting standards update asu no intangiblesgoodwill and other topic simplifying the test for goodwill impairment under the new guidance an impairment of a reporting units goodwill is determined based on the amount by which the reporting units carrying value exceeds its fair value limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit for the purpose of our goodwill impairment testing we calculate the carrying amount of a reporting unit using an allocated capital approach based on each reporting units specific regulatory capital requirements economic capital requirements and underlying risks the carrying amount for a reporting unit is the sum of its respective capital requirements goodwill and intangibles balances consolidated stockholders equity in excess of the sum of all reporting units capital requirements that is not identified for future capital needs such as dividends share buybacks or other strategic initiatives is allocated to the reporting units and the other category and assumed distributed to equity holders in future periods determining the fair value of a reporting unit is a subjective process that requires the use of estimates and the exercise of significant judgment we calculate the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow dcf calculation a form of the income approach this dcf calculation uses projected cash flows based on each reporting units internal forecast and the perpetuity growth method to calculate terminal values our dcf calculation requires management to make estimates about future loan deposit and revenue growth as well as credit losses and capital rates these cash flows and terminal values are then discounted using discount rates based on our external cost of capital with adjustments for the risk inherent in each reporting unit discount rates used for our reporting units ranged from to and we applied a terminal year longterm growth rate of to all reporting units the reasonableness of our dcf calculation is assessed by reference to a marketbased approach using comparable market multiples and recent market transactions where available the results of the annual impairment test for the reporting units indicated that the estimated fair values of the commercial banking credit card auto finance and other consumer banking reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts by between and assumptions used in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit are judgmental and inherently uncertain a change in the economic conditions of a reporting unit such as declines in business performance from industry or macroeconomic trends or from changes in our strategy adverse impacts to loan or deposit growth trends decreases in revenue increases in expenses increases in credit losses increases in capital requirements deterioration of market conditions declines in longterm growth expectations adverse impacts of regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated cost of capital including if these conditions are merely forecasted to occur in future periods could cause the estimated fair values of our reporting units to decline in the future and increase the risk of a goodwill impairment in a future period table start capital one financial corporation cof table end table of contents fair value fair value also referred to as an exit price is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date the fair value accounting guidance provides a threelevel fair value hierarchy for classifying financial instruments this hierarchy is based on the markets in which the assets or liabilities trade and whether the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are observable or unobservable the fair value measurement of a financial asset or liability is assigned a level based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below level valuation is based on quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level valuation is based on observable marketbased inputs other than level prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities level valuation is generated from techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market valuation techniques include pricing models discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques the degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted prices in active markets or observable market parameters when quoted prices and observable data in active markets are not fully available management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value changes in market conditions such as reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities may reduce the availability and reliability of quoted prices or observable data used to determine fair value we have developed policies and procedures to determine when markets for our financial assets and liabilities are inactive if the level and volume of activity has declined significantly relative to normal conditions if markets are determined to be inactive it may be appropriate to adjust price quotes received when significant adjustments are required to price quotes or inputs it may be appropriate to utilize an estimate based primarily on unobservable inputs significant judgment may be required to determine whether certain financial instruments measured at fair value are classified as level or level in making this determination we consider all available information that market participants use to measure the fair value of the financial instrument including observable market data indications of market liquidity and orderliness and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs used based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category judgments are made regarding the significance of the level inputs to the instruments fair value measurement in its entirety if level inputs are considered significant the instrument is classified as level the process for determining fair value using unobservable inputs is generally more subjective and involves a high degree of management judgment and assumptions we discuss changes in the valuation inputs and assumptions used in determining the fair value of our financial instruments including the extent to which we have relied on significant unobservable inputs to estimate fair value and our process for corroborating these inputs in note 16fair value measurement we have a governance framework and a number of key controls that are intended to ensure that our fair value measurements are appropriate and reliable our governance framework provides for independent oversight and segregation of duties our control processes include review and approval of new transaction types price verification and review of valuation judgments methods models process controls and results groups independent of our trading and investing functions participate in the review and validation process tasks performed by these groups include periodic verification of fair value measurements to determine if assigned fair values are reasonable including comparing prices from vendor pricing services to other available market information our fair value committee fvc which includes representation from business areas risk management and finance provides guidance and oversight to ensure an appropriate valuation control environment the fvc regularly reviews and approves our fair valuations to ensure that our valuation practices are consistent with industry standards and adhere to regulatory and accounting guidance we have a model policy established by an independent model risk office which governs the validation of models and related supporting documentation to ensure the appropriate use of models for pricing and fair value measurements the model risk office validates all models and requires ongoing monitoring of their performance table start capital one financial corporation cof table end table of contents the fair value governance process is set up in a manner that allows the chairperson of the fvc to escalate valuation disputes that cannot be resolved by the fvc to a more senior committee called the valuations advisory committee vac for resolution the vac is chaired by the chief financial officer and includes other members of senior management the vac convenes to review escalated valuation disputes there were no disputes for the years ended december and customer rewards reserve we offer products primarily credit cards which include programs that allow members to earn rewards based on account activity that can be redeemed for cash primarily in the form of statement credits gift cards travel or covering eligible charges the amount of rewards that a customer earns varies based on the terms and conditions of the rewards program and product the majority of our rewards do not expire and there is no limit on the amount of rewards an eligible card member can earn customer rewards costs which we generally record as an offset to interchange income are driven by various factors such as card member purchase volume the terms and conditions of the rewards program and rewards redemption cost we establish a customer rewards reserve that reflects managements judgment regarding rewards earned that are expected to be redeemed and the estimated redemption cost we use financial models to estimate ultimate redemption rates of rewards earned to date by current card members based on historical redemption trends current enrollee redemption behavior card product type year of program enrollment enrollment tenure and card spend levels our current assumption is that the vast majority of all rewards earned will eventually be redeemed we use the weightedaverage redemption cost during the previous twelve months adjusted as appropriate for recent changes in redemption costs including changes related to the mix of rewards redeemed to estimate future redemption costs we continually evaluate our reserve and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns changes to the terms and conditions of the rewards program and other factors we recognized customer rewards expense of billion in both and and billion in our customer rewards reserve which is included in other liabilities on our consolidated

leverage ratio of and a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of we are also subject to the capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer requirements as described below in july the federal banking agencies issued the capital simplification rule which finalized certain changes to the basel iii capital rules for institutions not subject to the basel iii advanced approaches these changes effective january generally raised the threshold above which a covered institution such as the company must deduct certain assets from its cet1 capital including certain deferred tax assets mortgage servicing assets and investments in unconsolidated financial institutions in october the federal banking agencies finalized the tailoring rules which amended the basel iii capital rules to provide for tailored application of certain capital requirements across different categories of banking institutions these categories are determined primarily by an institutions asset size with adjustments to a more stringent category possible if the institution exceeds certain riskbased thresholds as a bhc with total consolidated assets of at least billion that does not exceed any of the applicable riskbased thresholds we are a category iii institution under the tailoring rules therefore effective january we are no longer subject to the basel iii advanced approaches framework and certain associated capital requirements such as the requirement to include certain elements of aoci in our regulatory capital we remain subject to the countercyclical capital buffer requirement which is currently set at and supplementary leverage ratio requirement which were previously required only for basel iii advanced approaches institutions effective as of the first quarter of we excluded certain elements of aoci from our regulatory capital as permitted by the tailoring rules the tailoring rules and capital simplification rule have taken together decreased our capital requirements gsibs that are based in the us are subject to an additional cet1 capital requirement known as the gsib surcharge we are not a gsib based on the most recent available data and thus we are not subject to a gsib surcharge stress capital buffer rule the basel iii capital rules require banking institutions to maintain a capital conservation buffer composed of cet1 capital above the regulatory minimum ratios the capital conservation buffer for bhcs was previously fixed at in march the federal reserve issued a final rule to implement the stress capital buffer requirement the stress capital buffer requirement is institutionspecific and replaces the fixed capital conservation buffer for bhcs pursuant to the stress capital buffer rule the federal reserve will use the results of its supervisory stress test to determine the size of a bhcs stress capital buffer requirement in particular a bhcs stress capital buffer requirement will equal subject to a floor of the sum of i the difference between the bhcs starting cet1 capital ratio and its lowest projected cet1 capital ratio under the severely adverse scenario of the federal reserves supervisory stress test plus ii the ratio of the bhcs projected four quarters of common stock dividends for the fourth to seventh quarters of the planning horizon to the projected riskweighted assets for the quarter in which the bhcs projected cet1 capital ratio reaches its minimum under the supervisory stress test under the stress capital buffer rule framework the companys new standardized approach capital conservation buffer includes its stress capital buffer requirement which will be recalibrated every year based on the companys supervisory stress test results any gsib surcharge which is not applicable to us and the countercyclical capital buffer requirement which is currently set at any determination to increase the countercyclical capital buffer generally would be effective twelve months after the announcement of such an increase unless the federal banking agencies set an earlier effective date the companys stress capital buffer requirement is for the period from october through september at which point a revised stress capital buffer requirement will be applicable to the company based on the companys stress testing results therefore the companys minimum capital requirements plus the standardized approach capital conservation buffer for cet1 capital tier capital and total capital ratios under the stress capital buffer framework are and respectively for the period from october through september the stress capital buffer rule does not apply to the banks the capital conservation buffer for the banks continues to be fixed at accordingly each banks minimum capital requirements plus its capital

ratios to reflect the market risk in their trading portfolios as of december the company and cona are subject to the market risk rule see mdamarket risk profile below for additional information cecl transition rule as part of their response to the covid19 pandemic the federal banking agencies adopted the cecl transition rule which provides banking institutions an optional fiveyear transition period to phase in the impact of the cecl standard on their regulatory capital pursuant to the cecl transition rule a banking institution may elect to delay the estimated impact of adopting cecl on its regulatory capital through december and then phase in the estimated cumulative impact from january through december for the day ongoing impact of cecl during the initial two years the federal banking agencies use a uniform scaling factor of as an approximation of the increase in the allowance under the cecl standard compared to the prior incurred loss methodology accordingly from january through december electing banking institutions are permitted to add back to their regulatory capital an amount equal to the sum of the aftertax day cecl adoption impact and of the increase in the allowance since the adoption of the cecl standard beginning january through december the aftertax day cecl adoption impact and the cumulative day ongoing impact will be phased in to regulatory capital

adopted the cecl standard for accounting purposes as of january and made the cecl transition election for regulatory capital purposes in the first quarter of therefore the applicable amounts presented in this report reflect such election temporary exclusions for supplementary leverage ratio in addition in april as part of the response to the covid19 pandemic the federal reserve issued an interim final rule that temporarily excludes us treasury securities and deposits at federal reserve banks from the calculation of the supplementary leverage ratio for bhcs these exclusions became effective on april and will remain in effect through march subsequently in may the federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule that provides an option for depository institutions to make similar exclusions to the calculation of the supplementary leverage ratio if a depository institution elects to make such exclusions it must request prior approval from its primary federal banking regulator

reinforce those laws rules or regulations credit the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from an obligors failure to meet the terms of any contract with the company or otherwise perform as agreed liquidity the risk that the company will not be able to meet its future financial obligations as they come due or invest in future asset growth because of an inability to obtain funds at a reasonable price within a reasonable time market the risk that an institutions earnings or the economic value of equity could be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates or other market factors operational the risk of loss capital impairment adverse customer experience or reputational impact resulting from failure to comply with policies and procedures failed internal processes or systems or from external events reputation the risk to market value recruitment and retention of talented associates and maintenance of a loyal customer base due to the negative perceptions of our internal and external constituents regarding our business strategies and activities strategic the risk of a material impact on current or anticipated earnings capital franchise or enterprise value arising from the companys competitive and market position and evolving forces in the industry that can affect that position lack of responsiveness to these conditions strategic decisions to change the companys scale market position or operating model or failure to appropriately consider implementation risks inherent in the companys strategy table end we provide an overview of how we manage our seven major categories of risk below compliance risk management we recognize that compliance requirements for financial institutions are increasingly complex and that there are heightened expectations from our regulators and our customers in response we continuously evaluate the regulatory environment and proactively adjust our compliance program to fully address these expectations our compliance management program establishes expectations for determining compliance requirements assessing the risk of new product offerings creating appropriate controls and training to address requirements monitoring for control performance and independently testing for adherence to compliance requirements the program also establishes regular compliance reporting to senior business leaders the executive committee and the board of directors table start capital one financial corporation cof table end table of contents the chief compliance officer is responsible for establishing and overseeing our compliance management program business areas incorporate compliance requirements and controls into their business policies standards processes and procedures they regularly monitor and report on the efficacy of their compliance controls and our corporate compliance team periodically independently tests to validate the effectiveness of business controls credit risk management we recognize that we are exposed to cyclical changes in credit quality consequently we try to ensure our credit portfolio is resilient to economic downturns our most important tool in this endeavor is sound underwriting in unsecured consumer loan underwriting we generally assume that loans will be subject to an environment in which losses are higher than those prevailing at the time of underwriting in commercial underwriting we generally require strong cash flow collateral covenants structural enhancements or and guarantees in addition to sound underwriting we continually monitor our portfolio and take steps to collect or work out distressed loans the chief risk officer in conjunction with the consumer and commercial chief credit officers is responsible for establishing credit risk policies and procedures including underwriting and hold guidelines and credit approval authority and monitoring credit exposure and performance of our lending related transactions our consumer and commercial chief credit officers are responsible for evaluating the risk implications of credit strategy and the oversight of credit for both the existing portfolio and any new credit investments they also have formal approval authority for various types and levels of credit decisions including individual commercial loan transactions division presidents within each segment are responsible for managing the credit risk within their divisions and maintaining processes to control credit risk and comply with credit policies and guidelines in addition the chief risk officer establishes policies delegates approval authority and monitors performance for nonloan credit exposure entered into with financial counterparties or through the purchase of credit sensitive securities in our investment portfolio our credit policies establish standards in five areas customer selection underwriting monitoring remediation and portfolio management the standards in each area provide a framework comprising specific objectives and control processes these standards are supported by detailed policies and procedures for each component of the credit process starting with customer selection our goal is to generally provide credit on terms that generate above hurdle returns we use a number of quantitative and qualitative factors to manage credit risk including setting credit risk limits and guidelines for each of our lines of business we monitor performance relative to these guidelines and report results and any required mitigating actions to appropriate senior management committees and our board of directors liquidity risk management we manage liquidity risk by applying our liquidity framework the liquidity framework uses internal and regulatory stress testing and the evaluation of other balance sheet metrics to confirm that we maintain a fortified balance sheet that is resilient to uncertainties that may arise as a consequence of systemic idiosyncratic or combined liquidity events we continuously monitor market and economic conditions to evaluate emerging stress conditions and to develop appropriate action plans in accordance with our contingency funding plan and our recovery plan which include the companys policies procedures and action plans for managing liquidity stress events the liquidity framework enables us to manage our liquidity risk in accordance with regulatory requirements additionally the liquidity framework establishes governing principles that apply to the management of liquidity risk we use these principles to monitor measure and report liquidity risk to develop funding and investment strategies that enable us to maintain an adequate level of liquidity to support our businesses and satisfy regulatory requirements and to protect us from a broad range of liquidity events should they arise the chief risk officer in conjunction with the chief market and liquidity risk officer is responsible for the establishment of liquidity risk management policies and standards for governance and monitoring of liquidity risk at a corporate level we assess liquidity strength by evaluating several different balance sheet metrics under severe stress scenarios to ensure we can withstand significant funding degradation through idiosyncratic systemic and combined liquidity stress scenarios management reports liquidity metrics to appropriate senior management committees and our board of directors no less than quarterly we seek to mitigate liquidity risk strategically and tactically from a strategic perspective we have acquired and built deposit gathering businesses and actively monitor our funding concentration from a tactical perspective we have accumulated a sizable liquidity reserve comprised of cash and cash equivalents highquality unencumbered securities and committed table start capital one financial corporation cof table end table of contents collateralized credit lines we also continue to maintain access to secured and unsecured debt markets through regular issuance this combination of stable and diversified funding sources and our stockpile of liquidity reserves enable us to maintain confidence in our liquidity position market risk management the chief financial officer and the chief risk officer are responsible for the establishment of market risk management policies and standards for the governance and monitoring of market risk at a corporate level market risk is inherent from the financial instruments associated with our business operations and activities including loans deposits securities shortterm borrowings longterm debt and derivatives we manage market risk exposure which is principally driven by balance sheet interest rate risk centrally and establish quantitative risk limits to monitor and control our exposure we recognize that interest rate and foreign exchange risk is present in our business due to the nature of our assets and liabilities banks typically manage the tradeoff between nearterm earnings volatility and market value volatility by targeting moderate levels of each in addition to using industry accepted techniques to analyze and measure interest rate and foreign exchange risk we perform sensitivity analyses to identify our risk exposures under a broad range of scenarios investment securities and derivatives are the main levers for the management of interest rate risk in addition we also use derivatives to manage our foreign exchange risk the market risk positions for the company and each of the banks are calculated separately and in aggregate and analyzed against preestablished limits results are reported to the asset liability committee monthly and to the risk committee of the board of directors no less than quarterly management is authorized to utilize financial instruments as outlined in our policy to actively manage market risk exposure operational risk management we recognize the criticality of managing operational risk on both a strategic and daytoday basis and that there are heightened expectations from our regulators and our customers we have implemented appropriate operational risk management policies standards processes and controls to enable the delivery of high quality and consistent customer experiences and to achieve business objectives in a controlled manner the chief operational risk officer is responsible for establishing and overseeing our operational risk management program in accordance with basel iii requirements the program establishes practices for assessing the operational risk profile and executing key control processes for operational risks these risks include topics such as internal and external fraud cyber and technology risk data management model risk third party management and business continuity operational risk management enforces these practices and delivers reporting of operational risk results to senior business leaders the executive committee and the board of directors reputation risk management we recognize that reputation risk is of particular concern for financial institutions and increasingly technology companies in the current environment areas of concern have expanded to include company policies practices and values and with the growing use of social and digital platforms public corporations face a new level of scrutiny and channels for activism and advocacy the heightened expectations of internal and external stakeholders have made corporate culture values and conduct pressure points for individuals and advocates voicing concerns or seeking change we manage both strategic and tactical reputation issues and build our relationships with government officials media community and consumer advocates customers and other constituencies to help strengthen the reputations of both our company and industry our actions include implementing procustomer practices in our business and serving low to moderate income communities in our market area consistent with a quality bank and an innovative technology leader the executive vice president of external affairs is responsible for managing our overall reputation risk program daytoday activities are controlled by the frameworks set forth in our reputation risk management policy and other risk management policies strategic risk management we monitor external market and industry developments to identify potential areas of strategic opportunity or risk these items provide input for development of the companys strategy led by the chief

borrower credit scores as they provide insight into borrower risk profiles which give indications of potential future credit losses the key credit quality indicator for our commercial loan portfolios is our internal risk ratings as we generally classify loans that have been delinquent for an extended period of time and other loans with significant risk of loss as nonperforming in addition to these credit quality indicators we also manage and monitor other credit quality metrics such as level of nonperforming loans and net chargeoff rates we underwrite most consumer loans using proprietary

primary sources of market risk our market risk management strategies and the measures that we use to evaluate these exposures interest rate risk interest rate risk represents exposure to financial instruments whose values vary with the level or volatility of interest rates we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily from the differences in the timing between the maturities or repricing of assets and liabilities we manage our interest rate risk primarily by entering into interest rate swaps and other derivative instruments including caps floors options futures and forward contracts we

sensitivity measure estimates the impact on our projected 12month baseline interest ratesensitive revenue resulting from movements in interest rates interest ratesensitive revenue consists of net interest income and certain components of other noninterest income significantly impacted by movements in interest rates including changes in the fair value of freestanding interest rate derivatives in addition to our existing assets and liabilities we incorporate expected future business growth assumptions such as loan and deposit growth and pricing and plans for projected changes in our funding mix in our baseline forecast in measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our projected interest ratesensitive revenue we assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates detailed in table below at the current level of interest rates our interest rate sensitive revenue is expected to increase in higher rate scenarios and decrease modestly in lower rate scenarios our current sensitivity to upward shocks has increased as compared to december mainly due to the decline in interest rates and the growth in deposits and cash economic value of equity our economic value of equity sensitivity measure estimates the impact on the net present value of our assets and liabilities including derivative exposures resulting from movements in interest rates our economic value of equity sensitivity measure is calculated based on our existing assets and liabilities including derivatives and does not incorporate business growth assumptions or projected balance sheet changes key assumptions used in the calculation include projecting rate sensitive prepayments for mortgage securities loans and other assets term structure modeling of interest rates discount spreads and deposit volume and pricing assumptions in measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our economic value of equity we assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates detailed in table below our current economic value of equity sensitivity profile demonstrates that our economic value of equity increases in higher rate scenarios

addition to these industry standard measures we also consider the potential impact of alternative interest rate scenarios such as stressed rate shocks as well as steepening and flattening yield curve scenarios in our internal interest rate risk management decisions limitations of market risk measures the interest rate risk models that we use in deriving these measures incorporate contractual information internallydeveloped assumptions and proprietary modeling methodologies which project borrower and depositor behavior patterns in certain interest rate environments other market inputs such as interest rates market prices and interest rate volatility are also critical components of our interest rate risk measures we regularly evaluate update and enhance these assumptions models and analytical tools as we believe appropriate to reflect our best assessment of the market environment and the expected behavior patterns of our existing assets and liabilities there are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates the sensitivity analysis described above contemplates only certain movements in interest rates and is performed at a particular point in time based on the existing balance sheet and in some cases expected future business growth and funding mix assumptions the strategic actions that management may take to manage our balance sheet may differ significantly from our projections which could cause our actual earnings and economic value of equity sensitivities to differ substantially from the above
