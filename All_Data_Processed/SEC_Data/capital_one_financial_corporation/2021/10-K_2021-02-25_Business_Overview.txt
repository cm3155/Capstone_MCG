established by the federal reserve and the occ respectively the basel iii capital rules the basel iii capital rules implement certain capital and liquidity requirements published by the basel committee on banking supervision basel committee along with certain doddfrank act and other capital provisions under the basel iii capital rules we must maintain a minimum common equity tier cet1 capital ratio of a tier capital ratio of and a total capital ratio of in each case in relation to riskweighted assets in addition we must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of and a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of we are also subject to the capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer requirements as described below in july the federal banking agencies finalized certain changes to the basel iii capital rules for institutions not subject to the basel iii advanced approaches capital simplification rule these changes effective january generally raised the threshold above which a covered institution such as the company must deduct certain assets from its cet1 capital including certain deferred tax assets mortgage servicing assets and investments in unconsolidated financial institutions in october the federal banking agencies amended the basel iii capital rules to provide for tailored application of certain capital requirements across different categories of banking institutions tailoring rules these categories are determined primarily by an institutions asset size with adjustments to a more stringent category possible if the institution exceeds certain riskbased thresholds as a bhc with total consolidated assets of at least billion that does not exceed any table start capital one financial corporation cof table end of the applicable riskbased thresholds we are a category iii institution under the tailoring rules therefore effective january we were no longer subject to the basel iii advanced approaches framework and certain associated capital requirements such as the requirement to include certain elements of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci in our regulatory capital we remain subject to the countercyclical capital buffer requirement which is currently set at and supplementary leverage ratio requirement which were previously required only for basel iii advanced approaches institutions effective as of the first quarter of we excluded certain elements of aoci from our regulatory capital as permitted by the tailoring rules the tailoring rules and capital simplification rule have taken together decreased our capital requirements global systemically important banks gsibs that are based in the us are subject to an additional cet1 capital requirement gsib surcharge we are not a gsib based on the most recent available data and thus we are not subject to a gsib surcharge stress capital buffer rule the basel iii capital rules also require banking institutions to maintain a capital conservation buffer composed of cet1 capital above the regulatory minimum ratios the capital conservation buffer for bhcs was previously fixed at in march the federal reserve issued a final rule to implement the stress capital buffer requirement stress capital buffer rule the stress capital buffer requirement is institutionspecific and replaces the fixed capital conservation buffer for bhcs pursuant to the stress capital buffer rule the federal reserve will use the results of its supervisory stress test to determine the size of a bhcs stress capital buffer requirement in particular a bhcs stress capital buffer requirement will equal subject to a floor of the sum of i the difference between the bhcs starting cet1 capital ratio and its lowest projected cet1 capital ratio under the severely adverse scenario of the federal reserves supervisory stress test plus ii the ratio of the bhcs projected four quarters of common stock dividends for the fourth to seventh quarters of the planning horizon to the projected riskweighted assets for the quarter in which the bhcs projected cet1 capital ratio reaches its minimum under the supervisory stress test under the stress capital buffer rule framework the companys new standardized approach capital conservation buffer includes its stress capital buffer requirement which will be recalibrated every year based on the companys supervisory stress test results any gsib surcharge which is not applicable to us and the countercyclical capital buffer requirement which is currently set at any determination to increase the countercyclical capital buffer generally would be effective twelve months after the announcement of such an increase unless the federal banking agencies set an earlier effective date the stress capital buffer rule does not apply to the banks the capital conservation buffer for the banks continues to be fixed at if we fail to maintain our capital ratios above the minimum capital requirements plus the applicable buffer requirements we will face increasingly strict automatic limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to certain executive officers under the basel iii capital rules if a banking institutions capital ratios fall within its buffer requirements the maximum amount of capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments it can make is a function of its eligible retained income in march the federal banking agencies revised the definition of eligible retained income in their respective capital rules under the revised definition of eligible retained income any such automatic limitations on capital distributions would apply in a less severe and more gradual manner than would otherwise have occurred under the previous definition of that term this change was made in response to the covid19 pandemic to support banking organizations that choose to use their capital and liquidity buffers to lend and undertake other actions that support economic activity in a safe and sound manner cecl transition rule as part of the response to the covid19 pandemic the federal banking agencies adopted a final rule cecl transition rule that provides banking institutions an optional fiveyear transition period to phase in the impact of the cecl standard on their regulatory capital the cecl transition election pursuant to the cecl transition rule a banking institution may elect to delay the estimated impact of adopting cecl on its regulatory capital through december and then phase in the estimated cumulative impact from january through december for the day ongoing impact of cecl during the initial two years the federal banking agencies use a uniform scaling factor of as an approximation of the increase in the allowance under the cecl standard table start capital one financial corporation cof table end compared to the prior incurred loss methodology accordingly from january through december electing banking institutions are permitted to add back to their regulatory capital an amount equal to the sum of the aftertax day cecl adoption impact and of the increase in the allowance since the adoption of the cecl standard beginning january through december the aftertax day cecl adoption impact and the cumulative day ongoing impact will be phased in to regulatory capital at per year the following table summarizes the capital impact delay and phase in period on our regulatory capital from years to table start capital impact delayed phase in period day cecl adoption impact capital impact delayed to phased in phased in phased in fully phased in cumulative day ongoing impact scaling factor as an approximation of the increase in allowance under cecl table end we adopted the cecl standard for accounting purposes as of january and made the cecl transition election for regulatory capital purposes in the first quarter of temporary exclusions for supplementary leverage ratio in addition in april as part of the response to the covid19 pandemic the federal reserve issued an interim final rule that temporarily excludes us treasury securities and deposits at federal reserve banks from the calculation of the supplementary leverage ratio for bhcs these exclusions became effective on april and will remain in effect through march subsequently in may the federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule that provides an option for depository institutions to make similar exclusions to the calculation of the supplementary leverage ratio if a depository institution elects to make such exclusions it must request prior approval from its primary federal banking regulator before making capital distributions such as paying dividends to its parent company for as long as the exclusions are in effect neither cona nor cobna elected to make such exclusions market risk rule the market risk rule supplements the basel iii capital rules by requiring institutions subject to the market risk rule to adjust their riskbased capital ratios to reflect the market risk in their trading portfolios the market risk rule generally applies to institutions with aggregate trading assets and liabilities equal to the lesser of or more of total assets or billion or more the company and cona are subject to the market risk rule see mdamarket risk profile below for additional information fdicia and prompt corrective action the fdicia requires the federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action for banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements the fdicia establishes five capital ratio levels well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized the three undercapitalized categories are based upon the amount by which a bank falls below the ratios applicable to an adequately capitalized institution the capital categories relate to the fdicias prompt corrective action pca provisions and such capital categories may not constitute an accurate representation of the banks overall financial condition or prospects the basel iii capital rules updated the pca framework to reflect new higher regulatory capital minimums for an insured depository institution to be well capitalized it must maintain a total riskbased capital ratio of or more a tier capital ratio of or more a cet1 capital ratio of or more and a leverage ratio of or more an adequately capitalized depository institution must maintain a total riskbased capital ratio of or more a tier capital ratio of or more a cet1 capital ratio of or more a leverage ratio of or more and for category iii and certain other institutions under the tailoring rules a supplementary leverage ratio of or more the pca provisions also authorize the federal banking agencies to reclassify a banks capital category or take other action against banks that are determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or to have engaged in unsafe or unsound banking practices table start capital one financial corporation cof table end as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions the fdicia required the federal banking agencies to establish certain noncapital safety and soundness standards the standards adopted by the federal banking agencies relate generally to operations and management asset quality interest rate exposure and executive compensation the federal banking agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards basel iii and united states liquidity rules the basel committee has published a liquidity framework that includes two standards for liquidity risk supervision one standard the liquidity coverage ratio lcr seeks to promote shortterm resilience by requiring organizations to hold sufficient highquality liquid assets hqlas to survive a stress scenario lasting for days the other standard the net stable funding ratio nsfr seeks to promote longerterm resilience by requiring sufficient stable funding over a oneyear period based on the liquidity characteristics of the organizations assets and activities the company and the banks are subject to the lcr standard as implemented by the federal reserve and occ the lcr rule the lcr rule requires the company and each of the banks to hold an amount of eligible hqla that equals or exceeds of its respective projected adjusted net cash outflows over a 30day period each as calculated in accordance with the lcr rule the lcr rule requires us to calculate our lcr daily in addition the company is required to make quarterly public disclosures of its lcr and certain related quantitative liquidity metrics along with a qualitative discussion of its lcr under the tailoring rules as a category iii institution with less than billion in weighted average shortterm wholesale funding the companys and the banks total net cash outflows are multiplied by an outflow adjustment percentage of although the banks may hold more hqla than they need to meet their lcr requirements the lcr rule restricts the amount of such excess hqla held at the banks referred to as trapped liquidity that can be included in the companys hqla amount because we typically manage the banks lcrs to levels well above the amount of trapped liquidity will also increase as the banks total net cash outflows are reduced by the outflow adjustment percentage of in october the federal banking agencies finalized a rule to implement the nsfr in the united states the nsfr rule the nsfr rule requires the company and each of the banks to maintain an amount of available stable funding which is a weighted measure of a companys funding sources over a oneyear time horizon calculated by applying standardized weightings to equity and liabilities based on their expected stability that is no less than the amount of required stable funding which is calculated by applying standardized weightings to assets derivatives exposures and certain other items based on their liquidity characteristics as a category iii institution the company and the banks are subject to an nsfr requirement equal to of the full nsfr requirement the nsfr rule will become effective as of july and will apply to the company and each of the banks the nsfr rule includes a semiannual disclosure requirement with the first public disclosure required after june enhanced prudential standards and other related requirements we are subject to certain enhanced prudential standards under the doddfrank act as amended by the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act egrrcpa and implemented by various regulations issued by the federal banking agencies the financial stability oversight council fsoc may also issue recommendations to the federal reserve or other primary financial regulatory agencies to apply new or enhanced standards to certain financial activities or practices as part of the enhanced prudential standards the company is required to implement resolution planning for orderly resolution in the event it faces material financial distress or failure the fdic issued similar rules regarding resolution planning applicable to the banks in addition the occ has issued rules requiring banks with assets of billion or more to develop recovery plans detailing the actions they would take to remain a going concern when they experience considerable financial or operational stress but have not deteriorated to the point that resolution is imminent the enhanced prudential standards also include supervisory and companyrun stress testing requirements also known as the dfast stress testing requirements in particular the federal reserve is required to conduct annual stress tests on certain covered companies including us to ensure that the covered companies have sufficient capital to absorb losses and continue operations during adverse economic conditions under the stress capital buffer framework the result of our supervisory stress test will be used to determine our stress capital buffer requirement as a covered company that is a category iii institution under the tailoring rules we are also required to conduct our own stress tests and publish the results of such tests on our website or other public forum the company must disclose the results of its companyrun stress test on a biennial basis the table start capital one financial corporation cof table end occ has adopted a similar stress test rule requiring banks with at least billion in assets including cona to conduct their own companyrun stress tests under that occ rule cona must also disclose the results of its stress test on a biennial basis in addition the company is required to meet liquidity risk management standards conduct internal liquidity stress tests and maintain a 30day buffer of highly liquid assets in each case consistent with the requirements of the enhanced prudential standards these requirements are in addition to the lcr and nsfr rules discussed above in basel iii and united states liquidity rules the enhanced prudential standards also require that the company comply with and hold capital commensurate with the requirements of any regulations adopted by the federal reserve relating to capital planning and stress tests stress testing and capital planning regulations are discussed further below under dividends stock repurchases and transfers of funds finally the company is also required to establish and maintain an enterprisewide risk management framework that includes a risk committee and a chief risk officer although not a requirement of the doddfrank act the occ established regulatory guidelines heightened standards guidelines that apply heightened standards to the governance and risk management practices of large institutions subject to its supervision including the banks the heightened standards guidelines establish standards for the development and implementation by the banks of a risk governance framework dividends stock repurchases and transfers of funds under the federal reserves capital planning rules commonly referred to as comprehensive capital analysis and review or ccar requirements a covered bhc such as the company must submit a capital plan to the federal reserve on an annual basis that contains a description of all planned capital actions including dividends or stock repurchases over a ninequarter planning horizon beginning with the first quarter of the calendar year the capital plan is submitted ccar cycle the dfast stress testing requirements described above in enhanced prudential standards and other related requirements is a complementary exercise to ccar it is a forwardlooking exercise conducted by the federal reserve and each covered company to help assess whether a company has sufficient capital to absorb losses and continue operations during adverse economic conditions pursuant to the ccar requirements the company must file its capital plan and stress testing results with the federal reserve by april of each year unless the federal reserve designates a later date using data as of the end of the prior calendar year the federal reserve will conduct its supervisory stress test in the second quarter and determine the companys stress capital buffer by june of that year the company will have two business days from receipt of its stress capital buffer to make any necessary adjustments to its planned capital distributions the federal reserve will then finalize the stress capital buffer requirement for the company based on its adjusted planned capital distributions and confirm the companys planned capital distributions by august of that year the companys final stress capital buffer requirement will be effective from the fourth quarter of the year the capital plan is submitted through the third quarter of the following year the company may make the planned capital distributions confirmed by the federal reserve in addition under the stress capital buffer rule the company is no longer required to seek prior approval of the federal reserve to make capital distributions in excess of those included in its capital plan so long as the company is otherwise in compliance with the capital rules automatic limitations on capital distributions in december the federal reserve announced that it would maintain its prececl framework for calculating allowances on loans in the supervisory stress test for the and cycles until the impact of cecl is better known and understood the federal reserve stated further that although bhcs required to perform companyrun stress tests will be required to incorporate cecl into those stress tests starting in the cycle it will not issue supervisory findings on those bhcs allowance estimations in the ccar exercise through historically dividends from the companys direct and indirect subsidiaries have represented a major source of the funds we have used to pay dividends on our capital stock make payments on our corporate debt securities and meet our other obligations there are various federal law limitations on the extent to which the banks can finance or otherwise supply funds to the company through dividends and loans these limitations include minimum regulatory capital requirements federal banking law requirements concerning the payment of dividends out of net profits or surplus provisions of sections and of the federal reserve act and regulation w governing transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates as well as general federal regulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or unsound practices in general federal and applicable state banking laws prohibit insured depository institutions such as the banks from making dividend distributions without first table start capital one financial corporation cof table end obtaining regulatory approval if such distributions are not paid out of available earnings or would cause the institution to fail to meet applicable capital adequacy standards in june in light of the covid19 pandemic the federal reserve required all ccar participating bhcs including us to update and resubmit their capital plans in the fourth quarter of in addition the federal reserve required all participating bhcs including us to preserve capital by suspending share repurchases and capping common stock dividend payments for the third and fourth quarters of to the lower of i the amount paid in the second quarter of and ii an amount equal to the average net income earned across the four preceding calendar quarters scheduled payments on additional tier and tier capital instruments such as preferred stock and subordinated debt were not similarly restricted we conducted a second round of stress tests and submitted our updated capital plan to the federal reserve on november on december the federal reserve released the results of its second round of supervisory stress tests the federal reserve did not recalculate our stress capital buffer requirement at that time but reserved its ability to do so until march finally the federal reserve extended the capital distribution restrictions for all participating bhcs through at least the first quarter of with certain modifications in particular for the first quarter of participating bhcs may resume share repurchases but the
