economic conditions our reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions changes in the legal and regulatory environment and uncertainties in forecasting and modeling techniques used in estimating our allowance for credit losses key factors that have a significant impact on our allowance for credit losses include assumptions about employment levels home prices and the valuation of commercial properties automobiles and other collateral we have a governance framework intended to ensure that our estimate of the allowance for credit losses is appropriate our governance framework provides for oversight of methods models qualitative adjustments process controls and results at least quarterly representatives from the finance and risk management organizations review and assess our allowance methodologies key assumptions and the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses groups independent of our estimation functions participate in the review and validation process tasks performed by these groups include periodic review of the rationale for and quantification of inputs requiring judgment as well as adjustments to results we have a model policy established by an independent model risk office which governs the validation of models and related supporting documentation to ensure the appropriate use of models for estimating credit losses the model risk office validates all models and requires ongoing monitoring of their performance in addition to the allowance for credit losses on a quarterly basis we review and assess our estimate of expected losses related to unfunded lending commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable the factors impacting our assessment generally align with those considered in our evaluation of the allowance for credit losses for the commercial banking business changes to the reserve for losses on unfunded lending commitments are recorded through the provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of income and to other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets although we examine a variety of externally available data as well as our internal loan performance data to determine our allowance for credit losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments our estimation process is subject to risks and uncertainties including a reliance on historical loss and trend information that may not be representative of current conditions and indicative of future performance as well as economic forecasts that may not align with actual future economic conditions accordingly our actual credit loss experience may not be in line with our expectations we provide additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used in determining our allowance for credit losses for each of our loan portfolio segments in note 1summary of significant accounting policies and changes in our allowance in note 4allowance for credit losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments finance charge and fee reserve finance charges and fees on credit card loans are recorded in revenue when earned billed finance charges and fees on credit card loans are included in loans held for investment and unbilled finance charges and fees are included in interest receivable we continue to accrue finance charges and fees on credit card loans until the account is charged off billed finance charges and fees that are chargedoff are reflected as a reduction to revenue concurrent with our adoption of the cecl standard in the first quarter of we reclassified our finance charge and fee reserve of million to our allowance for credit losses with a corresponding increase to credit card loans held for investment we capital one financial corporation cof review and assess the appropriateness of our finance charge and fee reserve on a quarterly basis our methodology for estimating the uncollectible portion of finance charges and fees is consistent with the methodology we use to estimate the allowance for credit losses on the principal portion of our credit card loan receivables asset impairment in addition to our loan portfolio we review other assets for impairment on a regular basis in accordance with applicable accounting guidance this process requires significant management judgment and involves various estimates and assumptions goodwill we perform our goodwill impairment test annually on october at a reporting unit level as of our last annual test and as of march we had four reporting units which included credit card auto other consumer banking and commercial banking we are also required to test goodwill for impairment when a triggering event occurs that indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount as part of the annual goodwill impairment test we routinely assess our market capitalization based on the average market price of our stock relative to the aggregate fair value of our reporting units and determine whether any excess fair value of our reporting units is attributable to a reasonable control premium compared to historical control premiums or could be an indicator that the carrying value of our reporting units exceeds their fair value during the first quarter of our stock price along with the stock prices of others in the financial services industry declined significantly coinciding with the impact of the covid19 pandemic the significant decline in stock price resulted in a decline of our market capitalization and a significant increase in our indicated control premium compared to historic results in addition to the decline in stock price we also noted that the covid19 pandemic caused a disruption in the economy and there has been a sharp drop in interest rates after the federal reserve lowered its benchmark interest rate to near zero in march in light of these macroeconomic factors we considered whether the fair value of our reporting units may be below their carrying values and determined it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units remained substantially in excess of their carrying values as of march we will continue to monitor developments regarding the covid19 pandemic and measures implemented in response to the pandemic our market capitalization overall economic conditions and any other triggering events or circumstances that may indicate an impairment of goodwill in the future additionally in the first quarter of we adopted asu intangiblesgoodwill and other topic simplifying the test for goodwill impairment and updated our critical accounting policy for goodwill impairment historical guidance for goodwill impairment testing prescribed that the company must compare each reporting units carrying value to its fair value if the carrying value exceeds fair value an entity performs the second step which assigns the reporting units fair value to its assets and liabilities including unrecognized assets and liabilities in the same manner as required in purchase accounting to determine the impairment this asu eliminates the second step under the new guidance an impairment of a reporting units goodwill is determined based on the amount by which the reporting units carrying value exceeds its fair value limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit there have been no additional changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates described in our s unemployment credit bureau scores and general business trends management believes these factors are relevant in estimating expected credit losses and also considers an evaluation of overall portfolio credit quality based on indicators such as changes in our credit evaluation underwriting and collection management policies the effect of other external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements general economic conditions and business trends and uncertainties in forecasting and modeling techniques used in estimating our allowance the allowance related to commercial banking loans assessed on a pooled basis is based on our historical loss experience for loans with similar risk characteristics and consideration of the current credit quality of the portfolio which is supplemented by management judgment as described above these are adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of conditions likely to cause future losses which vary from historical levels we apply internal risk ratings to commercial banking loans which we use to assess credit quality and derive a total loss estimate based on an estimated probability of default default rate and loss given default loss severity management may also apply judgment to adjust the loss factors derived taking into consideration both quantitative and qualitative factors including general economic conditions industryspecific and geographic trends portfolio concentrations trends in internal credit quality indicators and current and past underwriting standards that have occurred but are not yet reflected in the historical data underlying our loss estimates the allowance related to smallerbalance homogeneous credit card and consumer banking loans whose terms have been modified in a tdr is calculated on a pool basis using historical loss experience adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of conditions likely to cause future losses which vary from historical levels for the respective class of assets the allowance related to consumer banking loans that are assessed at a loanlevel is determined based on key considerations that include the borrowers overall financial condition resources and payment history prospects for support from financially responsible guarantors and when applicable the estimated realizable value of any collateral the allowance related to commercial banking loans that are assessed at a loanlevel is generally determined in accordance with our policy for estimating expected credit losses for collateraldependent loans as described above offbalance sheet credit exposures in addition to the allowance we also measure expected credit losses related to unfunded lending commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable in our commercial banking business this reserve is measured using the same measurement objectives as the allowance for loans held for investment and is recorded within other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets these commitments are segregated by risk according to our internal risk rating scale which we use to assess credit quality and derive an expected credit loss estimate we assess these risk classifications taking into consideration both quantitative and qualitative factors including historical loss experience adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of conditions likely to cause future losses which vary from historical levels and utilization assumptions to estimate the reserve for unfunded lending commitments expected credit losses are not measured on unfunded lending commitments that are unconditionally cancellable including all of our unfunded credit card and consumer banking lending commitments and certain of our unfunded commercial banking lending commitments determining the appropriateness of the allowance and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio in light of the factors then prevailing may result in significant changes in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments in future periods see

investment securities include high quality debt instruments that are issued and guaranteed by the united states government and its agencies or are issued through certain governmentsponsored enterprises management performs periodic assessments to reevaluate this conclusion by considering any changes in historical losses current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts we evaluate impairment on a quarterly basis at the individual security level and determine whether any portion of the decline in fair value is due to a credit loss we make this determination through the use of quantitative and qualitative analyses our qualitative analysis includes factors such as the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost any changes in the securitys credit rating past defaults or delayed payments and adverse conditions impacting the security or issuer a credit loss exists to the extent that management does not expect to recover the amortized cost basis for investment securities which require further assessment we perform a quantitative analysis using a discounted cash flow methodology and compare the present value of expected future cash flows from the security available for sale to the securitys amortized cost basis projected future cash flows reflect managements best estimate and is based on our understanding of past events current conditions reasonable and supportable forecasts and are discounted by the securitys effective interest rate adjusted for expected prepayments the allowance for credit losses for investment securities reflects the difference by which the amortized cost basis exceeds the present value of future cash flows and is limited to the amount by which the securitys amortized cost exceeds its fair value see note

quality indicator for our commercial loan portfolios is our internal risk ratings we assign internal risk ratings to loans based on relevant information about the ability of the borrowers to repay their debt in determining the risk rating of a particular loan some of the factors considered are the borrowers current financial condition historical and projected future credit performance prospects for support from financially responsible guarantors the estimated realizable value of any collateral and current economic trends the scale based on our internal risk rating system is as follows noncriticized loans that have not been designated as criticized frequently referred to as pass loans criticized performing loans in which the financial condition of the obligor is stressed affecting earnings cash flows or collateral values the borrower currently has adequate capacity to meet nearterm obligations however the stress left unabated may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects at some future date criticized nonperforming loans that are not adequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or the collateral pledged if any loans classified as criticized nonperforming have a welldefined weakness or weaknesses which jeopardize the full repayment of the debt these loans are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain a credit loss if the deficiencies are not corrected and are generally placed on nonaccrual status we use our internal risk rating system for regulatory reporting determining the frequency of credit exposure reviews and evaluating and determining the allowance for credit losses for commercial loans generally loans that are designated as criticized performing and criticized nonperforming are reviewed quarterly by management to determine if they are appropriately classifiedrated and whether any impairment exists noncriticized loans are also generally reviewed at least annually to determine the appropriate risk rating in addition we evaluate the risk rating during the renewal process of any loan or if a loan becomes past due capital one financial corporation cof the following
