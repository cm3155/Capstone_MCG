implement the stress capital buffer requirement the stress capital buffer rule the stress capital buffer requirement is institutionspecific and replaces the fixed capital conservation buffer previously in place for bhcs pursuant to the stress capital buffer rule the federal reserve uses the results of its supervisory stress test to determine the size of a bhcs stress capital buffer requirement in particular a bhcs stress capital buffer requirement equals subject to a floor of the sum of i the difference between the bhcs starting cet1 capital ratio and its lowest projected cet1 capital ratio under the severely adverse scenario of the federal reserves supervisory stress test plus ii the ratio of the bhcs projected four quarters of common stock dividends for the fourth to

over a oneyear period based on the liquidity characteristics of the organizations assets and activities the company and the banks are subject to the lcr standard as implemented by the federal reserve and occ the lcr rule the lcr rule requires the company and each of the banks to hold an amount of eligible hqla that equals or exceeds of its respective projected adjusted net cash outflows over a 30day period each as calculated in accordance with the lcr rule the lcr rule requires us to calculate our lcr daily in addition the company is required to make quarterly public disclosures of its lcr and certain related quantitative liquidity metrics along with a qualitative discussion of its lcr under the tailoring rules as a category iii institution with less than billion in weighted average shortterm wholesale funding the companys and the banks total net cash outflows are multiplied by an outflow adjustment percentage of although the banks may hold more hqla than they need to meet their lcr requirements the lcr rule restricts the amount of such excess hqla held at the banks referred to as trapped liquidity that can be included in the companys hqla amount because we typically manage the banks lcrs to levels well above the result is additional trapped liquidity as the banks net cash outflows are reduced by the outflow adjustment percentage of in october the federal banking agencies finalized a rule to implement the nsfr in the united states the nsfr rule the nsfr rule requires the company and each of the banks to maintain an amount of available stable funding which is a weighted measure of a companys funding sources over a oneyear time horizon calculated by applying standardized weightings to equity and liabilities based on their expected stability that is no less than a specified percentage of its required stable funding which is calculated by applying standardized weightings to assets derivatives exposures and certain other items based on their liquidity characteristics as a category iii institution the company and the banks are each required to maintain available stable funding in an amount at least equal to of its required stable funding the nsfr

adverse economic conditions as well as to determine the companys stress capital buffer requirement as described above as a covered company that is a category iii institution under the tailoring rules we are also required to conduct our own stress tests and publish the results of such tests on our website or other public forum the company must disclose the results of its companyrun stress test on a biennial basis the occ has adopted a similar stress test rule requiring banks with at least billion in assets including cona to conduct their own companyrun stress tests under that occ rule cona must also disclose the results of its stress test on a biennial basis in addition the company is required to meet liquidity risk management standards conduct internal liquidity stress tests and maintain a 30day buffer of highly liquid assets in each case consistent with the requirements of the enhanced prudential standards these requirements are in addition to the lcr and nsfr rules discussed above in

capital plan with the federal reserve by april of each year unless the federal reserve designates a later date using data as of the end of the prior calendar year the federal reserve will release the results of the supervisory stress test and notify the company of its stress capital buffer requirement by june of that year the company will have two business days from receipt of its stress capital
