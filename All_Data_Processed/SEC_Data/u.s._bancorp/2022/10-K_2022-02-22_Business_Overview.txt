institutions in the state or any lesser or greater amount set by the state banks may merge across state lines to create interstate branches and are permitted to establish new branches in another state to the same extent as banks chartered by that state regulatory approval for acquisitions in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition federal bank regulators will consider a number of factors including the effect of the acquisition on competition financial condition and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels the competence experience and integrity of management and its record of compliance with laws and regulations the convenience and needs of the communities to be served including the acquiring institutions record of compliance under the cra the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities and the extent to which the transaction would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the united states banking or financial system in addition approval of interstate transactions requires that the acquiror satisfy regulatory standards for wellcapitalized and wellmanaged institutions in july the current united states presidential administration issued an executive order on competition which included provisions relating to bank mergers these provisions encourage the

legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries typically the majority of the companys operating funds are received in the form of dividends paid to the company by us bank national association federal law imposes limitations on the payment of dividends by national banks in general dividends payable by us bank national association and the companys trust bank subsidiaries as national banking associations are limited by rules that compare dividends to net income for periods defined by regulation the occ the federal reserve and the fdic also have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise including the company and us bank national association if in the banking regulators opinion payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization in addition the federal reserves final rule implementing the stress capital buffer scb provides that a bhc must receive prior approval for any dividend stock repurchase or other capital distribution other than a capital distribution on a newly issued capital instrument if the bhc is required to resubmit its capital plan the rule also provides that a bhc must resubmit its capital plan if among other things the bhc determines there has been or will be a material change in the bhcs risk profile financial condition or corporate structure since the bhc last submitted its capital plan capital requirements the company is subject to certain regulatory riskbased capital and leverage requirements under capital rules adopted by the federal reserve and us bank national association is subject to substantially similar rules adopted by the occ these rules implement the basel committees framework for strengthening the regulation supervision and risk management of banks basel iii as well as certain provisions of the doddfrank act these quantitative calculations are minimums and the federal reserve and occ may determine that a banking organization based on its size complexity or risk profile must maintain a higher level of capital in order to operate in a safe and sound manner under the tailoring rules the company and us bank national association are each subject to category iii standards and are standardized approach banking organizations that are subject to rules that provide for simplified capital requirements relating to the threshold deductions for mortgage servicing assets deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that a banking organization could not realize through net operating loss carry backs and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions as well as the inclusion of minority interests in regulatory capital substantial growth in total consolidated assets including assets obtained in acquisitions or crossjurisdictional activity as defined in the tailoring rules could affect the companys continued classification as a category iii institution which could result in more stringent capital liquidity and other regulatory requirements under the united states basel iiibased capital rules the company is subject to a minimum common equity tier cet1 capital ratio cet1 capital to riskweighted assets of percent a minimum tier capital ratio of percent and a minimum total capital ratio of percent the company is also subject to the scb which is based on the results of the federal reserves supervisory stress tests and the companys planned common stock dividends and if deployed by the federal reserve up to a percent common equity tier countercyclical capital buffer these additional requirements must be satisfied entirely with capital that qualifies as cet1 although the federal reserve has not to date raised the countercyclical capital buffer above zero percent the countercyclical capital buffer could change in the future the scb generally is assigned on an annual basis and becomes effective on october of each year subject to a percent floor and may vary over time as of december the scb applicable to the company is percent if the federal reserve were to raise the countercyclical capital buffer or if the scb applicable to the company were to exceed percent this would also change the effective minimum capital ratios to which the company is subject banking organizations that fail to meet the effective minimum ratios will be subject to constraints on capital distributions including dividends and share repurchases and certain discretionary executive compensation with the severity of the constraints depending on the extent of the shortfall and eligible retained income defined as the greater of i net income for the four preceding quarters net of distributions and associated tax effects not reflected in net income and ii the average of all net income over the preceding four quarters united states banking organizations are also subject to a minimum tier leverage ratio of percent as a category iii banking organization the company is also subject to a minimum supplementary leverage ratio slr of percent that takes into account both onbalance sheet and certain offbalance sheet exposures at december the company exceeded the applicable minimum tier leverage ratio and slr requirements in december the basel committee finalized a package of revisions to the basel iii framework the changes are meant to improve the calculation of riskweighted assets including by recalibrating risk weights and introducing new capital requirements for certain unconditionally cancellable commitments including unused lines of credit and improve the comparability of capital ratios by i enhancing the robustness and risk sensitivity of the standardized approaches for credit risk credit valuation adjustment cva risk and operational risk ii constraining the use of the internal model approaches by placing limits on certain inputs used to calculate capital requirements under the internal ratingsbased irb approach for credit risk and by removing the use of the internal model approaches for cva risk and for operational risk iii introducing a leverage ratio buffer to further limit the leverage of global systemically important banks gsibs and iv replacing the existing basel ii output floor with a more robust risksensitive floor based on the committees revised basel iii standardized approaches under the basel standards the implementation date for the revised standardized approach for credit risk and leverage ratios as well as the irb cva operational risk and market risk frameworks is january in addition in january the basel committee published a revised market risk framework that among other things revises the standardized approach for market risk the output floor will be subject to a transitional period beginning in january with full implementation by january the effects of these revisions on the company and us bank national association will depend on the manner in which they are implemented by the united states federal banking agencies at this time a united states based rule has not been released in the united states federal banking agencies adopted a rule that allowed banking organizations including the company and us bank national association to elect to delay temporarily the estimated effects of adopting the current expected credit loss accounting standard cecl on regulatory capital until january and subsequently to phase in the effects through january through the stress test cycle the federal reserve has not yet incorporated cecl into the calculation of the allowance for credit losses in supervisory stress tests for further discussion of cecl see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report the company and us bank national association elected to delay and subsequently phase in the regulatory capital impact of cecl in accordance with this rule for additional information regarding the companys regulatory capital see capital management in the annual report comprehensive capital analysis and review as required by the federal reserves ccar rules the company submits a capital plan to the federal reserve on an annual basis as part of the ccar process the federal reserve evaluates the companys plans to make capital distributions including by repurchasing stock or making dividend payments under a number of macroeconomic and companyspecific assumptions based on the companys and the federal reserves stress tests described under stress testing below these capital plans consist of a number of mandatory elements including an assessment of a companys sources and uses of capital over a ninequarter planning horizon assuming both expected and stressful conditions a detailed description of a companys process for assessing capital adequacy and a demonstration of a companys ability to maintain capital above each minimum regulatory capital ratio without taking the buffers into account under expected and stressful conditions stress testing the federal reserves ccar framework and the doddfrank act stress testing framework require bhcs subject to category iii standards such as the company to conduct an annual internal stress test in connection with its annual capital plan submission as well as biennial companyrun stress tests and subject such bank holding companies to annual supervisory stress tests conducted by the federal reserve among other things the companyrun stress tests employ stress scenarios developed by the company as well as stress scenarios provided by the federal reserve and incorporate the doddfrank act capital actions as opposed to the companys planned capital actions which are intended to normalize capital distributions across large united states bank holding companies the federal reserve conducts ccar and doddfrank act supervisory stress tests employing stress scenarios and internal supervisory models and incorporates the companys planned capital actions and the doddfrank act capital actions respectively into its stress tests the federal reserve and the company are currently required to publish the results of the annual supervisory and biennial companyrun stress tests respectively no later than june of each applicable year under the occs rules national banks with assets in excess of billion including us bank national association are required to submit companyrun stress test results to the occ concurrently with their parent bhcs ccar submission to the federal reserve the stress test is based on the occs stress scenarios which are typically the same as the federal reserves stress scenarios and capital actions that are appropriate for the economic conditions assumed in each scenario basel iii liquidity requirements as a category iii banking organization the company is subject to a minimum liquidity coverage ratio lcr the lcr is designed to ensure that bank holding companies have sufficient highquality liquid assets to survive a significant liquidity stress event lasting for calendar days in addition the company and us bank national association are subject to the net stable funding ratio nsfr rule which became effective in july and is designed to promote stable longerterm funding of assets and business activities over a oneyear time horizon under the tailoring rules and nsfr rule the company and us bank national association as category iii banking organizations with less than billion of weighted shortterm wholesale funding qualify for reduced lcr and nsfr requirements calibrated at percent of the full requirements prompt corrective action the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act fdicia provides a framework for regulation of depository institutions and their affiliates including parent holding companies by federal banking regulators as part of that framework the fdicia requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take prompt corrective action with respect to an fdicinsured depository institution such as us bank national association if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards supervisory actions by the appropriate federal banking regulator under the prompt corrective action rules generally depend upon an institutions classification within five capital categories an institution that fails to remain wellcapitalized becomes subject to a series of restrictions that increase in severity as its capital condition weakens such restrictions may include a prohibition on capital distributions restrictions on asset growth or restrictions on the ability to receive regulatory approval of applications the fdicia also provides for enhanced supervisory authority over undercapitalized institutions including authority for the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution the regulations apply only to banks and not to bhcs such as the company however the federal reserve is authorized to take appropriate action at the bhc level based on the undercapitalized status of the bhcs subsidiary banking institutions in certain instances relating to an undercapitalized bank the bhc would be required to guarantee the performance of the undercapitalized subsidiarys capital restoration plan and could be liable for civil money damages for failure to fulfill those guarantee commitments deposit insurance the dif provides insurance coverage for certain deposits up to a standard maximum deposit insurance amount of per depositor deposits at us national bank are insured up to the applicable limits the dif is funded through assessments on insured depository institutions including us bank national association based on the risk each institution poses to the dif the fdic may increase us bank national associations insurance premiums based on various factors including the fdics assessment of its risk profile in addition large insured depository institutions including us bank national association are subject to enhanced deposit account recordkeeping and related information technology system requirements meant to facilitate prompt payment of insured deposits if such an institution were to fail depositor preference under federal law in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution the claims of a receiver of the institution for administrative expense and the claims of holders of domestic deposit liabilities have priority over the claims of other unsecured creditors of the institution including holders of publicly issued senior or subordinated debt and depositors in nondomestic offices as a result those debtholders and depositors would be treated differently from and could receive if anything substantially less than the depositors in domestic offices of the depository institution orderly liquidation authority upon the insolvency of a bhc such as the company the fdic may be appointed as conservator or receiver of the bhc if the secretary of the treasury determines upon the written recommendation of the fdic and the federal reserve and after consultation with the president of the united states that certain conditions set forth in the doddfrank act regarding the potential impact on financial stability of a financial companys failure have been met fdic rules set forth a comprehensive method for the receivership of a covered financial company acting as a conservator or receiver the fdic would have broad powers to transfer any assets or liabilities of a bhc without the approval of its creditors
