fulltime equivalent basis as of december us bancorp employed people risk factors an investment in the company involves risk including the possibility that the value of the investment could fall substantially and that dividends or other distributions on the investment could be reduced or eliminated below are risk factors that could adversely affect the companys financial results and condition and the value of and return on an investment in the company economic and market conditions risk deterioration in business and economic conditions could adversely affect the companys lending business and the value of loans and debt securities it holds the companys business activities and earnings are affected by general business conditions in the united states and abroad including factors such as the level and volatility of shortterm and longterm interest rates inflation home prices unemployment and under employment levels bankruptcies household income consumer spending fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets liquidity of the global financial markets the availability and cost of capital and credit investor sentiment and confidence in the financial markets and the strength of the domestic and global economies in which the company operates changes in any of these conditions can adversely affect the companys consumer and commercial businesses and securities portfolios its level of chargeoffs and provision for credit losses its capital levels and liquidity and its results of operations given the high percentage of the companys assets represented directly or indirectly by loans and the importance of lending to its overall business weak economic conditions are likely to have a negative impact on the companys business and results of operations a deterioration in economic conditions could adversely impact new loan origination activity and existing loan utilization rates as well as delinquencies defaults and the ability of customers to meet obligations under the loans the value to the company of other assets such as investment securities most of which are debt securities or other financial instruments supported by loans similarly would be negatively impacted by widespread decreases in credit quality resulting from a weakening of the economy any deterioration in global economic conditions could damage the domestic economy or negatively impact the companys borrowers or other counterparties that have direct or indirect exposure to these regions such global disruptions can undermine investor confidence cause a contraction of available credit or create market volatility any of which could have significant adverse effects on the companys businesses results of operations financial condition and liquidity even if the companys direct exposure to the affected region is limited a withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union as well as other global political trends toward nationalism and isolationism could increase the probability of a deterioration in global economic conditions any further changes to economic policies could erode consumer confidence levels cause adverse changes in payment patterns lead to increases in delinquencies and default rates in certain industries or regions or have other negative market or customer impacts such developments could increase the companys loan chargeoffs and provision for credit losses any future economic deterioration that affects household or corporate incomes could also result in reduced demand for credit or feebased products and services changes in united states trade policies including the imposition of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs may adversely impact the companys business financial condition and results of operations there has been increased discussion and activity regarding potential and proposed changes to united states trade policies legislation treaties and tariffs including trade policies and tariffs affecting china the european union canada and mexico and retaliatory tariffs by such countries tariffs and retaliatory tariffs have been imposed and additional tariffs and retaliation tariffs have been proposed such tariffs retaliatory tariffs or other trade restrictions on products and materials that the companys customers import or export could cause the prices of its customers products to increase which could reduce demand for such products or reduce the companys customers margins and adversely impact their revenues financial results and ability to service debt this in turn could adversely affect the companys financial condition and results of operations in addition to the extent changes in the political environment have a negative impact on the company or on the markets in which it does business or otherwise result in sustained deterioration in economic conditions results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted in the future additionally if prices of consumer goods increase materially as a result of tariffs the ability of individual households to service debt may be negatively impacted in total these outcomes could adversely affect the companys financial condition and results of operations it remains unclear what the united states government or foreign governments will do with respect to tariffs already imposed additional tariffs that may be imposed or international trade agreements and policies and this uncertainty further complicates business planning for the companys customers in certain industries changes in interest rates could reduce the companys net interest income the companys earnings are dependent to a large degree on net interest income which is the difference between interest income from loans and investments and interest expense on deposits and borrowings net interest income is significantly affected by market rates of interest which in turn are affected by prevailing economic conditions by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and by the policies of various regulatory agencies like all financial institutions the companys financial position is affected by fluctuations in interest rates volatility in interest rates can also result in the flow of funds away from financial institutions into direct investments direct investments such as united states government and corporate securities and other investment vehicles including mutual funds generally pay higher rates of return than financial institutions because of the absence of federal insurance premiums and reserve requirements some foreign central banks have moved to a negative interest rate environment which has exerted downward pressure on the profitability of banks in those regions the companys financial condition could be damaged if this interest rate trend extends to the united states changes in or the discontinuance of the london interbank offered rate libor as an interest rate benchmark could adversely affect the companys business financial condition and results of operations in july the united kingdoms financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after it is likely that banks will cease submitting libor rates after and possibly sooner it is not possible to know whether libor will continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to libor or what the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives may have on the financial markets for liborlinked financial instruments in april the federal reserve bank of new york commenced publication of the secured overnight financing rate sofr which has been recommended as an alternative to united states dollar libor by the alternative reference rates committee a group of market and official sector participants however uncertainty remains as to the transition process and acceptance of sofr as the primary alternative to libor the market transition from libor to sofr or a different alternative reference rate is complex and could have a range of adverse impacts on the company in particular any such transition or reform could among other things i adversely impact the value of return on and trading for the companys financial assets or liabilities that are linked to libor including its securities loans and derivatives ii require renegotiations of outstanding financial assets and liabilities iii result in additional inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect of the companys preparation and readiness for the libor transition iv increase the risk of disputes or litigation andor increase expenses related to the transition including with respect to any actions resulting from the companys interpretation and execution of its roles and responsibilities in corporate trust transactions v adversely impact the companys reputation as it works with customers to transition loans and financial instruments from libor vi require successful system and analytics development and operationalization to transition the companys systems loan portfolio and risk management processes away from libor which will require the company to rely on the readiness of thirdparty vendors and vii cause significant disruption to financial markets that are relevant to the companys business segments in addition there can be no assurance that actions taken by the company and third parties to address these risks and otherwise prepare for the transition from libor to alternative interest rate benchmarks will be successful operations and business risk a breach in the security of the companys systems or the systems of certain third parties could disrupt the companys businesses result in the disclosure of confidential information damage its reputation and create significant financial and legal exposure the company experiences numerous attacks on its computer systems software networks and other technology assets daily and the number of attacks is increasing although the company devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade its systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of the companys computer systems software networks and other technology assets as well as its intellectual property and to protect the confidentiality integrity and availability of information belonging to the company and its customers the companys security measures may not be effective adversaries continue to develop more sophisticated cyber attacks that could impact the company many financial services institutions retailers and other companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information destroy data disable or degrade service or sabotage systems often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware cyber attacks and other means attacks on financial or other institutions important to the overall functioning of the financial system could also adversely affect directly or indirectly aspects of the companys businesses the increasing consolidation interdependence and complexity of financial entities and technology systems means that a technology failure cyber attack or other information or security breach that significantly degrades deletes or compromises the systems or data of one or more financial entities could have a material impact on counterparties or other market participants including the company this consolidation interconnectivity and complexity increases the risk of operational failure on both an entityspecific and an industrywide basis third parties that facilitate the companys business activities including exchanges clearinghouses payment and atm networks financial intermediaries or vendors that provide services or technology solutions for the companys operations could also be sources of operational and security risks to the company including with respect to breakdowns or failures of their systems misconduct by their employees or cyber attacks that could affect their ability to deliver a product or service to the company or result in lost or compromised information of the company or its customers the companys ability to implement backup systems or other safeguards with respect to thirdparty systems is limited furthermore an attack on or failure of a thirdparty system may not be revealed to the company in a timely manner which could compromise the companys ability to respond effectively some of these third parties may engage vendors of their own as they provide services or technology solutions for the companys operations which introduces the risk that these fourth parties could be the source of operational and security failures in addition during the past several years a number of retailers and hospitality companies have disclosed substantial cyber security breaches affecting debit and credit card accounts of their customers some of whom were the companys cardholders when that happens holders of company cards who have made purchases from the business whose systems were breached might experience fraud on their card accounts the company might suffer losses associated with reimbursing its customers for such fraudulent transactions on the customers card accounts as well as for other costs related to data security compromise events such as replacing cards associated with compromised card accounts these attacks involving company cards are likely to continue and could individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition or results of operations it is possible that the company may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types because the techniques used change frequently generally increase in sophistication often are not recognized until launched sometimes go undetected even when successful and originate from a wide variety of sources including organized crime hackers terrorists activists hostile foreign governments and other external parties those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees customers or other users of the companys systems to disclose sensitive information to gain access to the companys data or that of its customers or clients such as through phishing schemes other types of attacks may include computer viruses malicious or destructive code denialofservice attacks ransomware or ransom demands to not expose security vulnerabilities in the companys systems or the systems of third parties these risks may increase in the future as the company continues to increase its mobile and internetbased product offerings and expands its internal usage of webbased products and applications in addition the companys customers often use their own devices such as computers smart phones and tablet computers to make payments and manage their accounts the company has limited ability to assure the safety and security of its customers transactions with the company to the extent they are using their own devices which could be subject to similar threats in the event that the companys security systems are penetrated or circumvented or an authorized user intentionally or unintentionally removes loses or destroys operations data serious negative consequences for the company can follow including significant disruption of the companys operations misappropriation of confidential information of the company or that of its customers or damage to computers or systems of the company or those of its customers and counterparties these consequences could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws financial loss to the company or to its customers loss of confidence in the companys security measures customer dissatisfaction significant litigation exposure regulatory fines penalties or intervention reimbursement or other compensatory costs additional compliance costs and harm to the companys reputation all of which could adversely affect the company the company relies on its employees systems and third parties to conduct its business and certain failures by systems or misconduct by employees or third parties could adversely affect its operations the company operates in many different businesses in diverse markets and relies on the ability of its employees and systems to process a high number of transactions the companys business financial accounting data processing and other operating systems and facilities may stop operating properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are out of its control in addition to the risks posed by information security breaches as discussed above such systems could be compromised because of spikes in transaction volume electrical or telecommunications outages degradation or loss of internet or website availability natural disasters political or social unrest and terrorist acts the companys business operations may be adversely affected by significant disruption to the operating systems that support its businesses and customers if backup systems are used during outages they might not process data as quickly as do the primary systems resulting in the potential of some data not being backed up the company could also incur losses resulting from the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside of the company unauthorized access to its computer systems the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees errors relating to transaction processing and technology breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements and business continuation and disaster recovery this risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions fines or civil money penalties that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards adverse business decisions or their implementation and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity third parties provide key components of the companys business infrastructure such as internet connections network access and mutual fund distribution while the company has selected these third parties carefully it does not control their actions any problems caused by thirdparty service providers including as a result of not providing the company their services for any reason or performing their services poorly could adversely affect the companys ability to deliver products and services to the companys customers and otherwise to conduct its business replacing thirdparty service providers could also entail significant delay and expense in addition failure of third party service providers to handle current or higher volumes of use could adversely affect the companys ability to deliver products and services to clients and otherwise to conduct business technological or financial difficulties of a thirdparty service provider could adversely affect the companys businesses to the extent those difficulties result in the interruption or discontinuation of services provided by that party operational risks for large institutions such as the company have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies the use of internet services and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions the increased number and complexity of transactions being processed and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists activists and other external parties in the event of a breakdown in the internal control system improper operation of systems or improper employee or thirdparty actions the company could suffer financial loss face legal or regulatory action and suffer damage to its reputation the company could face significant legal and reputational harm if it fails to safeguard personal information the company is subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations both inside and outside of the united states governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals the protected individuals can include the companys customers its employees and the employees of the companys suppliers counterparties and other third parties ensuring that the companys collection use transfer and storage of personal information comply with applicable laws and regulations in relevant jurisdictions can increase operating costs impact the development of new products or services and reduce operational efficiency any mishandling or misuse of the personal information of customers employees or others by the company or a third party affiliated with the company could expose the company to litigation or regulatory fines penalties or other sanctions additional risks could arise if the company or third parties do not provide adequate disclosure or transparency to the companys customers about the personal information collected from them and its use any failure to receive document and honor the privacy preferences expressed by the companys customers any failure to protect personal information from unauthorized disclosure or any failure to maintain proper training on privacy practices for all employees or third parties who have access to personal data concerns regarding the effectiveness of the companys measures to safeguard personal information and abide by privacy preferences or even the perception that those measures are inadequate could cause the company to lose existing or potential customers and thereby reduce its revenues in addition any failure or perceived failure by the company to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices significant liabilities or regulatory fines penalties or other sanctions refer to supervision and regulation in the companys annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding data privacy laws and regulations any of these outcomes could damage the companys reputation and otherwise adversely affect its business services company with a high industry profile is inherently exposed to this risk the company could lose market share and experience increased costs if it does not effectively develop and implement new technology the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technologydriven products and services including innovative ways that customers can make payments or manage their accounts such as through the use of mobile payments digital wallets or digital currencies the companys continued success depends in part upon its ability to address customer needs by using technology to provide products and services that customers want to adopt and create additional efficiencies in the companys operations when launching a new product or service or introducing a new platform for the delivery of products and services the company might not identify or fully appreciate new operational risks arising from those innovations or might fail to implement adequate controls to mitigate those risks developing and deploying new technologydriven products and services can also involve costs that the company may not recover and divert resources away from other product development efforts the company may not be able to effectively develop and implement profitable new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could harm the companys competitive position and negatively affect its revenue and profit damage to the companys reputation could adversely impact its business and financial results reputation risk or the risk to the companys business earnings and capital from negative public opinion is inherent in the companys business negative public opinion about the financial services industry generally or the company specifically could adversely affect the companys ability to keep and attract customers investors and employees and could expose the company to litigation and regulatory action negative public opinion can result from the companys actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities including lending practices cybersecurity breaches failures to safeguard personal information discriminating or harassing behavior of employees toward other employees or customers mortgage servicing and foreclosure practices compensation practices sales practices environmental social and governance practices and disclosures regulatory compliance mergers and acquisitions and actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to that conduct in addition social and environmental activists are increasingly targeting financial services firms with public criticism for their relationships with clients engaged in industries they perceive to be harmful to communities or the environment such criticism directed at the company could generate dissatisfaction among its customers investors and employees although the company takes steps to minimize reputation risk in dealing with customers and other constituencies the company as a large diversified financial the companys business and financial performance could be adversely affected directly or indirectly by natural disasters climate change pandemics terrorist activities or international hostilities neither the occurrence nor the potential impact of natural disasters climate change pandemics terrorist activities or international hostilities can be predicted however these occurrences could impact the company directly for example by interrupting the companys systems which could prevent the company from obtaining deposits originating loans and processing and controlling its flow of business causing significant damage to the companys facilities or otherwise preventing the company from conducting business in the ordinary course or indirectly as a result of their impact on the companys borrowers depositors other customers vendors or other counterparties for example by damaging properties pledged as collateral for the companys loans or impairing the ability of certain borrowers to repay their loans the company could also suffer adverse consequences to the extent that natural disasters climate change pandemics terrorist activities or international hostilities affect the financial markets or the economy in general or in any particular region these types of impacts could lead for example to an increase in delinquencies bankruptcies or defaults that could result in the company experiencing higher levels of nonperforming assets net charge offs and provisions for credit losses the companys ability to mitigate the adverse consequences of these occurrences is in part dependent on the quality of the companys resiliency planning and the companys ability if any to anticipate the nature of any such event that occurs the adverse impact of natural disasters climate change pandemics terrorist activities or international hostilities also could be increased to the extent that there is a lack of preparedness on the part of national or regional emergency responders or on the part of other organizations and businesses that the company transacts with particularly those that it depends upon but has no control over additionally the force and frequency of natural disasters are increasing as the climate changes the companys framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to the company the companys risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss the company has established processes and procedures intended to identify measure monitor report and analyze the types of risk to which it is subject including liquidity risk credit risk market risk interest rate risk compliance risk strategic risk reputation risk and operational risk related to its employees systems and vendors among others however as with any risk management framework there are inherent limitations to the companys risk management strategies as there may exist or develop in the future risks that it has not appropriately anticipated or identified in addition the company relies on quantitative models to measure certain risks and to estimate certain financial values and these models could fail to predict future events or exposures accurately the company must also develop and maintain a culture of risk management among its employees as well as manage risks associated with third parties and could fail to do so effectively if the companys risk management framework proves ineffective the company could incur litigation and negative regulatory consequences and suffer unexpected losses that could affect its financial condition or results of operations regulatory and legal risk the company is subject to extensive and evolving government regulation and supervision which can increase the cost of doing business limit the companys ability to make investments and generate revenue and lead to costly enforcement actions banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds the federal deposit insurance fund and the united states financial system as a whole and not the companys debt holders or shareholders these regulations and the companys inability to act in certain instances without receiving prior regulatory approval affect the companys lending practices capital structure investment practices dividend policy ability to repurchase common stock and ability to pursue strategic acquisitions among other activities both the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which the company is subject have increased in response to the financial crisis of and as well as other factors such as technological and market changes regulatory enforcement and fines have also increased across the banking and financial services sector although the regulatory environment of the post financial crisis framework has been and is being rebalanced in some aspects the company expects that its business will remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision and that the level of scrutiny and the enforcement environment may fluctuate over time based on numerous factors including changes in the united states presidential administration or one or both houses of congress and public sentiment regarding financial institutions which can be influenced by scandals and other incidents that involve participants in the industry in addition although an overall reduction in the regulation of the financial services sector could result in some operational and cost benefits any new regulations or modifications to existing regulations and supervisory expectations have and may in the future necessitate changes to the companys existing regulatory compliance and risk management infrastructure and could result in increased competition changes to statutes regulations or regulatory policies or their interpretation or implementation andor regulatory practices requirements or expectations could affect the company in substantial and unpredictable ways for example the guidelines for heightened standards of the office of the comptroller of the currency and the enhanced prudential supervision rules of the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve have required and will continue to require significant oversight by the companys board of directors and focus by the companys management on governance and riskmanagement activities moreover general regulatory practices such as longer time frames to obtain regulatory approvals for acquisitions and other activities and the resultant impact on businesses the company may seek to acquire could affect the attractiveness of certain acquisitions or the introduction of new products or services or otherwise affect the companys ability to make acquisitions or introduce new products and services the financial services industry continues to face scrutiny from bank supervisors in the examination process and stringent enforcement of regulations on both the federal and state levels particularly with respect to mortgagerelated practices student lending practices sales practices and related incentive compensation programs and other consumer compliance matters as well as compliance with bank secrecy actanti money laundering bsaaml requirements and sanctions compliance requirements as administered by the office of foreign assets control this heightened regulatory scrutiny or the results of an investigation or examination may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions there is no assurance that those actions will not result in regulatory settlements or other enforcement actions against the company furthermore a single event involving a potential violation of law or regulation may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings either by multiple federal and state agencies and officials in the united states or in some instances regulators and other governmental officials in foreign jurisdictions federal law grants substantial enforcement powers to federal banking regulators and law enforcement agencies this enforcement authority includes among other things the ability to assess significant civil or criminal monetary penalties fines or restitution to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and institutionaffiliated parties these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices foreign supervisors also have increased regulatory scrutiny and enforcement in areas related to consumer compliance money laundering and information technology systems and controls among others any future enforcement action could have a material adverse impact on the company in general the amounts paid by financial institutions in settlement of proceedings or investigations and the severity of other terms of regulatory settlements are likely to remain elevated in the near term in some cases governmental authorities have required criminal pleas or other extraordinary terms including admissions of wrongdoing and the imposition of monitors as part of such settlements which could have significant consequences for a financial institution including loss of customers reputational harm restrictions on the ability to access the capital markets and the inability to operate certain businesses or offer certain products for a period of time noncompliance with sanctions laws andor aml laws or failure to maintain an adequate bsaaml compliance program can lead to significant monetary penalties and reputational damage in addition federal regulators evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering when determining whether to approve a proposed bank merger acquisition restructuring or other expansionary activity there have been a number of significant enforcement actions against banks broker dealers and nonbank financial institutions with respect to sanctions laws and bsaaml laws and some have resulted in substantial penalties including against the company and us bank national association in violations of laws and regulations or deemed deficiencies in risk management practices also may be incorporated into the companys confidential supervisory ratings a downgrade in these ratings or these or other regulatory actions and settlements could limit the companys ability to conduct expansionary activities for a period of time and require new or additional regulatory approvals before engaging in certain other business activities compliance with new regulations and supervisory initiatives have increased the companys costs over time and may continue to do so in addition regulatory changes may reduce the companys revenues limit the types of financial services and products it may offer alter the investments it makes affect the manner in which it operates its businesses increase its litigation and regulatory costs should it fail to appropriately comply with new or modified laws and regulatory requirements and increase the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products stringent requirements related to capital and liquidity have been adopted by united states banking regulators that may limit the companys ability to return earnings to shareholders or operate or invest in its business united states banking regulators have adopted stringent capital and liquidityrelated standards applicable to larger banking organizations including the company the rules require banks to hold more and higher quality capital as well as sufficient unencumbered liquid assets to meet certain stress scenarios defined by regulation in november the federal banking regulators adopted two final rules the tailoring rules that revised the criteria for determining the applicability of regulatory capital and liquidity requirements for large us banking organizations including the company and us bank national association and that tailored the application of the federal reserves enhanced prudential standards to large banking organizations although the tailoring rules and other recent changes to capital and liquidityrelated rules generally have simplified the regulatory framework applicable to the company future changes to the implementation of these rules including the common equity tier capital conservation buffer or additional capital and liquidityrelated rules could require the company to take further steps to increase its capital increase its investment security holdings divest assets or operations or otherwise change aspects of its capital andor liquidity measures including in ways that may be dilutive to shareholders or could limit the companys ability to pay common stock dividends repurchase its common stock invest in its businesses or provide loans to its customers refer to supervision and regulation in the companys annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding the companys capital and liquidity requirements additional requirements may be imposed in the future in december the basel committee finalized a package of revisions to the basel iii framework the changes are meant to improve the calculation of riskweighted assets and the comparability of capital ratios federal banking regulators are expected to undertake rulemakings in future years to implement these revisions in the united states in addition in april the federal reserve proposed stress capital buffer requirements that would replace the capital conservation buffer with a stress capital buffer and introduce a stress leverage buffer refer to supervision and regulation in the companys annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding the proposed stress buffer requirements the ultimate impact of revisions to the basel iiibased framework in the united states and the stress buffer requirements on the companys capital and liquidity will depend on the final rule makings and the implementation process thereafter the company is subject to significant financial and reputation risks from potential legal liability and governmental actions the company faces significant legal risks in its businesses and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and governmental proceedings against it and other financial institutions are substantial customers clients and other counterparties are making claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages while banking regulators and certain other governmental authorities have focused on enforcement as a participant in the financial services industry it is likely that the company will continue to experience a high level of litigation related to its businesses and operations in the future in addition governmental authorities have at times sought criminal penalties against companies in the financial services sector for violations and at times have required an admission of wrongdoing from financial institutions in connection with resolving such matters criminal convictions or admissions of wrongdoing in a settlement with the government can lead to greater exposure in civil litigation and reputational harm substantial legal liability or significant governmental action against the company could materially impact its financial condition and results of operations or cause significant reputational harm to the company which in turn could adversely impact its business prospects also the resolution of a litigation or regulatory matter could result in additional accruals or exceed established accruals for a particular period which could materially impact the companys results from operations for that period the company may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers as a result of breaches in contractual representations and warranties when the company sells mortgage loans that it has originated to various parties including gses it is required to make customary representations and warranties to the purchaser about the mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated the company may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or be subject to indemnification claims in the event of a breach of contractual representations or warranties that is not remedied within a certain period contracts for residential mortgage loan sales to the gses include various types of specific remedies and penalties that could be applied if the company does not adequately respond to repurchase requests if economic conditions and the housing market deteriorate or the gses increase their claims for breached representations and warranties the company could have increased repurchase obligations and increased losses on repurchases requiring material increases to its repurchase reserve credit and mortgage business risk heightened credit risk could require the company to increase its provision for credit losses which could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations and financial condition when the company lends money or commits to lend money it incurs credit risk or the risk of losses if its borrowers do not repay their loans as one of the largest lenders in the united states the credit performance of the companys loan portfolios significantly affects its financial results and condition if the current economic environment were to deteriorate the companys customers may have difficulty in repaying their loans or other obligations which could result in a higher level of credit losses and higher provisions for credit losses the company reserves for credit losses by establishing an allowance through a charge to earnings to provide for loan defaults and nonperformance the amount of the companys allowance for loan losses is based on its historical loss experience as well as an evaluation of the risks associated with its loan portfolio including the size and composition of the loan portfolio current economic conditions and geographic concentrations within the portfolio unexpected stress on the united states economy or the local economies in which the company does business may result in among other things unexpected deterioration in credit quality of the loan portfolio or in the value of collateral securing those loans in addition the process the company uses to estimate losses inherent in its credit exposure requires difficult subjective and complex judgments including forecasts of economic conditions and how these economic predictions might impair the ability of its borrowers to repay their loans these economic predictions and their impact may not be capable of accurate estimation which may in turn impact the reliability of the process as with any such assessments the company may fail to identify the proper factors or to accurately estimate the impacts of the factors that the company does identify the company also makes loans to borrowers where it does not have or service the loan with the first lien on the property securing its loan for loans in a junior lien position the company may not have access to information on the position or performance of the first lien when it is held and serviced by a third party which may adversely affect the accuracy of the loss estimates for loans of these types increases in the companys allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses and future provisions for loan losses could materially and adversely affect its financial results in addition the companys ability to assess the creditworthiness of its customers may be impaired if the models and approaches it uses to select manage and underwrite its customers become less predictive of future behaviors a concentration of credit and market risk in the companys loan portfolio could increase the potential for significant losses the company may have higher credit risk or experience higher credit losses to the extent its loans are concentrated by loan type industry segment borrower type or location of the borrower or collateral for example the companys credit risk and credit losses can increase if borrowers who engage in similar activities are uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or market conditions or by regulation such as regulation related to climate change deterioration in economic conditions or real estate values in states or regions where the company has relatively larger concentrations of residential or commercial real estate could result in higher credit costs in particular deterioration in real estate values and underlying economic conditions in california could result in significantly higher credit losses to the company changes in interest rates can impact the value of the companys mortgage servicing rights and mortgages held for sale and can make its mortgage banking revenue volatile from quarter to quarter which can reduce its earnings the company has a portfolio of msrs which is the right to service a mortgage loancollect principal interest and escrow amountsfor a fee the company initially carries its msrs using a fair value measurement of the present value of the estimated future net servicing income which includes assumptions about the likelihood of prepayment by borrowers changes in interest rates can affect prepayment assumptions and thus fair value when interest rates fall prepayments tend to increase as borrowers refinance and the fair value of msrs can decrease which in turn reduces the companys earnings further it is possible that because of economic conditions and or a weak or deteriorating housing market even when interest rates fall or remain low mortgage originations may fall or any increase in mortgage originations may not be enough to offset the decrease in the msrs value caused by the lower rates a decline in the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect the companys results of operations the companys ability to engage in routine funding or settlement transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other domestic or foreign financial institutions financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships the company has exposure to many different counterparties and the company routinely executes and settles transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients as a result defaults by or even rumors or questions about the soundness of one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally could lead to losses or defaults by the company or by other institutions and impact the companys predominately united statesbased businesses or the less significant merchant processing corporate trust and fund administration services businesses it operates in foreign countries many of these transactions expose the company to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client in addition the companys credit risk may be further increased when the collateral held by the company cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due the company there is no assurance that any such losses would not adversely affect the companys results of operations change in residual value of leased assets may have an adverse impact on the companys financial results the company engages in leasing activities and is subject to the risk that the residual value of the property under lease will be less than the companys recorded asset value adverse changes in the residual value of leased assets can have a negative impact on the companys financial results the risk of changes in the realized value of the leased assets compared to recorded residual values depends on many factors outside of the companys control including supply and demand for the assets condition of the assets at the end of the lease term and other economic factors liquidity risk if the company does not effectively manage its liquidity its business could suffer the companys liquidity is essential for the operation of its business market conditions unforeseen outflows of funds or other events could negatively affect the companys level or cost of funding affecting its ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner if the companys access to stable and lowcost sources of funding such as customer deposits is reduced the company might need to use alternative funding which could be more expensive or of limited availability any substantial unexpected or prolonged changes in the level or cost of liquidity could adversely affect the companys business loss of customer deposits could increase the companys funding costs the company relies on bank deposits to be a lowcost and stable source of funding the company competes with banks and other financial services companies for deposits including those that offer online channels if the companys competitors raise the interest rates they pay on deposits the companys funding costs may increase either because the company raises the interest rates it pays on deposits to avoid losing deposits to competitors or because the company loses deposits to competitors and must rely on more expensive sources of funding higher funding costs reduce the companys net interest margin and net interest income checking and savings account balances and other forms of customer deposits may decrease when customers perceive alternative investments such as the stock market as providing a better riskreturn tradeoff when customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments the company may lose a relatively lowcost source of funds increasing the companys funding costs and reducing the companys net interest income a downgrade in the companys credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity funding costs and access to capital markets the companys credit ratings are important to its liquidity a reduction in one or more of the companys credit ratings could adversely affect its liquidity increase its funding costs or limit its access to the capital markets further a downgrade could decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing or able contractually or otherwise to do business or lend to the company thereby adversely affecting the companys competitive position the companys credit ratings and credit rating agencies outlooks are subject to ongoing review by the rating agencies which consider a number of factors including the companys own financial strength performance prospects and operations as well as factors not within the control of the company including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally there can be no assurance that the company will maintain its current ratings and outlooks the company relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for its liquidity needs and the payment of those dividends is limited by laws and regulations the company is a separate and distinct legal entity from us bank national association and its nonbank subsidiaries the company receives a significant portion of its cash from dividends paid by its subsidiaries these dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on the companys stock and interest and principal on its debt various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that us bank national association and certain of its nonbank subsidiaries may pay to the company without regulatory approval also the companys right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiarys liquidation or reorganization is subject to prior claims of the subsidiarys creditors except to the extent that any of the companys claims as a creditor of that subsidiary may be recognized competitive and strategic risk the financial services industry is highly competitive and competitive pressures could intensify and adversely affect the companys financial results the company operates in a highly competitive industry that could become even more competitive as a result of legislative regulatory and technological changes as well as continued industry consolidation which may increase in connection with current economic and market conditions this consolidation may produce larger better capitalized and more geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wider array of financial products and services at more competitive prices the company competes with other commercial banks savings and loan associations mutual savings banks finance companies mortgage banking companies credit unions investment companies credit card companies and a variety of other financial services and advisory companies legislative or regulatory changes also could lead to increased competition in the financial services sector for example the economic growth act and the tailoring rules have reduced the regulatory burden of large bank holding companies including the company and some of its competitors and raised the asset thresholds at which more onerous requirements apply which could cause certain large bank holding companies with less than billion in total consolidated assets which were previously subject to more stringent enhanced prudential standards to become more competitive or to pursue expansion more aggressively in addition technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services such as loans and payment services that traditionally were banking products and made it possible for technology companies to compete with financial institutions in providing electronic internetbased and mobile phonebased financial solutions competition with nonbanks including technology companies to provide financial products and services is intensifying in particular the activity of financial technology companies fintechs has grown significantly over recent years and is expected to continue to grow fintechs have and may continue to offer bank or banklike products for example a number of fintechs have applied for bank or industrial loan charters in addition other fintechs have partnered with existing banks to allow them to offer deposit products to their customers many of these companies including the companys competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and some have lower cost structures in part due to lack of physical structures also the potential need to adapt to industry changes in information technology systems on which the company and financial services industry are highly dependent could present operational issues and require capital spending the companys ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including among others its ability to develop and execute strategic plans and initiatives developing maintaining and building longterm customer relationships based on quality service competitive prices high ethical standards and safe sound assets and industry and general economic trends a failure to compete effectively could contribute to downward price pressure on the companys products or services or a loss of market share the company may need to lower prices on existing products and services and develop and introduce new products and services to maintain market share the companys success depends in part on its ability to adapt its products and services to evolving industry standards there is increasing pressure to provide products and services at lower prices lower prices can reduce the companys net interest margin and revenues from its feebased products and services in addition the adoption of new technologies or further developments in current technologies require the company to make substantial expenditures to modify or adapt its existing products and services also these and other capital investments in the companys businesses may not produce expected growth in earnings anticipated at the time of the expenditure the company might not be successful in developing or introducing new products and services adapting to changing customer preferences and spending and saving habits achieving market acceptance of its products and services or sufficiently developing and maintaining loyal customer relationships the companys business could suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilled employees the companys success depends in large part on its ability to attract and retain key employees competition for the best people in most activities the company engages in can be intense the company may not be able to hire the best people or to keep them recent strong scrutiny of compensation practices has resulted in and may continue to result in additional regulation and legislation in this area as a result the company may not be able to retain key employees by providing adequate compensation in addition there is the potential for changes in immigration policies in multiple jurisdictions and the company could be adversely affected to the extent that immigration policies or work authorization programs were to unduly restrict or otherwise make it more difficult for qualified employees to work in or transfer among jurisdictions in which the company has operations or conducts its business there is no assurance that these developments will not cause increased turnover or impede the companys ability to retain and attract the highest caliber employees the company may not be able to complete future acquisitions and completed acquisitions may not produce revenue enhancements or cost savings at levels or within timeframes originally anticipated may result in unforeseen integration difficulties and may dilute existing shareholders interests the company regularly explores opportunities to acquire financial services businesses or assets and may also consider opportunities to acquire other banks or financial institutions the company cannot predict the number size or timing of acquisitions it might pursue the company must generally receive federal regulatory approval before it can acquire a bank or bank holding company the companys ability to pursue or complete an attractive acquisition could be negatively impacted by regulatory delay or other regulatory issues the company cannot be certain when or if or on what terms and conditions any required regulatory approvals will be granted for example the company may be required to sell branches as a condition to receiving regulatory approval for bank acquisitions if the company commits certain regulatory violations including those that result in a downgrade in certain of the companys bank regulatory ratings governmental authorities could as a consequence preclude it from pursuing future acquisitions for a period of time there can be no assurance that acquisitions the company completes will have the anticipated positive results including results related to expected revenue increases cost savings increases in geographic or product presence andor other projected benefits integration efforts could divert managements attention and resources which could adversely affect the companys operations or results the integration could result in higher than expected customer loss deposit attrition loss of key employees disruption of the companys businesses or the businesses of the acquired company or otherwise adversely affect the companys ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition also the negative effect of any divestitures required by regulatory authorities in acquisitions or business combinations may be greater than expected in addition future acquisitions may also expose the company to increased legal or regulatory risks finally future acquisitions could be material to the company and it may issue additional shares of stock to pay for those acquisitions which would dilute current shareholders ownership interests accounting and tax risk the companys reported financial results depend on managements selection of accounting methods and certain assumptions and estimates which if incorrect could cause unexpected losses in the future the companys accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how the company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations the companys management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so they comply with generally accepted accounting principles and reflect managements judgment regarding the most appropriate manner to report the companys financial condition and results of operations in some cases management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives any of which might be reasonable under the circumstances yet might result in the companys reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative certain accounting policies are critical to presenting the companys financial condition and results of operations they require management to make difficult subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates these critical accounting policies include the allowance for credit losses estimations of fair value the valuation of msrs and income taxes because of the uncertainty of estimates involved in these matters the company may be required to do one or more of the following significantly increase the allowance for credit losses andor sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the reserve provided recognize significant losses on the remeasurement of certain asset and liability balances or significantly increase its accrued taxes liability for more information refer to critical accounting policies in this annual report changes in accounting standards could materially impact the companys financial statements from time to time the financial accounting standards board and the united states securities and exchange commission change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the companys financial statements these changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how the company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations the company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively or apply an existing standard differently on a retroactive basis in each case potentially resulting in the company restating prior period financial statements as an example effective january the company adopted accounting guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board related to the impairment of financial instruments particularly the allowance for loan losses this guidance changes impairment recognition to a model that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses which is intended to result in more timely recognition of credit losses upon adoption the company increased its allowance for credit losses and reduced retained earnings by billion the companys investments in certain taxadvantaged projects may not generate returns as anticipated and may have an adverse impact on the companys financial results the company invests in certain taxadvantaged projects promoting affordable housing community development and renewable energy resources the companys investments in these projects are designed to generate a return primarily through the realization of federal and state income tax credits and other tax benefits over specified time periods the company is subject to the risk that previously recorded tax credits which remain subject to recapture by taxing authorities based on compliance features required to be met at the project level will fail to meet certain government compliance requirements and will not be able to be realized the possible inability to realize these tax credit and other tax benefits can have a negative impact on the companys financial results the risk of not being able to realize the tax credits and other tax benefits depends on many factors outside of the companys control including changes in the applicable tax code and the ability of the projects to be completed
