management section for discussion of liquidity management of the company corporate risk profile overview managing risks is an essential part of successfully operating a financial services company the companys board of directors has approved a risk management framework which establishes governance and risk management requirements for all risktaking activities this framework includes company and business line risk appetite statements which set boundaries for the types and amount of risk that may be undertaken in pursuing business objectives and initiatives the board of directors primarily through its risk management committee oversees performance relative to the risk management framework risk appetite statements and other policy requirements the executive risk committee erc which is chaired by the chief risk officer and includes the chief executive officer and other members of the executive management team oversees execution against the risk management framework and risk appetite statements the erc focuses on current and emerging risks including strategic and reputation risks by directing timely and comprehensive actions senior operating committees have also been established each responsible for overseeing a specified category of risk us bancorp the companys most prominent risk exposures are credit interest rate market liquidity operational compliance strategic and reputation leveraging the companys risk management framework the specific impacts of covid19 and related risks are identified for each of the most prominent exposures with respect to direct impacts from covid19 oversight and governance is managed through a centralized command center with frequent reporting to the managing committee and erc the board of directors also oversees the companys responsiveness to the covid19 pandemic credit risk is the risk of loss associated with a change in the credit profile or the failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its contractual obligations interest rate risk is the current or prospective risk to earnings and capital or market valuations arising from the impact of changes in interest rates market risk arises from fluctuations in interest rates foreign exchange rates and security prices that may result in changes in the values of financial instruments such as trading and availableforsale securities mortgage loans held for sale mlhfs msrs and derivatives that are accounted for on a fair value basis liquidity risk is the risk that financial condition or overall safety and soundness is adversely affected by the companys inability or perceived inability to meet its cash flow obligations in a timely and complete manner in either normal or stressed conditions operational risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems people including human errors or misconduct or adverse external events including the risk of loss resulting from breaches

competitiveness by affecting its ability to establish new relationships or services or continue serving existing relationships in addition to the risks identified above other risk factors exist that may impact the company refer to risk factors in the companys annual report on s as well as the potential impact on customers and the domestic economy resulting from the covid19 pandemic the risk management committee oversees the companys credit risk management process in addition credit quality ratings as defined by the company are an important part of the companys overall credit risk management and evaluation of its allowance for credit losses loans with a pass rating represent those loans not classified on the companys rating scale for problem credits as minimal credit risk has been identified loans with a special mention or classified rating including consumer lending and small business loans that are days or more past due and still accruing nonaccrual loans those loans considered troubled debt restructurings tdrs and loans in a junior lien position that are current but are behind a first lien position on nonaccrual encompass all loans held by the company that it considers to have a potential or welldefined weakness that may put full collection of contractual cash flows at risk the companys internal credit quality ratings for consumer loans are primarily based on delinquency and nonperforming status except for a limited population of larger loans within those portfolios that are individually evaluated for this limited population the determination of the internal credit quality rating may also consider collateral value and customer cash flows refer to note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the companys loan portfolios including internal credit quality ratings in addition refer to managements discussion and analysis credit risk management in the companys annual report on s and other macroeconomic factors customer payment history and credit scores and in some cases updated loantovalue ltv information reflecting current market conditions on real estatebased loans these and other risk characteristics including risk resulting from the covid19 pandemic are reflected in forecasts of delinquency levels bankruptcies and losses which are the primary factors in determining the allowance for credit losses for the consumer lending segment the company further disaggregates its loan portfolio segments into various classes based on their underlying risk characteristics the two classes within the commercial lending segment are commercial loans and commercial real estate loans the three classes within the consumer lending segment are residential mortgages credit card loans and other retail loans the companys consumer lending segment utilizes several distinct business processes and channels to originate consumer credit including traditional branch lending mobile and online banking indirect lending alliance partnerships correspondent banks and loan brokers each distinct underwriting and origination activity manages unique credit risk characteristics and prices its loan production commensurate with the differing risk profiles residential mortgage originations are generally limited to prime borrowers and are performed through the companys branches loan production offices mobile and online services and a wholesale network of originators the company may retain residential mortgage loans it originates on its balance sheet or sell the loans into the secondary market while retaining the servicing rights and customer relationships utilizing the secondary markets enables the company to effectively reduce its credit and other assetliability risks for residential mortgages that are retained in the companys portfolio and for home equity and second mortgages credit risk is also diversified by geography and managed by adherence to ltv and borrower credit criteria during the underwriting process the company estimates updated ltv information on its outstanding residential mortgages quarterly based on a method that combines automated valuation model updates and relevant home price indices ltv is the ratio of the loans outstanding principal balance to the current estimate of property value for home equity and second mortgages combined loantovalue cltv is the combination of the first mortgage original principal balance and the second lien outstanding principal balance relative to the current estimate of property value certain loans do not have an ltv or cltv primarily due to lack of availability of relevant automated valuation model andor home price indices values or lack of necessary valuation data on acquired loans the following tables provide

loans restructured loans in certain circumstances the company may modify the terms of a loan to maximize the collection of amounts due when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties or is expected to experience difficulties in the nearterm in most cases the modification is either a concessionary reduction in interest rate extension of the maturity date or reduction in the principal balance that would otherwise not be considered troubled debt restructurings concessionary modifications are classified as tdrs unless the modification results in only an insignificant delay in the payments to be received tdrs accrue interest if the borrower complies with the revised terms and conditions and has demonstrated repayment performance at a level commensurate with the modified terms over several payment cycles which is generally six months or greater at september performing tdrs were billion compared with billion at december the company continues to work with customers to modify loans for borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulties many of the companys tdrs are determined on a casebycase basis in connection with ongoing loan collection processes the modifications vary within each of the companys loan classes commercial lending segment tdrs generally include extensions of the maturity date and may be accompanied by an increase or decrease to the interest rate the company may also work with the borrower to make other changes to the loan to mitigate losses such as obtaining additional collateral andor guarantees to support the loan the company has also implemented certain residential mortgage loan restructuring programs that may result in tdrs the company modifies residential mortgage loans under federal housing administration united states department of veterans affairs and its own internal programs under these programs the company offers qualifying homeowners the opportunity to permanently modify their loan and achieve more affordable monthly payments by providing loan concessions these concessions may include adjustments to interest rates conversion of adjustable rates to fixed rates extensions of maturity dates or deferrals of payments capitalization of accrued interest andor outstanding advances or in limited situations partial forgiveness of loan principal in most instances participation in residential mortgage loan restructuring programs requires the customer to complete a shortterm trial period a permanent loan modification is contingent on the customer successfully completing the trial period arrangement and the loan documents are not modified until that time the company reports loans in a trial period arrangement as tdrs and continues to report them as tdrs after the trial period us bancorp credit card and other retail loan tdrs are generally part of distinct restructuring programs providing customers modification solutions over a specified time period generally up to months in accordance with regulatory guidance the company considers secured consumer loans that have had debt discharged through bankruptcy where the borrower has not reaffirmed the debt to be tdrs if the loan amount exceeds

borrowers experiencing temporary hardships shortterm consumer lending modification programs include payment reductions deferrals of up to three past due payments and the ability to return to current status if the borrower makes required payments the company may also make shortterm modifications to commercial lending loans with the most common modification being an extension of the maturity date

pay all contractual amounts owed covid19 payment relief the company has offered payment relief including forbearance payment deferrals and other customer accommodations to assist borrowers that have

third quarter and first nine months of was percent and percent respectively compared with percent and percent respectively for the same periods of the company expects net chargeoffs to return to more normalized levels over time as the beneficial impact of government stimulus during the pandemic dissipates analysis and determination of the allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses is established for current expected credit losses on the companys loan and lease portfolio including unfunded credit commitments the allowance considers expected losses for the remaining lives of the applicable assets inclusive of expected recoveries the allowance for credit losses is increased through provisions charged to earnings and reduced by net chargeoffs management evaluates the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses on a quarterly basis multiple economic scenarios are considered over a threeyear reasonable and supportable forecast period which includes increasing consideration of historical loss experience over years two and three these economic scenarios are constructed with interrelated projections of multiple economic variables and loss estimates are produced that consider the historical correlation of those economic variables with credit losses after the forecast period the company fully reverts to longterm historical loss experience adjusted for prepayments and characteristics of the current loan and lease portfolio to estimate losses over the remaining life of the portfolio the economic scenarios are updated at least quarterly and are designed to provide a range of reasonable estimates from better to worse than current expectations scenarios are weighted based on the companys expectation of economic conditions for the foreseeable future and reflect significant judgment and consideration of uncertainties that exist final loss estimates also consider factors affecting credit losses not reflected in the scenarios due to the unique aspects of current conditions and expectations these factors may include but are not limited to loan servicing practices regulatory guidance andor fiscal and monetary policy actions because business processes and credit risks associated with unfunded credit commitments are essentially the same as for loans the company utilizes similar processes to estimate its liability for unfunded credit commitments which is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet both the allowance for loan losses and the liability for unfunded credit commitments are included in the companys analysis of credit losses and reported reserve ratios the allowance recorded for credit losses utilizes forwardlooking expected loss models to consider a variety of factors affecting lifetime credit losses these factors include but are not limited to macroeconomic variables such as unemployment rates real estate prices gross domestic product levels and corporate bonds spreads as well as loan and borrower characteristics such as internal risk ratings on commercial loans and consumer credit scores delinquency status collateral us bancorp type and available valuation information consideration of endofterm losses on lease residuals and the remaining term of the loan adjusted for expected prepayments for each loan portfolio model estimates are adjusted as necessary to consider any relevant changes in portfolio composition lending policies underwriting standards risk management practices economic conditions or other factors that may affect the accuracy of the model expected credit loss estimates also include consideration of expected cash recoveries on loans previously chargedoff or expected recoveries on collateraldependent loans where recovery is expected through sale of the collateral where loans do not exhibit similar risk characteristics an individual analysis is performed to consider expected credit losses the allowance recorded for individually evaluated loans greater than million in the commercial lending segment is based on an analysis utilizing expected cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate the observable market price of the loan or the fair value of the collateral less selling costs for collateraldependent loans as appropriate for commercial tdrs individually evaluated for impairment attributes of the borrower are the primary factors in determining the allowance for credit losses however historical loss experience is also incorporated into the allowance methodology applied to this category of loans commercial lending segment tdr loans may be collectively evaluated for impairment where observed performance history including defaults is a primary driver of the loss allocation the allowance recorded for tdr loans in the consumer lending segment is determined on a homogenous pool basis utilizing expected cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate of the pool the expected cash flows on tdr loans consider subsequent payment defaults since modification the borrowers ability to pay under the restructured terms and the timing and amount of payments the allowance for collateraldependent loans in the consumer lending segment is determined based on the current fair value of the collateral less costs to sell when evaluating the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses for any loans and lines in a junior lien position the company considers the delinquency and modification status of the first lien at september the company serviced the first lien on percent of the home equity loans and lines in a junior lien position the company also considers the status of first lien mortgage accounts reported on customer credit bureau files when the first lien is not serviced by the company regardless of whether the company services the first lien an assessment is made of economic conditions problem loans recent loss experience and other factors in determining the allowance for credit losses based on the available information the company estimated million or percent of its total home equity portfolio at september represented nondelinquent junior liens where the first lien was delinquent or modified excluding loans in covidrelated forbearance programs the company considers historical loss experience on the loans and lines in a junior lien position to establish loss estimates for junior lien loans and lines the company services that are current but the first lien is delinquent or modified the historical longterm average loss experience related to junior liens has been relatively limited less than percent of the total portfolio annually and estimates are adjusted to consider current collateral support and portfolio risk characteristics these include updated credit scores and collateral estimates obtained on the companys home equity portfolio each quarter in its evaluation of the allowance for credit losses the company also considers the increased risk of loss associated with home equity lines that are contractually scheduled to convert from a revolving status to a fully amortizing payment beginning january when a loan portfolio is purchased the acquired loans are divided into those considered purchased with more than insignificant credit deterioration pcd and those not considered purchased with more than insignificant credit deterioration an allowance is established for each population and considers product mix risk characteristics of the portfolio bankruptcy experience delinquency status and refreshed ltv ratios when possible the allowance established for purchased loans not considered pcd is recognized through provision expense upon acquisition whereas the allowance established for loans considered pcd at acquisition is offset by an increase in the basis of the acquired loans any subsequent increases and decreases in the allowance related to purchased loans regardless of pcd status are recognized through provision expense with chargeoffs charged to the allowance the company did not have a material amount of pcd loans included in its loan portfolio at september the companys methodology for determining the appropriate allowance for credit losses also considers the imprecision inherent in the methodologies used and allocated to the various loan portfolios as a result amounts determined under the methodologies described above are adjusted by management to consider the potential impact of other qualitative factors not captured in quantitative model adjustments which include but are not limited to the following model imprecision us bancorp imprecision in economic scenario assumptions and emerging risks related to either changes in the economic environment that are affecting specific portfolios or changes in portfolio concentrations over time that may affect model performance the consideration of these items results in adjustments to allowance amounts included in the companys allowance for credit losses for each loan portfolio although the company determined the amount of each element of the allowance separately and considers this process to be an important credit management tool the entire allowance for credit losses is available for the entire loan portfolio the actual amount of losses can vary significantly from the estimated amounts at september the allowance for credit losses was billion percent of periodend loans compared with an allowance of billion percent of periodend loans at december the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was percent at september compared with percent at december the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to annualized loan net chargeoffs was percent at september compared with percent of full year net chargeoffs at december the decrease in the allowance for credit losses of billion percent at september compared with december reflected factors affecting economic conditions during the first nine months of including the enactment of additional benefits from government stimulus programs and broad vaccine availability in the united states that has reduced the risks associated with covid19 contributing to an economic recovery however economic uncertainty remains associated with rising inflationary concerns additional virus variants and lack of a clear path to government funding in addition to these factors expected loss estimates consider various factors including customer specific information impacting changes in risk ratings projected delinquencies and potential effects of diminishing liquidity without support of mortgage forbearance and direct federal stimulus currently consumer credit trends continue to perform better than expected while select commercial portfolios most impacted by covid19 continue to be monitored for structural shifts associated with the pandemic changes in economic conditions during the first nine months of included improvements in projected gross domestic product and unemployment levels for which reflected the additional government stimulus and availability of vaccines these factors are evaluated through a combination of quantitative calculations using economic scenarios and qualitative assessments that consider the high degree of uncertainty related to the unprecedented levels of both economic stress and the stimulus response the following table summarizes the baseline forecast for key economic variables the company used in its estimate of the allowance for credit losses at september and december

reflects quarterly average of forecasted reported united states unemployment rate b reflects cumulative change from december us bancorp baseline economic forecasts are used in combination with alternative scenarios and historical loss experience as is considered reasonable and supportable to inform the companys allowance for credit losses changes in the allowance for credit losses are based on a variety of factors including loan balance changes portfolio credit quality and mix changes and changes in general economic conditions and expectations including for unemployment and gross domestic product among other factors based on economic conditions at september it was difficult to estimate the length and severity of the longer term effects on certain industry sectors that may result from covid19 and the impact of other factors that may influence the level of eventual losses and corresponding requirements for the allowance for credit losses including the impact of inflationary pressures on certain lending sectors and diminishing liquidity after economic stimulus programs and accommodations delaying mortgage and rent payments end while reserves consider the uncertainty in these estimates the unpredictability of the covid19 pandemic could result in the recognition of credit losses in the companys loan portfolios and increases in the allowance for credit losses scenarios worse than the companys expected outcome at september include risks that government stimulus in response to the covid19 pandemic is less effective than expected or that a longer or more severe health crisis prolongs the downturn in economic activity potentially reducing the number of businesses that are ultimately able to resume operations after the crisis has passed other factors considered include concerns around inflationary pressures new virus variants sustainability of asset values and borrower liquidity along with the lack of a clear path to government funding the

and liability management purposes primarily in the following ways to convert fixedrate debt and availableforsale investment securities from fixedrate payments to floatingrate payments to convert floatingrate debt from floatingrate payments to fixedrate payments to mitigate changes in value of the companys unfunded mortgage loan commitments funded mlhfs and msrs to mitigate remeasurement volatility of foreign currency denominated balances and to mitigate the volatility of the companys net investment in foreign operations driven by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in addition the company enters into interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts to support the business requirements of its customers customerrelated positions the company minimizes the market and liquidity risks of customerrelated positions by either entering into similar offsetting positions with brokerdealers or on a portfolio basis by entering into other derivative or nonderivative financial instruments that partially or fully offset the exposure from these customerrelated positions the company may enter into derivative contracts that are either exchangetraded centrally cleared through clearinghouses or overthecounter the company does not utilize derivatives for speculative purposes the company does not designate all of the derivatives that it enters into for risk management purposes as accounting hedges because of the inefficiency of applying the accounting requirements and may instead elect fair value accounting for the related hedged items in particular the company enters into interest rate swaps swaptions forward commitments to buy tobeannounced securities tbas us treasury and eurodollar futures and options on us treasury futures to mitigate fluctuations in the value of its msrs but does not designate those derivatives as accounting hedges additionally the company uses forward commitments to sell tbas and other commitments to sell residential mortgage loans at specified prices to economically hedge the interest rate risk in its residential mortgage loan production activities at september the company had billion of forward commitments to sell hedging billion of mlhfs and billion of unfunded mortgage loan commitments the forward commitments to sell and the unfunded mortgage loan commitments on loans intended to be sold are considered derivatives under the accounting guidance related to accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities the company has elected the fair value option for the mlhfs derivatives are subject to credit risk associated with counterparties to the contracts credit risk associated with derivatives is measured by the company based on the probability of counterparty default including consideration of the covid19 pandemic the company manages the credit risk of its derivative positions by diversifying its positions among various counterparties by entering into master netting arrangements and where possible by requiring collateral arrangements the company may also transfer counterparty credit risk related to interest rate swaps to third parties through the use of risk

reviews the companys covered positions and establishes policies for market risk management including exposure limits for each portfolio the company uses a var approach to measure general market risk theoretically var represents the statistical risk of loss the company has to adverse market movements over a oneday time horizon the company uses the historical simulation method to calculate var for its covered positions measured at the ninetyninth percentile using a oneyear lookback period for distributions derived from past market data the market factors used in the calculations include those pertinent to market risks inherent in the underlying trading portfolios principally those that affect the companys corporate bond trading business foreign currency transaction business client derivatives business loan trading business and municipal securities business as well as those inherent in the companys foreign denominated balances and the derivatives used to mitigate the related measurement volatility on average the company expects the oneday var to be exceeded by actual losses two to three times per year related to these positions the company monitors the accuracy of internal var models and modeling processes by backtesting model performance regularly updating the historical data used by the var models and regular model validations to assess the accuracy of the models input processing and reporting components all models are required to be independently reviewed and approved prior to being placed in use if the company were to experience market losses in excess of the estimated var more often than expected the var models and associated assumptions would be analyzed and adjusted the average high low and periodend oneday var amounts for the companys covered positions were as follows nine months ended september  in millions average high low periodend the company did not experience any actual losses for its combined covered positions that exceeded var during the nine months ended september given the market volatility in the first quarter of resulting from effects of the covid19 pandemic the company experienced actual losses for its combined

that may not be captured by its var models including worst case historical market movement combinations that have not necessarily occurred on the same date us bancorp the company calculates stressed var using the same underlying methodology and model as var except that a historical continuous oneyear lookback period is utilized that reflects a period of significant financial stress appropriate to the companys covered positions the period selected by the company includes the significant market volatility of the last four months of the average high low and periodend oneday stressed var amounts for the companys covered positions were as follows nine months ended september  in millions average high low periodend valuations of positions in client derivatives and foreign currency activities are

evaluating the companys utilization of its capital held and the level of capital available to withstand unexpected negative market or economic conditions additionally presentation of these measures allows investors analysts and banking regulators to assess the companys capital position relative to other financial services companies these capital measures are not defined in generally accepted accounting principles gaap or are not currently effective or defined in banking regulations in addition certain of these measures differ from currently effective capital ratios defined by banking regulations principally in that the currently effective ratios which are subject to certain transitional provisions temporarily exclude the impact of the adoption of accounting guidance related to impairment of financial instruments based on the cecl methodology as a result these capital measures disclosed by the company may be considered nongaap financial measures management believes this information helps investors assess trends in the companys capital adequacy the company also discloses net interest income and related ratios and analysis on a taxableequivalent basis which may also be considered nongaap financial measures the company believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison of net interest income
