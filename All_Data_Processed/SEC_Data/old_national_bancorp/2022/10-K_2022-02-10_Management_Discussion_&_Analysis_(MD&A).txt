of total deposits at along with a loan to deposit ratio of and efficiency ratio of our net interest income increased slightly to million during compared to million in noninterest income decreased from million in to million in reflecting lower mortgage banking revenue and lower debt securities gains our noninterest expenses remain well controlled decreasing from million in to million in reflecting higher charges related to the onb way strategic initiative in and lower amortization of tax credit investments in the onb way charges totaled million in these decreases in noninterest expenses were partially offset by million of diligence and merger charges in associated with the anticipated first midwest merger on may old national entered into a definitive merger agreement with first midwest to combine in an allstock merger of equals transaction under the terms of the merger agreement which was unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies first midwest stockholders will receive  of old national common stock for each share of first midwest common stock they own following completion of the transaction former first midwest stockholders are expected to collectively represent approximately of the combined company the new organization will operate under the old national bancorp and old national bank names with headquarters and the main office located in evansville indiana and commercial and consumer banking operations headquartered in chicago illinois during the third quarter of we received approval of the merger from the occ and the shareholders of old national and first midwest on january the occ granted us an extension of days to april for consummating the bank merger on january we received federal reserve approval for the merger with all necessary regulatory approvals received the merger is expected to occur after the close of business and after the end of regular trading hours on the nasdaq stock market on february subject to customary closing conditions pandemic update as previously disclosed the covid19 pandemic has created economic and financial disruptions that have adversely affected our operations during and our historically careful underwriting practices diverse and granular portfolios and midwestbased footprint has helped minimize any adverse impact to old national in addition the combination of the vaccine rollout government stimulus payments and reduced spending during the pandemic are likely contributing factors mitigating the impact of the pandemic on the companys business financial condition results of operations and its clients as of december however there are continuing concerns that indicate a slower return to prepandemic routines examples of these concerns relate to increases in new covid19 cases hospitalizations and deaths leading to additional government imposed restrictions refusals to receive the vaccine along with new strain concerns supply chain issues remaining unresolved longer than anticipated unemployment increases while consumer confidence and spending falls and rising geopolitical tensions given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances surrounding the pandemic it is difficult to predict the future adverse financial impact to old national business outlook we saw a strong start to a strengthening economic recovery in which was damaged midyear by the delta covid19 variant and again late in by the omicron variant the moodys us macroeconomic outlook predicts the pandemic to slowly recede with each future wave of the virus expected to be less disruptive than the preceding wave as state and local governments and businesses skillfully mitigate the impact of the virus the conference board forecasted that gdp growth will approximate in the fourth quarter of vs growth in the third quarter of which is a downgrade from earlier fourth quarter of gdp growth forecasts due to the rapid spread of the omicron variant in december the previous conference board forecasts had assumed that a new variant would dampen economic growth in the united states but not until the first quarter of since then the omicron variant has spread more rapidly than anticipated and is yielding record high new infections yet appears to be less severe since hospitalizations and mortality rates have not spiked to the same degree as the initial covid19 virus however the conference board notes that mass infections are impacting labor supply as workers recover from illness or postpone reentering the workforce this supplyside disruption could result in additional shortages and has resulted in an increase in the inflation forecast for early as expected in middecember the federal reserve indicated that it will conclude its largescale asset purchase program as soon as march and that three basis point rate hikes would follow in additional omicroninduced inflationary pressures could result in even more aggressive tightening which is a downside risk to the conference boards forecast this forecast includes spending associated with the bipartisan infrastructure package approved in however it does not incorporate the proposed build back better social and climate package the annual growth is currently estimated to be for the year and the conference board forecasts that the us economy will grow by an estimated in and an estimated in if omicron and other future variants evolve to be less severe it could help the us economy return to normal prepandemic levels while we are cautiously optimistic about from a us economic standpoint risks related to supply chain disruption slowing job growth significant and persistent tightening in financial market conditions inflation and geopolitical tensions could halt this recovery our strategy evolution continues into a commerciallyoriented regional bank that consistently delivers top quartile performance this is accomplished by continuing to focus on the fundamentals of basic banking which are loan growth noninterest income growth prudent capital deployment and expense management execution of these fundamentals will help us deliver meaningful positive operating leverage organic loan growth continues to be our priority as we enter into our commercial loan production and pipeline are at record high levels yet we continue to adhere to our disciplined underwriting process we believe our approach to downgrading troubled credits early and a patient approach to resolving issues results in better outcomes for our clients and ultimately lower costs for old national bank despite the lingering challenges due to the pandemic in overall credit quality remains healthy old national has not experienced any specific sector credit related weaknesses yet we remain watchful for any credits that deserve extra attention as we slowly return to a prepandemic economic environment as we look ahead to and our anticipated partnership with first midwest we are positioned to close the merger after the close of business and after the end of regular trading hours on the nasdaq stock market on february we have established the organizational structure and leadership positions for all client segments and support areas and have communicated those decisions throughout the organization further we also agreed upon our core processing system and supporting applications finally we are initiating our

section for reconciliations to gaap financial measures comparison of fiscal years and net interest income net interest income is the most significant component of our earnings comprising of revenues net interest income and net interest margin are influenced by many factors primarily the volume and mix of earning assets funding sources and interest rate fluctuations other factors include the level of accretion income on purchased loans prepayment risk on mortgage and investmentrelated assets and the composition and maturity of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities the path of the economy continues to depend on the course of covid19 progress on vaccinations and an easing of supply constraints are expected to support continued gains on economic activity risks to the economic outlook remain including from new variants of the virus interest rates remained at near historic lows during after declining dramatically in the first half of due to the covid19 pandemic the federal reserves federal funds range is currently in a target range of to with the effective fed funds rate in the to range if interest rates decline further our interest rate spread could decline which may result in a decrease in our net interest income however management has taken balance sheet restructuring derivative and deposit pricing actions to help mitigate this risk loans typically generate more interest income than investment securities with similar maturities funding from client deposits generally costs less than wholesale funding sources factors such as general economic activity federal reserve monetary policy and price volatility of competing alternative investments can also exert significant influence on our ability to optimize our mix of assets and funding net interest income and net interest margin net interest income is the excess of interest received from interestearning assets over interest paid on interestbearing liabilities for analytical purposes net interest income is presented in the table that follows adjusted to a taxable equivalent basis to reflect what our taxexempt assets would need to yield in order to achieve the same aftertax yield as a taxable asset we used the federal statutory tax rate in effect of for all periods this analysis portrays the income tax benefits related to taxexempt assets and helps to facilitate a comparison between taxable and taxexempt assets management believes that it is a standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest margin and net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis therefore

commercial clients to finance capital purchases ranging from computer equipment to transportation equipment the credit decisions for these transactions are based upon an assessment of the overall financial capacity of the applicant a determination is made as to the applicants ability to repay in accordance with the proposed terms as well as an overall assessment of the risks involved in addition to an evaluation of the applicants financial condition a determination is made of the probable adequacy of the primary and secondary sources of repayment such as additional collateral or personal guarantees to be relied upon in the transaction credit agency reports of the applicants credit history supplement the analysis of the applicants creditworthiness commercial mortgages and construction loans are offered to real estate investors developers and builders primarily domiciled in the geographic market areas we serve indiana kentucky michigan minnesota and wisconsin these loans are secured by first mortgages on real estate at ltv margins deemed appropriate for the property type quality location and sponsorship generally these ltv ratios do not exceed the commercial properties are predominantly nonresidential properties such as retail centers industrial properties and to a lesser extent more specialized properties substantially all of our commercial real estate loans are secured by properties located in our primary market area in the underwriting of our commercial real estate loans we obtain appraisals for the underlying properties decisions to lend are based on the economic viability of the property and the creditworthiness of the borrower in evaluating a proposed commercial real estate loan we primarily emphasize the ratio of the propertys projected net cash flows to the loans debt service requirement the debt service coverage ratio normally is not less than and it is computed after deduction for a vacancy factor and property expenses as appropriate in addition a personal guarantee of the loan or a portion thereof is often required from the principals of the borrower in most cases we require title insurance insuring the priority of our lien fire and extended coverage casualty insurance and flood insurance if appropriate in order to protect our security interest in the underlying property in addition business interruption insurance or other insurance may be required construction loans are underwritten against projected cash flows derived from rental income business income from an owneroccupant or the sale of the property to an enduser we may mitigate the risks associated with these types of loans by requiring fixedprice construction contracts performance and payment bonding controlled disbursements and presale contracts or prelease agreements consumer we offer a variety of first mortgage and junior lien loans to consumers within our markets with residential home mortgages comprising our largest consumer loan category these loans are secured by a primary residence and are underwritten using traditional underwriting systems to assess the credit risks of the consumer decisions are primarily based on ltv ratios dti ratios liquidity and credit scores a maximum ltv ratio of is generally required although higher levels are permitted with mortgage insurance or other mitigating factors we offer fixed rate mortgages and variable rate mortgages with interest rates that are subject to change every year after the first third fifth or seventh year depending on the product and are based on indexed rates such as prime we do not offer paymentoption facilities subprime loans or any product with negative amortization home equity loans are secured primarily by second mortgages on residential property of the borrower the underwriting terms for the home equity product generally permit borrowing availability in the aggregate up to of the appraised value of the collateral property at the time of origination we offer fixed and variable rate home equity loans with variable rate loans underwritten at fullyindexed rates decisions are primarily based on ltv ratios dti ratios and credit scores we do not offer home equity loan products with reduced documentation automobile loans include loans and leases secured by new or used automobiles we originate automobile loans and leases primarily on an indirect basis through selected dealerships we require borrowers to maintain collision insurance on automobiles securing consumer loans with us listed as loss payee our procedures for underwriting automobile loans include an assessment of an applicants overall financial capacity including credit history and the ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan although an applicants creditworthiness is the primary consideration the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral security to the proposed loan amount asset quality communitybased lending personnel along with regionbased independent underwriting and analytic support staff extend credit under guidelines established and administered by our enterprise risk committee this committee which meets quarterly is made up of independent outside directors the committee monitors credit quality through its review of information such as delinquencies credit exposures peer comparisons problem loans and chargeoffs in addition the committee reviews and approves recommended loan policy changes to assure our policy remains appropriate for the current lending environment we lend to commercial and commercial real estate clients in many diverse industries including manufacturing agribusiness transportation mining wholesaling and retailing old national manages

improvement from at december nonaccrual loans decreased million from december to december primarily due to lower commercial real estate and commercial nonaccrual loans as a percentage of nonaccrual loans the allowance for credit losses was at december compared to at december if nonaccrual and renegotiated loans outstanding at december and respectively had been accruing interest throughout the year in accordance with their original terms interest income of approximately million in and million in would have been recorded on these loans the amount of interest income actually recorded on nonaccrual and renegotiated loans was million in and million in total criticized and classified assets were million at december a decrease of million from december other classified assets include investment securities that fell below investment grade rating totaling million at december compared to million at december old national may choose to restructure the contractual terms of certain loans the decision to restructure a loan versus aggressively enforcing the collection of the loan may benefit old national by increasing the ultimate probability of collection any loans that are modified are reviewed by old national to identify if a tdr has occurred which is when for economic or legal reasons related to a borrowers financial difficulties old national bank grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider terms may be modified to fit the ability of the borrower to repay in line with its current financial status the modification of the terms of such loans includes one or a combination of the following a reduction of the stated interest rate of the loan an extension of the maturity date at a stated rate of interest lower than the current market rate of new debt with similar risk or a permanent reduction of the recorded investment of the loan loans modified in a tdr are typically placed on nonaccrual status until we determine that the future collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured which generally requires that the borrower demonstrate a period of performance according to the restructured terms for six months if we are unable to resolve a nonperforming loan issue the credit will be charged off when it is apparent there will be a loss for large commercial type loans each relationship is individually analyzed for evidence of apparent loss based on quantitative benchmarks or subjectively based upon certain events or particular circumstances for residential and consumer loans a charge off is recorded at the time foreclosure is initiated or when the loan becomes to days past due whichever is earlier for commercial tdrs an allocated reserve is established within the allowance for credit losses for the difference between the carrying value of the loan and its computed value to determine the computed value of the loan one of the following methods is selected the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loans original effective interest rate the loans observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent the allocated reserve is established as the difference between the carrying value of the loan and the collectable value if there are significant changes in the amount or timing of the loans expected future cash flows impairment is recalculated and the valuation allowance is adjusted accordingly when a residential or consumer loan is identified as a tdr the loan is typically written down to its collateral value less selling

had not committed to lend any additional funds to clients with outstanding loans that are classified as tdrs at december or december the terms of certain other loans were modified during and that did not meet the definition of a tdr it is our process to review all classified and criticized loans that during the period have been renewed have entered into a forbearance agreement have gone from principal and interest to interest only or have extended the maturity date in order to determine whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty an evaluation is performed of the probability that the borrower will be in payment default on its debt in the foreseeable future without the modification the evaluation is performed under our internal underwriting policy we also evaluate whether a concession has been granted or if we were adequately compensated through a market interest rate additional collateral or a bona fide guarantee we also consider whether the modification was insignificant relative to the other terms of the agreement or the delay in a payment in general once a modified loan is considered a tdr the loan will always be considered a tdr until it is paid in full otherwise settled sold or charged off however guidance also permits for loans to be removed from tdr status when subsequently restructured under these circumstances at the time of the subsequent restructuring the borrower is not experiencing financial difficulties and this is documented by a current credit evaluation at the time of the restructuring under the terms of the subsequent restructuring agreement the institution has granted no concession to the borrower and the subsequent restructuring agreement includes market terms that are no less favorable than those that would be offered for a comparable new loan for loans subsequently restructured that have cumulative principal forgiveness the loan should continue to be measured in accordance with asc receivables overall however consistent with asc troubled debt restructurings by creditors creditor disclosure of troubled debt restructurings the loan would not be required to be reported in the years following the restructuring if the subsequent restructuring meets both of these criteria has an interest rate at the time of the subsequent restructuring that is not less than a market interest rate and is performing in compliance with its modified terms after the subsequent restructuring we have developed relief programs to assist borrowers in financial need due to the effects of the covid19 pandemic the interagency statement issued by our banking regulators encourages financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers who are or may be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations due to the effects of covid19 additionally section of the cares act further provides that a qualified loan modification is exempt by law from classification as a tdr as defined by gaap from the period beginning march until the earlier of december or the date that is days after the date on which the national emergency concerning the covid19 outbreak declared by the president of the united states under the national emergencies act terminates the interagency statement was subsequently revised in april to clarify the interaction of the original guidance with section of the cares act as well as setting forth the banking regulators views on consumer protection considerations additionally section of the caa extends the relief provided by the cares act for financial institutions to suspend the gaap accounting treatment for troubled debt restructuring to january after this date we will follow the gaap accounting treatment to determine if new modifications meet the definition of a tdr in accordance with such guidance during and throughout we offered shortterm modifications in response to covid19 to borrowers who were current and otherwise not past due these included shortterm days or less modifications in the form of payment deferrals fee waivers extensions of repayment terms or other delays in payment that were insignificant these loan deferrals totaled million at december us

credit losses on loans and unfunded commitments beginning january with the adoption of cecl we calculated allowance for credit losses using current expected credit losses methodology as of january old national increased the allowance for credit losses for loans by million and increased the allowance for credit losses for unfunded loan commitments by million since the asu covers credit losses over the expected life of a loan as well as considering future changes in macroeconomic conditions the increase related to the acquired loan portfolio totaled million credit quality within the loans held for investment portfolio is continuously monitored by management and is reflected within the allowance for credit losses for loans the allowance for credit losses is an estimate of expected losses inherent within the companys loans held for investment portfolio credit quality is assessed and monitored by evaluating various attributes and the results of those evaluations are utilized in underwriting new loans and in our process for estimating expected credit losses expected credit loss inherent in noncancelable offbalancesheet credit exposures is accounted for as a separate liability included in other liabilities on the balance sheet the allowance for credit losses for loans held for investment is adjusted by a credit loss expense which is reported in earnings and reduced by the chargeoff of loan amounts net of recoveries accrued interest receivable is excluded from the estimate of credit losses the allowance for credit loss estimation process involves procedures to appropriately consider the unique characteristics of our loan portfolio segments these segments are further disaggregated into loan classes based on the level at which credit risk of the loan is monitored when computing the level of expected credit losses credit loss assumptions are estimated using a model that categorizes loan pools based on loss history delinquency status and other credit trends and risk characteristics including current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain in future periods evaluations of the overall loan portfolio in light of the factors and forecasts then prevailing may result in significant changes in the allowance and credit loss expense in those future periods the allowance level is influenced by loan volumes loan aqr migration or delinquency status changes in historical loss experience and other conditions influencing loss expectations such as reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions the methodology for estimating the amount of expected credit losses reported in the allowance for credit losses has two basic components first an assetspecific component involving individual loans that do not share risk characteristics with other loans and the measurement of expected credit losses for such individual loans and second a pooled component for estimated expected credit losses for pools of loans that share similar risk characteristics the loan categories used to monitor and analyze interest income and yields are different than the portfolio segments used to determine the allowance for credit losses for loans the allowance for credit losses was calculated by pooling loans of similar credit risk characteristics and credit monitoring procedures the four loan portfolios are classified into seven segments of loans commercial commercial real estate bbcc residential real estate indirect direct and home equity the commercial and commercial real estate loan categories shown on the balance sheet include the same pool of loans as the

allowance is computed using a methodology similar to that used to determine the allowance for credit losses for loans modified to take into account the probability of a drawdown on the commitment the allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments is classified as a liability account on the balance sheet within accrued expenses and other liabilities while the corresponding provision for these credit losses is recorded as a component of other expense the allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments totaled million at december compared to million at december market risk market risk is the risk that the estimated fair value of our assets liabilities and derivative financial instruments will decline as a result of changes in interest rates or financial market volatility or that our net income will be significantly reduced by interest rate changes the objective of our interest rate management process is to maximize net interest income while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity potential cash flows sales or replacement value of many of our assets and liabilities especially those that earn or pay interest are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates this interest rate risk arises primarily from our normal business activities of gathering deposits and extending loans many factors affect our exposure to changes in interest rates such as general economic and financial conditions client preferences historical pricing relationships and repricing characteristics of financial instruments our earnings can also be affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of the us government and its agencies particularly the federal reserve in managing interest rate risk we through our funds management committee a committee of the board of directors establish guidelines for asset and liability management including measurement of short and longterm sensitivities to changes in interest rates based on the results of our analysis we may use different techniques to manage changing trends in interest rates including adjusting balance sheet mix or altering interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities changing product pricing strategies modifying characteristics of the investment securities portfolio or using derivative financial instruments to a limited degree a key element in our ongoing process is to measure and monitor interest rate risk using a model to quantify the likely impact of changing interest rates on old nationals results of operations the model quantifies the effects of various possible interest rate scenarios on projected net interest income the model measures the impact on net interest income relative to a base case scenario the base case scenario assumes that the balance sheet and interest rates are held at current levels interest rates are floored at in the down basis points scenario the model shows our projected net interest income sensitivity based on interest rate changes only and does not consider other forecast assumptions the following table illustrates our projected net interest income sensitivity over a twoyear cumulative horizon based on the assetliability model as of december and table start immediate rate decrease immediate rate increase dollars in thousands

investments and investment securities loans total interest income projected interest expense deposits borrowings total interest expense net interest income change from base change from base table end our asset sensitivity increased year over year primarily due to deposit growth higher mix of floating rate loans and changes in our hedging strategies a key element in the measurement and modeling of interest rate risk is the repricing assumptions of our transaction deposit accounts which have no contractual maturity dates because the models are driven by expected behavior in various interest rate scenarios and many factors besides market interest rates affect our net interest income we recognize that model outputs are not guarantees of actual results for this reason we model many different combinations of interest rates and balance sheet assumptions to understand our overall sensitivity to market interest rate changes including shocks ramps yield curve flattening yield curve steepening as well as forecasts of likely interest rate scenarios tested at december our projected net interest income sensitivity based on the assetliability models we utilize was within the limits of our interest rate risk policy for the scenarios tested we use cash flow and fair value hedges primarily interest rate swaps collars and floors to mitigate interest rate risk derivatives designated as hedging instruments were in a net asset position with a fair value of million at december compared to a net asset position with a fair value of million at december see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivative financial instruments liquidity risk liquidity risk arises from the possibility that we may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments or may become unduly reliant on alternative funding sources the funds management committee of the board of directors establishes liquidity risk guidelines and along with the balance sheet management committee monitors liquidity risk the objective of liquidity management is to ensure we have the ability to fund balance sheet growth and meet deposit and debt obligations in a timely and costeffective manner management monitors liquidity through a regular review of asset and liability maturities funding sources and loan and deposit forecasts we maintain strategic and contingency liquidity plans to ensure sufficient available funding to satisfy requirements for balance sheet growth properly manage capital markets funding sources and to address unexpected liquidity requirements on june we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the sec that permits us to issue an unspecified amount of debt or equity securities loan repayments and maturing investment securities are a relatively predictable source of funds however deposit flows calls of investment securities and prepayments of loans and mortgagerelated securities are strongly influenced by interest rates the

assumptions made are based upon historical experience future forecasts or other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances because of the nature of the judgment and assumptions actual results could differ from estimates which could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations the following accounting policies materially affect our reported earnings and financial condition and require significant judgments and estimates management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with our audit committee goodwill description for acquisitions we are required to record the assets acquired including identified intangible assets such as goodwill and the liabilities assumed at their fair value these often involve estimates based on third party valuations such as appraisals or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques that may include estimates of attrition inflation asset growth rates or other relevant factors the carrying value of goodwill recorded must be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis as well as on an interim basis if events or changes indicate that the asset might be impaired an impairment loss must be recognized for any excess of carrying value over fair value of the goodwill judgments and uncertainties the determination of fair values is based on valuations using managements assumptions of future growth rates future attrition discount rates multiples of earnings or other relevant factors effect if actual results differ from assumptions changes in these factors as well as downturns in economic or business conditions could have a significant adverse impact on the carrying value of goodwill and could result in impairment losses affecting our financial statements as a whole and our banking subsidiary in which the goodwill resides pandemic a prolonged covid19 outbreak or any other epidemic that harms the global economy us economy or the economies in which we operate could adversely affect our operations based on the required annual impairment test as of august we have concluded that our goodwill was not impaired on a quarterly basis we will continue to evaluate our qualitative assessment assumptions which are subject to risks and uncertainties including forecasted revenues expenses and cash flows current discount rates our market capitalization observable market transactions and multiples changes to the regulatory environment and the nature and amount of government support that has been and is expected to be provided in the future a prolonged economic downturn or deterioration in the economic outlook may lead management to conclude that an interim quantitative impairment test of our goodwill is required prior to the annual impairment test conducted on august allowance for credit losses for loans description the allowance for credit losses for loans represents managements estimate of all expected credit losses over the expected contractual life of our loan portfolio determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain subsequent evaluations of the thenexisting loan portfolio in light of the factors then prevailing may result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses in those future periods the allowance for credit losses for loans as reported in our consolidated statements of financial condition is adjusted by an expense for credit losses which is recognized in earnings and reduced by the chargeoff of loan amounts net of recoveries judgments and uncertainties we utilize a discounted cashflow approach to determine the allowance for credit losses for performing loans and nonperforming loans expected cashflows are created for each loan and discounted using the effective yield method the discounted sum of expected cashflows is then compared to the amortized cost and any shortfall is recorded as reserve expected cashflows are created using a combination of contractual payment schedules calculated pds lgd and prepayment assumptions as well as qualitative factors for the commercial and commercial real estate loans the pd is forecast using a regression model to determine the likelihood of a loan moving into nonaccrual within the time horizon for residential and consumer loans the pd is forecast using a regression model to determine the likelihood of a loan being chargedoff within the time horizon the regression models use combinations of variables to assess systematic and unsystematic risk variables used for unsystematic risk are borrower specific and help to gauge the risk of default from an individual borrower variables for systematic risk risk inherent to all borrowers come from the use of forwardlooking economic forecasts and include variables such as unemployment rate gross domestic product and house price index the lgd is defined as credit loss incurred when an obligor of the bank defaults qualitative factors include items such as changes in lending policies or procedures and economic uncertainty in forwardlooking forecasts effect if actual results differ from assumptions the allowance represents managements best estimate but significant downturns in circumstances relating to loan quality and economic conditions could result in a requirement for additional allowance likewise an upturn in loan quality and improved economic conditions may allow a reduction in the required allowance in either instance unanticipated changes could have a significant impact on results of operations one of the most significant judgments used in determining the allowance for credit losses is the macroeconomic forecast provided by a third party the economic indices sourced from the macroeconomic forecast and used in projecting loss rates include the national unemployment rate changes in commercial real estate prices changes in home values and changes in the united states gross domestic product the economic index used in the calculation to which the calculation may be most sensitive is the national unemployment rate each reporting period several macroeconomic forecast scenarios are considered by management management selects the macroeconomic forecast that is most reflective of expectations at that point in time changes in the macroeconomic forecast especially for the national unemployment rate could significantly impact the calculated estimated credit losses the expense for credit loss recorded through earnings is the amount necessary to maintain the allowance for credit losses at the amount of expected credit losses inherent within the loans held for investment portfolio the amount of expense and the corresponding level of allowance for credit losses for loans are based on our evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio based on historical loss experience reasonable and supportable forecasts and other significant qualitative and quantitative factors derivative financial instruments description as part of our overall interest rate risk management we use derivative instruments to reduce exposure to changes in interest rates and market prices for financial instruments the application of the hedge accounting policy requires judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness identification of similar hedged item groupings and measurement of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments and hedged items to the extent hedging relationships are found to be effective changes in fair value of the derivatives are offset by changes in the fair value of the related hedged item or recorded to other comprehensive income management believes hedge effectiveness is evaluated properly in preparation of the financial statements all of the derivative financial instruments we use have an active market and indications of fair value can be readily obtained we are not using the shortcut method of accounting for any fair value derivatives judgments and uncertainties the application of the hedge accounting policy requires judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness identification of similar hedged item groupings and measurement of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments and hedged items effect if actual results differ from assumptions to the extent hedging relationships are found to be effective changes in fair value of the derivatives are offset by changes in the fair value of the related hedged item or recorded to other comprehensive income however if in the future the derivative financial instruments used by us no longer qualify for hedge accounting treatment all changes in fair value of the derivative would flow through the consolidated statements of income in other noninterest income resulting in greater volatility in our earnings income taxes description we are subject to the income tax laws of the us its states and the municipalities in which we operate these tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant government taxing authorities we review income tax expense and the carrying value of deferred tax assets quarterly and as new information becomes available the balances are adjusted as appropriate fasb asc fin prescribes a recognition threshold of morelikelythannot and a measurement attribute for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return in order for those tax positions to be recognized in the financial statements see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of our provision and related income tax assets and liabilities judgments and uncertainties in establishing a provision for income tax expense we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws we must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be subject to reviewadjudication by the court systems of the various tax jurisdictions or may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit effect if actual results differ from assumptions although management believes that the judgments and estimates used are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material to the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected an unfavorable tax settlement would result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution a favorable tax settlement would result in a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to it in this managements
