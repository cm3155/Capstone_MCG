financial measures the companys accounting and reporting policies conform to gaap and general practices within the banking industry as a supplement to gaap the company provides nongaap performance results which the company believes are useful because they assist investors in assessing the companys operating performance where nongaap financial measures are used the comparable gaap financial measure as well as the reconciliation to the comparable gaap financial measure can be found in the following table the taxequivalent adjustment to net interest income and net interest margin recognizes the income tax savings when comparing taxable and taxexempt assets interest income and yields on taxexempt securities and loans are presented using the current federal income tax rate of management believes that it is standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest income and net interest margin on a fully taxequivalent basis and that it may enhance comparability for peer comparison purposes in managements view tangible common equity measures are capital adequacy metrics that may be meaningful to the company as well as analysts and investors in assessing the companys use of equity and in facilitating comparisons with peers these nongaap measures are valuable indicators of a financial institutions capital strength since they eliminate intangible assets from shareholders equity and retain the effect of accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders equity although intended to enhance investors understanding of the companys business and performance these nongaap financial measures should not be considered an alternative to gaap in addition these nongaap financial measures may differ from those used by other financial institutions to

measures section for reconciliations to gaap financial measures net interest income net interest income is the most significant component of our earnings comprising of revenues for the six months ended june net interest income and net interest margin are influenced by many factors primarily the volume and mix of earning assets funding sources and interest rate fluctuations other factors include the level of accretion income on purchased loans prepayment risk on mortgage and investmentrelated assets and the composition and maturity of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities interest rates increased significantly during the second quarter of with the rate on the 2year us treasury increasing from to the federal reserves federal funds rate increased basis points to a target range of to with the effective federal funds rate at at june the federal reserve is expected to continue to increase the federal funds rate throughout and into if interest rates increase our interest rate spread may improve which may result in an increase in our net interest income if interest rates decline our interest rate spread could decline which may result in a decrease in our net interest income however management has taken balance sheet restructuring derivative and deposit pricing actions to help mitigate this risk loans typically generate more interest income than investment securities with similar maturities funding from client deposits generally costs less than wholesale funding sources factors such as general economic activity federal reserve monetary policy and price volatility of competing alternative investments can also exert significant influence on our ability to optimize our mix of assets and funding net interest income and net interest margin net interest income is the excess of interest received from interestearning assets over interest paid on interestbearing liabilities for analytical purposes net interest income is presented in the table that follows adjusted to a taxable equivalent basis to reflect what our taxexempt assets would need to yield in order to achieve the same aftertax yield as a taxable asset we used the federal statutory tax rate in effect of for all periods this analysis portrays the income tax benefits related to taxexempt assets and helps to facilitate a comparison between taxable and taxexempt assets management believes that it is a standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest margin and net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis therefore management believes these measures provide useful information for both management and investors by allowing them to make better peer comparisons the following tables present the average balance sheet for each major asset

ended june and million and million respectively during the six months ended june using the federal statutory rate in effect of the increase in net interest income for the three and six months ended june when compared to the same periods in was primarily due to higher average earning assets as a result of the merger loan growth higher rates higher accretion income and lower costs of average

continued loan growth in future periods a decline in our current level of recoveries or an increase in chargeoffs could result in an increase in provision expense additionally provision expense may be volatile due to changes in cecl model assumptions of credit quality macroeconomic factors and conditions and loan composition which drive the allowance for credit losses balance noninterest income we

of a historic building or completion of a solar project within the reporting period many factors including weather labor availability building regulations inspections and other unexpected construction delays related to a rehabilitation project can cause a project to exceed its estimated completion date see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our tax credit investments provision for income taxes we record a provision for income taxes currently payable and for income taxes payable or benefits to be received in the future which arise due to timing differences in the recognition of certain items for financial statement and income tax purposes the major difference between the effective tax rate applied to our financial statement income and the federal statutory tax rate is caused by a tax benefit from our tax credit investments and interest on taxexempt securities and loans the provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income loss was for the three months ended june compared to for the same period in the provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income loss was for the six months ended june compared to for the

expected that we would be required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery the investment securities availableforsale portfolio had net unrealized losses of million at june compared

commercial commercial and industrial loans are made primarily for the purpose of financing equipment acquisition expansion working capital and other general business purposes lease financing consists of direct financing leases and is used by commercial clients to finance capital purchases ranging from computer equipment to transportation equipment the credit decisions for these transactions are based upon an assessment of the overall financial capacity of the applicant a determination is made as to the applicants ability to repay in accordance with the proposed terms as well as an overall assessment of the risks involved in addition to an evaluation of the applicants financial condition a determination is made of the probable adequacy of the primary and secondary sources of repayment such as additional collateral or personal guarantees to be relied upon in the transaction credit agency reports of the applicants credit history supplement the analysis of the applicants creditworthiness commercial mortgages and construction loans are offered to real estate investors developers and builders primarily domiciled in the geographic market areas we serve illinois indiana iowa kentucky michigan minnesota wisconsin and missouri these loans are secured by first mortgages on real estate at ltv margins deemed appropriate for the property type quality location and sponsorship generally these ltv ratios do not exceed the commercial properties are predominantly nonresidential properties such as retail centers industrial properties and to a lesser extent more specialized properties substantially all of our commercial real estate loans are secured by properties located in our primary market area in the underwriting of our commercial real estate loans we obtain appraisals for the underlying properties decisions to lend are based on the economic viability of the property and the creditworthiness of the borrower in evaluating a proposed commercial real estate loan we primarily emphasize the ratio of the propertys projected net cash flows to the loans debt service requirement the debt service coverage ratio normally is not less than and it is computed after deduction for a vacancy factor and property expenses as appropriate in addition a personal guarantee of the loan or a portion thereof is often required from the principals of the borrower in most cases we require title insurance insuring the priority of our lien fire and extended coverage casualty insurance and flood insurance if appropriate in order to protect our security interest in the underlying property in addition business interruption insurance or other insurance may be required construction loans are underwritten against projected cash flows derived from rental income business income from an owneroccupant or the sale of the property to an enduser we may mitigate the risks associated with these types of loans by requiring fixedprice construction contracts performance and payment bonding controlled disbursements and presale contracts or prelease agreements consumer we offer a variety of first mortgage and junior lien loans to consumers within our markets with residential home mortgages comprising our largest consumer loan category these loans are secured by a primary residence and are underwritten using traditional underwriting systems to assess the credit risks of the consumer decisions are primarily based on ltv ratios dti ratios liquidity and credit scores a maximum ltv ratio of is generally required although higher levels are permitted with mortgage insurance or other mitigating factors we offer fixed rate mortgages and variable rate mortgages with interest rates that are subject to change every year after the first third fifth or seventh year depending on the product and are based on indexed rates such as prime we do not offer paymentoption facilities subprime loans or any product with negative amortization home equity loans are secured primarily by second mortgages on residential property of the borrower the underwriting terms for the home equity product generally permit borrowing availability in the aggregate up to of the appraised value of the collateral property at the time of origination we offer fixed and variable rate home equity loans with variable rate loans underwritten at fullyindexed rates decisions are primarily based on ltv ratios dti ratios and credit scores we do not offer home equity loan products with reduced documentation automobile loans include loans and leases secured by new or used automobiles we originate automobile loans and leases primarily on an indirect basis through selected dealerships we require borrowers to maintain collision insurance on automobiles securing consumer loans with us listed as loss payee our procedures for underwriting automobile loans include an assessment of an applicants overall financial capacity including credit history and the ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan although an applicants creditworthiness is the primary consideration the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral security to the proposed loan amount asset quality communitybased lending personnel along with regionbased independent underwriting and analytic support staff extend credit under guidelines established and administered by management and overseen by our enterprise risk committee this committee which meets quarterly is made up of independent outside directors the committee monitors credit quality through its review of information such as delinquencies credit exposures peer comparisons problem loans and chargeoffs in addition the committee provides oversight of loan policy changes as recommended by management to assure our policy remains appropriate for the current lending environment we lend to commercial and commercial real estate clients in many diverse industries including among others manufacturing agribusiness transportation mining wholesaling and retailing old national manages concentrations of credit exposure by industry product geography client relationship and loan size at june our average commercial loan size was approximately and our average commercial real estate loan size was approximately in addition while loans to lessors of residential and nonresidential real estate exceed of total loans no individual subsegment category within those broader categories reaches the threshold at june we had minimal exposure to foreign borrowers and no sovereign debt our policy is to concentrate our lending activity in the geographic market areas we serve primarily illinois indiana iowa kentucky michigan minnesota wisconsin and missouri on february old national closed on its merger with first midwest as of the closing date of the transaction first midwest loans totaled billion old national reviewed the acquired loans and

criticized and classified assets related to the first midwest merger totaled million at june other classified assets include investment securities that fell below investment grade rating totaling million at june compared to million at june and million at december old national may choose to restructure the contractual terms of certain loans the decision to restructure a loan versus aggressively enforcing the collection of the loan may benefit old national by increasing the ultimate probability of collection any loans that are modified are reviewed by old national to identify if a tdr has occurred which is when for economic or legal reasons related to a borrowers financial difficulties old national bank grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider terms may be modified to fit the ability of the borrower to repay in line with its current financial status the modification of the terms of such loans includes one or a combination of the following a reduction of the stated interest rate of the loan an extension of the maturity date at a stated rate of interest lower than the current market rate of new debt with similar risk or a permanent reduction of the recorded investment of the loan loans modified in a tdr are typically placed on nonaccrual status until we determine that the future collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured which generally requires that the borrower demonstrate a period of performance according to the restructured terms for six months if we are unable to resolve a nonperforming loan issue the credit will be charged off when it is apparent there will be a loss for large commercial type loans each relationship is individually analyzed for evidence of apparent loss based on quantitative benchmarks or subjectively based upon certain events or particular circumstances for residential and consumer loans a charge off is recorded at the time foreclosure is initiated or when the loan becomes to days past due whichever is earlier for commercial tdrs an allocation is established within the allowance for credit losses for the difference between the carrying value of the loan and its computed value to determine the computed value of the loan one of the following methods is selected the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loans original effective interest rate the loans observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent the allocation is established as the difference between the carrying value of the loan and the collectable value if there are significant changes in the amount or timing of the loans expected future cash flows the allowance allocation is recalculated and adjusted accordingly when a residential or consumer loan is identified as a tdr the loan is typically written down to its collateral value less selling costs at june tdrs totaled million million of which were included within nonaccrual loans at december tdrs totaled million million of which were included within nonaccrual loans old national has established specific allowances for credit losses for clients whose loan terms have been modified as tdrs totaling million at june and million of december old national had not committed to lend any additional funds to clients with outstanding loans that were classified as tdrs at june or december the terms of certain other loans were modified during and that did not meet the definition of a tdr it is our process to review all classified and criticized loans that during the period have been renewed have entered into a forbearance agreement have gone from principal and interest to interest only or have extended the maturity date in order to determine whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty an evaluation is performed of the probability that the borrower will be in payment default on its debt in the foreseeable future without the modification the evaluation is performed under our internal underwriting policy we also evaluate whether a concession has been granted or if we were adequately compensated through a market interest rate additional collateral or a bona fide guarantee we also consider whether the modification was insignificant relative to the other terms of the agreement or the delay in a payment in general once a modified loan is considered a tdr the loan will always be considered a tdr until it is paid in full otherwise settled sold or charged off however guidance also permits for loans to be removed from tdr status when subsequently restructured under these circumstances at the time of the subsequent restructuring the borrower is not experiencing financial difficulties and this is documented by a current credit evaluation at the time of the restructuring under the terms of the subsequent restructuring agreement the institution has granted no concession to the borrower and the subsequent restructuring agreement includes market terms that are no less favorable than those that would be offered for a comparable new loan for loans subsequently restructured that have cumulative principal forgiveness the loan should continue to be measured in accordance with asc receivables overall however consistent with asc troubled debt restructurings by creditors creditor disclosure of troubled debt restructurings the loan would not be required to be reported in the years following the restructuring if the subsequent restructuring meets both of these criteria has an interest rate at the time of the subsequent restructuring that is not less than a market interest rate and is performing in compliance with its modified terms after the subsequent restructuring allowance for credit losses on loans and unfunded commitments net chargeoffs on loans totaled million during the three months ended june compared to net recoveries of million for the same period in annualized net chargeoffs recoveries to average loans were for the three months ended june compared to for the same period in net chargeoffs on loans totaled million during the six months ended june compared to net recoveries of million during the same period in annualized net chargeoffs recoveries to average loans were for the six months ended june compared to for the same period in management will continue its efforts to reduce the level of nonperforming loans and may consider the possibility of sales of troubled and nonperforming loans which could result in additional chargeoffs to the allowance for credit losses on loans credit quality within the loans held for investment portfolio is continuously monitored by management and is reflected within the allowance for credit losses for loans the allowance for credit losses is an estimate of expected losses inherent within the companys loans held for investment portfolio credit quality is assessed and monitored by evaluating various attributes and the results of those evaluations are utilized in underwriting new loans and in our process for estimating expected credit losses expected credit loss inherent in noncancelable offbalancesheet credit exposures is accounted for as a separate liability included in other liabilities on the balance sheet the allowance for credit losses for loans held for investment is adjusted by a credit loss expense which is reported in earnings and reduced by the chargeoff of loan amounts net of recoveries accrued interest receivable is excluded from the estimate of credit losses the allowance for credit loss estimation process involves procedures to appropriately consider the unique characteristics of our loan portfolio segments these segments are further disaggregated into loan classes based on the level at which credit risk of the loan is monitored when computing the level of expected credit losses credit loss assumptions are estimated using a model that categorizes loan pools based on loss history delinquency status and other credit trends and risk characteristics including current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain in future periods evaluations of the overall loan portfolio in light of the factors and forecasts then prevailing may result in significant changes in the allowance and credit loss expense in those future periods the allowance level is influenced by loan volumes loan aqr migration or delinquency status changes in historical loss experience and other conditions influencing loss expectations such as reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions the methodology for estimating the amount of expected credit losses reported in the allowance for credit losses has two basic components first an assetspecific component involving individual loans that do not share risk characteristics with other loans and the measurement of expected credit losses for such individual loans and second a pooled component for estimated expected credit losses for pools of loans that share similar risk characteristics the allowance for credit losses for loans was million at june compared to million at december the increase reflects the initial allowance for credit losses established for acquired pcd loans totaling million related to the first midwest merger in addition the provision for credit losses expense in the six months ended june included million of provision for credit losses to establish an allowance for credit losses on nonpcd loans acquired in the first midwest merger continued loan growth in future periods a decline in our current level of recoveries or an increase in chargeoffs could result in an increase in provision expense additionally provision expense may be volatile due to changes in cecl model assumptions of credit quality macroeconomic factors and conditions and loan composition which drive the allowance for credit losses balance we maintain an allowance for credit losses on unfunded commercial lending commitments and letters of credit to provide for the risk of loss inherent in these arrangements the allowance is computed using a methodology similar to that used to determine the allowance for credit losses for loans modified to take into account the probability of a drawdown on the commitment the allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments is classified as a liability account on the balance sheet within accrued expenses and other liabilities while the corresponding provision for these credit losses is recorded as a component of other expense the allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments totaled million at june compared to million at december the increase in the allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments was primarily driven by the merger with first midwest market risk market risk is the risk that the estimated fair value of our assets liabilities and derivative financial instruments will decline as a result of changes in interest rates or financial market volatility or that our net income will be significantly reduced by interest rate changes the objective of our interest rate management process is to maximize net interest income while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity potential cash flows sales or replacement value of many of our assets and liabilities especially those that earn or pay interest are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates this interest rate risk arises primarily from our normal business activities of gathering deposits and extending loans many factors affect our exposure to changes in interest rates such as general economic and financial conditions client preferences historical pricing relationships and repricing characteristics of financial instruments our earnings can also be affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of the us government and its agencies particularly the federal reserve in managing interest rate risk we establish guidelines for asset and liability management including measurement of short and longterm sensitivities to changes in interest rates which is reviewed with the enterprise risk committee of our board of directors based on the results of our analysis we may use different techniques to manage changing trends in interest rates including adjusting balance sheet mix or altering interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities changing product pricing strategies modifying characteristics of the investment securities portfolio or using derivative financial instruments to a limited degree a key element in our ongoing process is to measure and monitor interest rate risk using a model to quantify the likely impact of changing interest rates on old nationals results of operations the model quantifies the effects of various possible interest rate scenarios on projected net interest income the model measures the impact on net interest income relative to a base case scenario the base case scenario assumes that the balance sheet and interest rates are held at current levels the model shows our projected net interest income sensitivity based on interest rate changes only and does not consider other forecast assumptions the following table illustrates our projected net interest income sensitivity over a two year cumulative horizon based on the assetliability model at june and immediate rate decrease immediate rate increase dollars in thousands basis points base basis points basis points basis points june projected interest income money market other interest earning investments and investment securities loans total interest income projected interest expense deposits borrowings total interest expense net interest income change from base change from base june projected interest income money market other interest earning investments and investment securities loans total interest income projected interest expense deposits borrowings total interest expense net interest income change from base change from base our projected net interest income increased year over year due to the first midwest merger loan growth and rising interest rates a key element in the measurement and modeling of interest rate risk is the repricing assumptions of our transaction deposit accounts which have no contractual maturity dates because the models are driven by expected behavior in various interest rate scenarios and many factors besides market interest rates affect our net interest income we recognize that model outputs are not guarantees of actual results for this reason we model many different combinations of interest rates and balance sheet assumptions to understand our overall sensitivity to market interest rate changes including shocks ramps yield curve flattening yield curve steepening as well as forecasts of likely interest rate scenarios tested at june our projected net interest income sensitivity based on the assetliability models we utilize was within the limits of our interest rate risk policy for the scenarios tested we use cash flow and fair value hedges primarily interest rate swaps collars and floors to mitigate interest rate risk derivatives designated as hedging instruments were in a net liability position with a fair value loss of million at june compared to a net asset position with a fair value gain of million at december see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivative financial instruments liquidity risk liquidity risk arises from the possibility that we may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments or may become unduly reliant on alternative funding sources we establish liquidity risk guidelines that we review with the enterprise risk committee of our board of directors and monitor through our balance sheet management committee the objective of liquidity management is to ensure we have the ability to fund balance sheet growth and meet deposit and debt obligations in a timely and costeffective manner management monitors liquidity through a regular review of asset and liability maturities funding sources and loan and deposit forecasts we maintain strategic and contingency liquidity plans to ensure sufficient available funding to satisfy requirements for balance sheet growth properly manage capital markets funding sources and to address unexpected liquidity requirements on june we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the sec that permits us to issue an unspecified amount of debt or equity securities loan repayments and maturing investment securities are a relatively predictable source of funds however deposit flows calls of investment securities and prepayments of loans and mortgagerelated securities are strongly influenced by interest rates the housing market general and local economic conditions and competition in the marketplace we continually monitor marketplace trends to identify patterns that might improve the predictability of the timing of deposit flows or asset prepayments a maturity schedule for old national banks time deposits is shown in the following table at june  in thousands

accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december certain of these accounting policies require management to use significant judgment and estimates which can have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities we consider these policies to be our critical accounting estimates the judgment and assumptions made are based upon historical experience future forecasts or other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances because of the nature of the judgment and assumptions actual results could differ from estimates which could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations business combinations and goodwill description for acquisitions we are required to record the assets acquired including identified intangible assets such as core deposit and customer trust relationship intangibles and the liabilities assumed at their fair value the difference between consideration and the net fair value of assets acquired is recorded as goodwill management uses significant estimates and assumptions to value such items including projected cash flows repayment rates default rates and losses assuming default discount rates and realizable collateral values the allowance for credit losses for pcd loans is recognized within acquisition accounting the allowance for credit losses for nonpcd assets is recognized as provision for credit losses in the same reporting period as the acquisition fair value adjustments are amortized or accreted into the income statement over the estimated life of the acquired assets or assumed liabilities the purchase date valuations and any subsequent adjustments determine the amount of goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition the use of different assumptions could produce significantly different valuation results which could have material positive or negative effects on our results of operations the carrying value of goodwill recorded must be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis as well as on an interim basis if events or changes indicate that the asset might be impaired an impairment loss must be recognized for any excess of carrying value over fair value of the goodwill judgments and uncertainties the determination of fair values is based on valuations using managements assumptions of future growth rates future attrition discount rates multiples of earnings or other relevant factors in addition we engage third party specialists to assist in the development of fair values preliminary estimates of fair values may be adjusted for a period of time subsequent to the acquisition date if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that if known would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date adjustments recorded during this period are recognized in the current reporting period management uses various valuation methodologies to estimate the fair value of these assets and liabilities and often involves a significant degree of judgment particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the particular item being valued examples of such items include loans deposits identifiable intangible assets and certain other assets and liabilities effect if actual results differ from assumptions changes in these factors as well as downturns in economic or business conditions could have a significant adverse impact on the carrying value of assets including goodwill and liabilities which could result in impairment losses affecting our financial statements as a whole and our banking subsidiary in which the goodwill resides pandemic a prolonged covid19 pandemic or any other epidemic that harms the global economy us economy or the economies in which we operate could adversely affect our operations goodwill is especially susceptible to risk of impairment during prolonged periods of economic downturn for additional information regarding critical accounting estimates see the section titled critical accounting estimates
