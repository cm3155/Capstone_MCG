continue to assess future opportunities of financial companies using these criteria based on market and other conditions competition our profitability depends principally on our ability to compete effectively in the markets in which we conduct business in the financial services industry market demands technological and regulatory changes and economic pressures have increased competition among banks as well as other financial institutions competition may further intensify as additional companies enter the markets where we conduct business and we enter mature markets in accordance with our expansion strategy we experience strong competition from both bank and nonbank competitors we compete with national banks superregional banks smaller community banks nontraditional internet based banks credit unions insurance companies and government sponsored entities we also compete with other financial intermediaries and investment alternatives such as mortgage companies credit card issuers leasing companies finance companies money market mutual funds brokerage firms governmental and corporation bonds and other securities firms we encounter strong competition in making loans and attracting deposits we compete with other financial institutions to offer customers competitive interest rates on deposit accounts competitive interest rates charged on loans and other credit products and reasonable service charges in addition we also compete based on the quality and scope of the services we provide and the convenience of our banking facilities compared to our competitors the larger national and superregional banks may have significantly greater lending limits and may offer additional products however by emphasizing customer service and by providing a wide variety of services we believe that our bank has generally been able to compete successfully with our competitors regardless of their size technological advances have made it possible for our competitors including nonbank competitors to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products and for financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internetbased financial solutions including online deposit accounts electronic payment processing and marketplace lending without having a physical presence where their customers are located in addition many of our nonbank competitors are not subject to the same extensive federal regulations that govern bank holding companies and federally insured banks in many cases our competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits and offer certain services that we do not currently provide legislation has continued to heighten the competitive environment in which financial institutions must conduct their business and the potential for competition among financial institutions of all types has increased significantly to compete we rely upon specialized services responsive handling of customer

we led by our business continuity team continue to evaluate the changing covid19 landscape and consider processes that reduce the risk to our employees customers and vendors while continuing to provide essential banking services effect of governmental policies our earnings and business are and will be affected by the policies of various regulatory authorities of the united states especially the federal reserve the federal reserve among other things seeks to influence interest rates and the supply of money and credit within the united states among the traditional methods that have been used to achieve this objective are open market operations in us government securities changes in the discount rate for bank borrowings expanded access to funds for nonbanks and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits the federal reserve has as a response to the financial crisis steeply increased the size of its balance sheet by buying securities and has paid interest on excess reserves held by banks at the federal reserve both the traditional and more recent methods are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans investments and deposits interest rates on loans and securities and rates paid for deposits the monetary policies of the federal reserve have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks and are expected to continue to do so in the future the monetary policies of the federal reserve are influenced by various factors including inflation unemployment and shortterm and longterm changes in the international trade balance and in the fiscal policies of the us government following a prolonged period in which the federal funds rate was stable or decreasing the federal reserve began to increase this benchmark rate but has more recently decreased its target federal funds rate to near zero in response to the covid19 pandemic in addition since the period during which the federal reserve increased the size of its balance sheet substantially above historical levels through the purchase of debt securities the federal reserve has started to vary the size of its balance sheet which might also affect interest rates future monetary policies including whether the federal reserve will increase or decrease the federal funds rate and whether or at what pace it will reduce or increase the size of its balance sheet and the effect of such policies on the future business and earnings of the company and our subsidiary bank cannot be predicted supervision and regulation we are extensively regulated under federal and state law the following is a brief summary of certain aspects of that regulation that are material to us and does not purport to be a complete description of all regulations that affect us or all aspects of those regulations to the extent particular statutory and regulatory provisions are described the description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statute or regulation proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the banking industry are frequently raised at both the state and federal levels the likelihood and timing of any changes in these laws and regulations and the impact such changes may have on the company and the bank are difficult to ascertain in addition to laws and regulations bank regulatory agencies may issue policy statements interpretive letters and similar written guidance applicable to the company or the bank a change in applicable laws regulations or regulatory guidance or in the manner such laws regulations or regulatory guidance are interpreted by regulatory agencies or courts may have a material adverse effect on the companys and the banks business operations and earnings supervision regulation and examination of banks by regulatory agencies are intended primarily for the protection of depositors and customers the deposit insurance fund and the us banking and financial system rather than shareholders both the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which we are subject have increased in recent years in response to the financial crisis as well as other factors such as technological and market changes as described in further detail below the company and the bank have become subject to additional regulatory requirements as a result of the growth of their assets regulatory enforcement and fines have also increased across the banking and financial services sector many of these changes have occurred as a result of the doddfrank act wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act and its implementing regulations while there have been some changes in the post financial crisis framework applicable to the company the company expects that its business will remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision it is possible that the intensity of regulation and supervision will be higher in the biden administration we are also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the securities act of as amended and the securities exchange act of as amended both as administered by the sec as well as the rules of nasdaq that apply to companies with securities listed on the nasdaq global select market regulation of the company we are registered as a bank holding company with the federal reserve under the bank holding company act of the bhc act and have elected to be a financial holding company as a financial holding company we are subject to comprehensive regulation examination and supervision by the federal reserve and are subject to its regulatory reporting requirements federal law subjects financial holding companies such as the company to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations as a financial holding company we are permitted to engage in and be affiliated with companies engaging in a broader range of activities than those permitted for a bank holding company bank holding companies are generally restricted to engaging in the business of banking managing or controlling banks and certain other activities determined by the federal reserve to be related closely to banking financial holding companies may also engage in activities that are considered to be financial in nature as well as those incidental or complementary to financial activities including certain insurance underwriting activities we and the bank must each remain wellcapitalized and wellmanaged and the bank must receive a community reinvestment act cra rating of at least satisfactory at its most recent examination in order for us to maintain our status as a financial holding company in addition the federal reserve has the power to order a financial holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when it has reasonable cause to believe that continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety soundness or stability of any bank subsidiary of that financial holding company a financial holding company is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank and to maintain resources adequate to support its bank the term source of financial strength has been defined as the ability of a company to provide financial assistance to its insured depository institution subsidiaries in the event of financial distress the appropriate federal banking agency for the depository institution in this case the office of the comptroller of the currency or occ may require reports from the company to assess its ability to serve as a source of strength and to enforce compliance with the sourceofstrength requirements by requiring the holding company to provide financial assistance to the bank if its capital were to become impaired if the company fails to provide such assistance within three months it could be ordered to sell its stock of the bank to cover the deficiency any capital loans by the company to the bank would be subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other debts of the bank in the event of the companys bankruptcy any commitment by the company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of the bank would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment the bhc act requires that a financial holding company obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve before i acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the voting shares of any additional bank or bank holding company ii taking any action that causes an additional bank or bank holding company to become a subsidiary of the financial holding company or iii merging or consolidating with any other bank holding company the federal reserve may not approve any such transaction that would result in a monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any section of the united states or the effect of which may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly in any section of the country or that in any other manner would be in restraint of trade unless the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served the federal reserve is also required to consider the financial and managerial resources of the companies involved including pro forma capital ratios the risk to the stability of the united states banking or financial system the convenience and needs of the communities to be served including the companies performance under the cra and the effectiveness of the companies in combatting money laundering we are permitted under applicable federal and state law to make out of state acquisitions and mergers of other banks and bank holding companies subject to the requirements summarized above federal law restricts the amount of voting stock of a bank holding company and a bank that a person may acquire without the prior approval of banking regulators the overall effect of such laws is to make it more difficult to acquire a bank holding company and a bank by tender offer or similar means than it might be to acquire control of another type of corporation consequently shareholders of the company may be less likely to benefit from the rapid increases in stock prices that may result from tender offers or similar efforts to acquire control of other companies federal law also imposes restrictions on acquisitions of stock in a bank holding company or a national bank under the federal change in bank control act and the regulations thereunder a person or group must give advance notice to the federal reserve before acquiring control of any bank holding company such as the company and the occ before acquiring control of any national bank such as the bank upon receipt of such notice the bank regulatory agencies may approve or disapprove the acquisition the change in bank control act creates a rebuttable presumption of control if a member or group acquires a certain percentage or more of a bank holding companys or banks voting stock or if one or more other control factors set forth in the act are present as a result a person or entity generally must provide prior notice to the federal reserve before acquiring the power to vote or more of our outstanding common stock investors should be aware of these requirements when acquiring shares of our stock regulation of the bank the bank is a national bank subject to comprehensive regulation examination and supervision by the occ and is subject to its regulatory reporting

deposits of the bank are insured by the fdic up to the limits under applicable law which currently are set at for accounts under the same name and title the bank is subject to deposit insurance premium assessments the fdic imposes a riskbased deposit premium assessment system under this system the assessment rates for an insured depository institution vary according to the level of risk incurred in its activities to arrive at an assessment rate for a banking institution the fdic places it in one of four risk categories determined by reference to its capital levels and supervisory ratings in the case of those institutions in the lowest risk category the fdic further determines its assessment rate based on certain specified financial ratios or if applicable longterm debt ratings the assessment rate schedule can change from time to time at the discretion of the fdic subject to certain limits under the current system premiums are assessed quarterly the fdic has published guidelines on the adjustment of assessment rates for certain institutions in addition insured depository institutions have been required to pay a pro rata portion of the interest due on the obligations issued by the financing corporation to fund the closing and disposal of failed thrift institutions by the resolution trust corporation the fdic uses a performance score and lossseverity score to calculate the banks initial fdic assessment rate in calculating these scores the fdic uses the banks capital level and regulatory supervisory ratings and certain financial measures to assess the banks ability to withstand assetrelated and funding related stress and make certain adjustments based on risk factors that are not adequately captured in these calculations insurance of deposits may be terminated by the fdic upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law regulation rule order or condition imposed by a banks federal regulatory agency deposits and certain claims for administrative expenses and employee compensation against insured depository institutions are afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution including federal funds and letters of credit in the liquidation or other resolution of that institution by any receiver appointed by federal authorities these priority creditors include the fdic dividend restrictions the company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other subsidiaries and has in the past relied on dividends from the bank as its primary source of liquidity there are limitations on the payment of dividends by the bank to the company as well as by the company to its shareholders the occ has the general authority to limit the dividends paid by the bank if such payment may be deemed to constitute an unsafe and unsound practice the bank may not pay dividends from its paidin surplus all dividends must be paid out of undivided profits then on hand after deducting expenses including reserves for losses and bad debts in addition a national bank such as the bank is prohibited from declaring a dividend on its shares of common stock until its surplus equals its stated capital unless there has been transferred to surplus no less than onetenth of the banks net profits of the preceding two consecutive halfyear periods in the case of an annual dividend the approval of the occ is required if the total of all dividends declared by a national bank in any calendar year exceeds the total of its net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years less any required transfers to surplus we and the bank must maintain the applicable common equity tier cet1 capital conservation buffer of to avoid becoming subject to restrictions on capital distributions including dividends for more information on the cet1 capital conservation buffer see part i item supervision and regulation capital requirements in addition federal reserve policy provides that bank holding companies such as the company should generally pay dividends to shareholders only if i the organizations net income available to common shareholders over the past year has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends ii the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organizations capital needs asset quality and overall financial condition and iii the organization will continue to meet minimum capital adequacy ratios the policy also provides that a bank holding company should inform the federal reserve reasonably in advance of declaring or paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period for which the dividend is being paid or that could result in a material adverse change to the bank holding companys capital structure bank holding companies also are required to consult with the federal reserve before increasing dividends or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments additionally the federal reserve could prohibit or limit the payment of dividends by a bank holding company if it determines that payment of the dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice capital requirements we are required under federal law to maintain certain minimum capital levels at each of the company and the bank the federal banking agencies have issued substantially similar riskbased and leverage capital requirements to banking organizations they supervise under these requirements the company and the bank are required to maintain certain capital standards based on ratios of capital to total assets and capital to riskweighted assets the requirements also define the weights assigned to assets and offbalance sheet items to determine the riskweighted asset components of the riskbased capital rules the required capital ratios are minimums and the federal reserve and occ may determine that a banking organization based on its size complexity or risk profile must maintain a higher level of capital in order to operate in a safe and sound manner risks such as concentration of credit risks and the risk arising from nontraditional activities as well as the institutions exposure to a decline in the economic value of its capital due to changes in interest rates and an institutions ability to manage those risks are important factors that are to be taken into account by the federal banking agencies in assessing an institutions overall capital adequacy under the applicable capital rules the company and the bank are subject to the following riskbased capital ratios a cet1 riskbased capital ratio a tier riskbased capital ratio which includes cet1 and additional tier capital and a total capital ratio which includes tier and tier capital cet1 is primarily comprised of the sum of common stock instruments and related surplus net of treasury stock retained

if applicable upon the completion of the company merger with csfl in june the companys trust preferred securities no longer qualify as tier capital tier capital consists of instruments disqualified from tier capital including qualifying subordinated debt certain trust preferred securities other preferred stock and certain hybrid capital instruments and a limited amount of loan loss reserves up to a maximum of of riskweighted assets subject to certain eligibility criteria for institutions such as us that have exercised an optout election regarding the treatment of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci up to of net unrealized gains on availableforsale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values are also included in tier capital the capital rules also define the riskweights assigned to assets and offbalance sheet items to determine the riskweighted asset components of the riskbased capital rules including for example high volatility commercial real estate past due assets structured securities and equity holdings the capital rules require a minimum cet1 riskbased capital ratio of a minimum overall tier riskbased capital ratio of and a total riskbased capital ratio of in addition the capital rules require a capital conservation buffer of above each of the minimum capital ratio requirements cet1 tier and total riskbased capital which must be met for a bank or bank holding company to be able to pay dividends engage in share buybacks or make discretionary bonus payments to executive management without automatic restriction the capital conservation buffer is so a banking organization needs to maintain a cet1 capital ratio of at least a total tier capital ratio of at least and a total riskbased capital ratio of at least or it would be subject to restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to its executive management the leverage capital ratio which serves as a minimum capital standard is the ratio of tier capital to quarterly average total assets less goodwill and other disallowed intangible assets the required minimum leverage ratio for all banks and bank holding companies is to be wellcapitalized the bank must maintain the following capital ratios table start cet1 riskbased capital ratio of or greater table endtable start tier riskbased capital ratio of or greater table endtable start total riskbased capital ratio of or greater and table endtable start tier leverage ratio of or greater table end the federal reserve has not yet revised the wellcapitalized standard for bank holding companies to reflect the higher capital requirements imposed under the current capital rules for purposes of the federal reserves regulation y including determining whether a bank holding company meets the requirements to be a financial holding company bank holding companies such as the company must maintain a tier riskbased capital ratio of or greater and a total riskbased capital ratio of or greater to be wellcapitalized if the federal reserve were to apply the same or a very similar wellcapitalized standard to bank holding companies as that applicable to the bank the companys capital ratios as of december would exceed such revised wellcapitalized standard the federal reserve may require bank holding companies including the company to maintain capital ratios substantially in excess of mandated minimum levels depending upon general economic conditions and a bank holding companys particular condition risk profile and growth plans failure to be wellcapitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could have an adverse material effect on our operations or financial condition for example only a wellcapitalized depository institution may accept brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval failure to be wellcapitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could also result in restrictions on the companys or the banks ability to pay dividends or otherwise distribute capital or to receive regulatory approval of applications or other restrictions on its growth as of december the companys and the banks regulatory capital ratios were above the wellcapitalized standards and met the fully phasedin capital conservation buffer please

holding companies and banks to phasein the dayone retained earnings impact of the new cecl accounting rule over a period of three years for regulatory capital purposes in response to the covid19 pandemic the federal banking agencies issued another final rule for additional transitional relief to regulatory capital related to the impact of the adoption of cecl the final rule provides banking organizations that adopt cecl in the calendar year with the option to delay for two years the estimated impact of cecl on regulatory capital followed by the aforementioned threeyear transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of benefit during the initial twoyear delay for a total fiveyear transition the estimated impact of cecl on regulatory capital modified cecl transitional amount is calculated as the sum of the dayone impact on retained earnings upon adoption of cecl cecl transitional amount and the calculated change in the acl relative to the dayone acl upon adoption of cecl multiplied by a scaling factor of the scaling factor is used to approximate the difference in the acl under cecl relative to the incurred loss methodology the modified cecl transitional amount will be calculated each quarter for the first two years of the fiveyear transition the amount of the modified cecl transition amount will be fixed as of december and that amount will be subject to the threeyear phase out the company chose the fiveyear transition method and is deferring the recognition of the effects from day one and the cecl difference for the first two years of application safety and soundness guidelines the federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines prescribing safety and soundness standards relating to internal controls risk management information systems internal audit systems loan documentation credit underwriting interest rate exposure asset growth and compensation fees and benefits these guidelines in general require appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage specified risks and exposures the guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and characterize compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer or employee director or principal shareholder in addition the agencies have adopted regulations that authorize but do not require an agency to order an institution that has been given notice by the agency that it is not in compliance with any of the safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan if after being so notified an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types including those that may limit growth or capital distributions lending standards and guidance the federal banking agencies have adopted uniform regulations prescribing standards for extensions of credit that are secured by liens or interests in real estate or made for the purpose of financing permanent improvements to real estate under these regulations all insured depository institutions such as the bank must adopt and maintain written policies establishing appropriate limits and standards for extensions of credit that are secured by liens or interests in real estate or are made for the purpose of financing permanent improvements to real estate these policies must establish loan portfolio diversification standards prudent underwriting standards including loantovalue limits that are clear and measurable loan administration procedures and documentation approval and reporting requirements the real estate lending policies must reflect consideration of the federal bank regulators interagency guidelines for real estate lending policies the federal banking agencies have also jointly issued guidance on concentrations in commercial real estate lending the guidance which defines commercial real estate loans as exposures secured by raw land land development and construction including family residential construction multifamily property and nonfarm nonresidential property where the primary or a significant source of repayment is derived from rental income associated with the property that is loans for which or more of the source of repayment comes from third party nonaffiliated rental income or the proceeds of the sale refinancing or permanent financing of the property the guidance requires that appropriate processes be in place to identify monitor and control risks associated with real estate lending concentrations if a concentration is present management must employ heightened risk management practices that address key elements including board and management oversight and strategic planning portfolio management development of underwriting standards risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing and maintenance of increased capital levels as needed to support the level of commercial real estate lending the required heightened risk management practices could include enhanced strategic planning underwriting policies risk management internal controls portfolio stress testing and risk exposure limits as well as appropriately designed compensation and incentive programs higher allowances for loan losses and capital levels may also be required the guidance states that the following metrics may indicate a concentration of commercial real estate loans but that these metrics are neither limits nor a safe harbor total reported loans for construction land development and other land represent or more of total riskbased capital or total reported loans secured by multifamily properties nonfarm nonresidential properties excluding those that are owneroccupied and loans for construction land development and other land represent or more of total riskbased capital and the banks commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased or more during the pr ior months as of december our total reported loans for construction land development and other land were of the banks total risk based capital and our total reported loans secured by multifamily and nonfarm nonresidential properties and loans for construction land development and other land were of the banks total risk based capital consumer protection laws the bank is subject to a number of federal laws designed to protect its customers these consumer protection laws apply to a broad range of our activities and to various aspects of our business and include laws relating to interest rates fair lending disclosures of credit terms and estimated transaction costs to consumer borrowers debt collection practices the use of and the provision of information to consumer reporting agencies and the prohibition of unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offer sale or provision of consumer financial products and services administration of many of these consumer protection rules are the responsibility of the cfpb which has exclusive supervisory authority over insured depository institutions with more than billion in total assets and any affiliates thereof the cfpb also has authority to define and prevent unfair deceptive and abusive practices in the consumer financial area and expanded data collecting powers for purposes of determining bank compliance with the fair lending laws the cfpb has promulgated many mortgagerelated final rules including rules related to the ability to repay and qualified mortgage standards mortgage servicing standards loan originator compensation standards highcost mortgage requirements home mortgage disclosure act requirements and appraisal and escrow standards for higher priced mortgages in addition several proposed revisions to mortgagerelated rules are pending finalization the mortgagerelated final rules issued by the cfpb have materially restructured the origination servicing and securitization of residential mortgages in the united states these rules have impacted and will continue to impact the business practices of mortgage lenders including the company for example under the cfpbs ability to repay and qualified mortgage rule before making a mortgage loan a lender must establish that a borrower has the ability to repay the mortgage qualified mortgages as defined in the rule are presumed to comply with this requirement and as a result present less litigation risk to lenders for a loan to qualify as a qualified mortgage the loan must satisfy certain limits on terms and conditions pricing and a maximum debttoincome ratio loans eligible for purchase guarantee or insurance by a government agency or governmentsponsored enterprise are exempt from some of these requirements satisfying the qualified mortgage standards ensuring correct calculations are made for individual loans recordkeeping and monitoring as well as understanding the effect of the qualified mortgage standards on cra obligations impose significant new compliance obligations on and involve compliance costs for mortgage lenders including the company under the durbin amendment and the federal reserves implementing regulations the bank as a debit card issuer may receive a maximum permissible interchange fee equal to no more than plus bps of the transaction value for many types of debit interchange transactions further a debit card issuer may also recover per transaction for fraud prevention purposes if the issuer complies with certain fraudrelated requirements required by the federal reserve in addition the federal reserve rules governing routing and exclusivity require debit card issuers to offer two unaffiliated networks for routing transactions on each debit or prepaid product community reinvestment act the cra requires the appropriate federal banking agency in connection with its examination of a bank to assess the banks record in meeting the credit needs of the communities served by the institution including low and moderate income neighborhoods furthermore the relevant federal bank regulatory agency is required to consider a banks cra assessment when considering the banks application to among other things merge or consolidate with or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of an insured depository institution or open or relocate a branch office the relevant federal banking agency the occ in the banks case examines each bank and assigns it a public cra rating under the cra institutions are assigned a rating of outstanding satisfactory needs to improve or unsatisfactory the bank received an outstanding rating at its most recent cra evaluation on may the occ adopted a final rule to amend the occs regulations under the cra the final rule which applies to national banks like the bank is designed to reflect changes in the banking industry while encouraging these institutions to meet the credit needs of local communities the final rule makes significant and fundamental changes to many aspects of the occs cra regulations changes made by the occ include clarifying the importance of the quantity and quality of activities table start increasing credit for mortgage origination of affordable housing in low and moderateincome areas and table endtable start clarifying credit for athletic facilities to ensure they benefit and support low and moderateincome communities table end importantly the occs final rule includes a general framework for assessing cra performance but does not set forth the specific metrics that a bank must meet in order to obtain a particular cra rating a notice of proposed rulemaking was issued in november requesting comment on the occs proposed approach to determine the cra evaluation measure benchmarks retail lending distribution test thresholds and community development minimums under the general performance standards the proposal further explains how the occ would assess significant declines in cra activities levels in connection with performance context following the initial establishment of benchmarks thresholds and minimums following additional data collection and analysis the occ will set the benchmarks minimums and thresholds for the final rule the occs final rule is subject to a transition period for compliance based on a banks size and business model banks such as the bank will have until january to comply with the new requirements the fdic and the federal reserve declined to join the final rule and it is possible that each regulator will have its own cra framework leading to further changes in the banks processes for cra compliance in the past the federal banking agencies have aligned their cra regulations antimoney laundering rules the bank secrecy act the usa patriot act of and other laws and regulations require financial institutions among other duties to institute and maintain an effective antimoney laundering aml program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports when appropriate among other things these laws and regulations require the bank to take steps to prevent the use of the bank to facilitate the flow of illegal or illicit money to report large currency transactions and to file suspicious activity reports the bank also is required to develop and implement a comprehensive aml compliance program banks must also have in place appropriate know your customer policies and procedures the antimoney laundering act of enacted on january as part of the national defense authorization act does not directly impose new requirements on banks but requires the us treasury department to issue national antimoney laundering and countering the financing of terrorism priorities and conduct studies and issue regulations that may over the next few years significantly alter some of the due diligence recordkeeping and reporting requirements that the bank secrecy act and usa patriot act impose on banks the antimoney laundering act of also contains provisions that promote increased informationsharing and use of technology and increases penalties for violations of the bank secrecy act and includes whistleblower incentives both of which could increase the prospect of regulatory enforcement violations of these requirements can result in substantial civil and criminal sanctions and the federal banking agencies are required to consider the effectiveness of a financial institutions aml activities when reviewing bank mergers and bank holding company acquisitions in addition to other bank regulatory agencies the federal financial crimes enforcement network of the department of the treasury is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the state and federal banking regulators as well as the us department of justice cfpb drug enforcement administration and internal revenue service ofac regulation the office of foreign assets control or ofac is responsible for administering economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries nationals and others as defined by various executive orders and in various legislation ofacadministered sanctions take many different forms for example sanctions may include restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on us persons engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in or providing investmentrelated advice or assistance to a sanctioned country and a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest by prohibiting transfers of property subject to us jurisdiction including property in the possession or control of us persons ofac also publishes lists of persons organizations and countries suspected of aiding harboring or engaging in terrorist acts known as specially designated nationals and blocked persons blocked assets for example property and bank deposits cannot be paid out withdrawn set off or transferred in any manner without a license from ofac if we find a name on any transaction account or wire transfer that is on an ofac list we must freeze or block such account or transaction file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences data privacy federal and state law contains extensive consumer privacy protection provisions the grammleachbliley act of as amended requires financial institutions to periodically disclose their privacy policies and practices relating to sharing such information and enables retail customers to opt out of our ability to share information with unaffiliated third parties under certain circumstances other federal and state laws and regulations impact our ability to share certain information with affiliates and nonaffiliates for marketing andor nonmarketing purposes or to contact customers with marketing offers the grammleachbliley act also requires financial institutions to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative technical and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information these security and privacy policies and procedures for the protection of personal and confidential information are in effect across all businesses and geographic locations federal law also makes it a criminal offense except in limited circumstances to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means data privacy and data protection are areas of increasing state legislative focus for example in june of the governor of california signed into law the california consumer privacy act of ccpa the ccpa which became effective on january applies to forprofit businesses that conduct business in california and meet certain revenue or data collection thresholds the ccpa will give consumers the right to request disclosure of information collected about them and whether that information has been sold or shared with others the right to request deletion of personal information subject to certain exceptions the right to opt out of the sale of the consumers personal information and the right not to be discriminated against for exercising these rights the ccpa contains several exemptions including that many but not all requirements of the ccpa are inapplicable to information that is collected processed sold or disclosed pursuant to the grammleachbliley act the california state legislature has amended the act since its passage which the governor has signed into law and regulations reading ccpa went into effect on august modifications to the regulations are being considered and evaluated by california attorney general and the california department of justice california voters also recently passed the california privacy rights act which will take effect on january and significantly modifies the ccpa including by imposing additional obligations on covered companies and expanding california consumers rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information potentially resulting in further uncertainty and additional costs and expenses because our correspondent division has an office in california we are in the process of changing our data collection and retrieval processes to comply with the ccpa in addition similar laws may be adopted by other states where we do business the federal government may also pass data privacy or data protection legislation like other lenders the bank uses credit bureau data in their underwriting activities use of such data is regulated under the fair credit reporting act which also regulates reporting information to credit bureaus prescreening individuals for credit offers sharing of information between affiliates and using affiliate data for marketing purposes similar state laws may impose additional requirements on us and our subsidiaries future legislation and regulation banking statutes regulations and policies are continually under review by congress state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies in addition to laws and regulations state and federal bank regulatory agencies may issue policy statements interpretive letters and similar written guidance applicable to us and our subsidiaries we cannot predict the substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulation or the application of those laws or regulations although enactment of any significant proposal could affect how we operate and could significantly increase
