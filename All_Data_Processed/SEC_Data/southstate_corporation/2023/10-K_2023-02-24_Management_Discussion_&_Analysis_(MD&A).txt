corporation and its subsidiarys results of operations for the year ended december as compared to the year ended december and the year ended december as compared to the year ended december and also analyzes our financial condition as of december as compared to december like most banking institutions we derive most of our income from interest we receive on our loans and investments our primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is our deposits on most of which we pay interest consequently one of the key measures of our success is the amount of net interest income or the difference between the income on our interestearning assets such as loans and investments and the expense on our interest bearing liabilities such as deposits another key measure is the spread between the yield we earn on these interestearning assets and the rate we pay on our interestbearing liabilities there are risks inherent in all loans so we maintain an allowance for credit losses to absorb our estimate of probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible we establish and maintain this allowance by recording a provision or recovery for credit losses against our earnings in the following section we have included a detailed discussion of this process in addition to earning interest on our loans and investments we earn income through fees and other services we charge to our customers we incur costs in addition to interest expense on deposits and other borrowings the largest of which is salaries and employee benefits we describe the various components of this noninterest income and noninterest expense in the following discussion the following section also identifies significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during

in net income available to the common shareholders was up million or in compared to for further discussion of the companys results of operations for the year ended december as compared to the year ended december and the year ended december as compared to the year ended december see results of operations section of this mda starting on page at december we had total assets of approximately billion compared to approximately billion at december see the financial condition section of this mda starting on page for a more detailed description of the change in our balance sheet our asset quality results remained strong in december net charge offs as a percentage of average loans increased slightly to compared to for the year ended december the total nonperforming assets npas increased million to million at december from million at december acquired npas increased million to million at december from million at december acquired nonperforming loans increased million and acquired oreo and other nonperforming assets decreased million nonacquired npas increased million to million at december from million at december which was related to an increase in nonacquired nonperforming loans of million nonacquired oreo and other npas declined by to as of december compared to as of december the total npas as a percentage of total assets increased basis points to at december as compared to at december our efficiency ratio was at december compared to at december the improvement in our efficiency ratio was due to both the effects of a decrease in noninterest expense and the increase in the total of taxequivalent te net interest income and noninterest income the companys net interest income has increased significantly in with the current rising rate environment we continue to remain wellcapitalized with a total riskbased capital ratio of and a tier leverage ratio of as of december compared to and respectively at december the total riskbased capital ratio decreased due to the additional riskweighted assets acquired through the acquisition of atlantic capital in the first quarter of which on average had a higher risk weighting the reduction in cash and cash equivalents during the year which are lower risk weighted assets and due to the organic growth in loans during which have a higher risk weighting the effects on our ratios from the increase in riskweighted assets were partially offset by an increase in total riskbased capital due to net income recognized in the addition to the net equity of million issued for the atlantic capital acquisition and the million in subordinated debentures assumed from atlantic capital that qualify as tier riskbased capital these increases in capital were partially offset by the million of stock repurchases completed during including shares withheld for taxes pertaining to the vesting of equity awards along with the dividend paid to shareholders of million and the redemption of million of subordinated debentures on june the tier leverage ratios for both the company and bank increased compared to december as the percentage increase in tier capital was greater than the percentage increase in average assets during due mainly to net income and equity issued in the atlantic capital acquisition we believe our current capital ratios position us well to grow both organically and through certain strategic opportunities for further discussion of the companys financial condition as of december compared to december see financial condition section of this mda starting on page recent events atlantic capital bancshares inc merger on march the company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of atlantic capital in a stock transaction upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein atlantic capital merged with and into the company with the company continuing as the surviving corporation in the merger immediately following the merger atlantic capitals wholly owned banking subsidiary atlantic capital bank na acb merged with and into the bank the surviving bank in the bank merger shareholders of atlantic capital received  of the companys common stock for each share of atlantic capital common stock they owned in total the purchase price for atlantic capital was million in the acquisition the company acquired billion of loans including paycheck protection program ppp loans at fair value net of million or estimated discount to the outstanding principal balance representing of the companys total loans at december of the total loans acquired management identified million that had more than insignificantly deteriorated since origination and were thus determined to be pcd loans additional details regarding the atlantic capital merger are discussed in note mergers and acquisitions branch consolidation and other cost initiatives as a part of the ongoing evaluation of customer service delivery and efficiencies the company consolidated branch locations in the third and fourth quarters of the annual savings in of these closures which primarily includes personnel facilities and equipment cost is expected to be million and the impact in was approximately million these consolidated locations were in florida south carolina georgia north carolina and virginia capital management on june the company received federal reserve boards supervisory nonobjection on the stock repurchase program which was previously approved by the board of directors of the company in april contingent upon receipt of such supervisory nonobjection the aggregate number of shares of common stock the company is authorized to repurchase totaled million shares which includes  remaining from the companys stock repurchase plan during the company did not repurchase any shares pursuant to the stock repurchase program during the first quarter of before the approval of the stock repurchase program the company repurchased a total of  at a weighted average price of per share pursuant to the stock repurchase plan critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap and follow general practices within the banking industry our financial position and results of operations are affected by managements application of accounting policies including estimates assumptions and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and expenses differences in the application of these policies could result in material changes in our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations and related disclosures understanding our accounting policies is fundamental to understanding our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations accordingly our significant accounting policies and changes in accounting principles and effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in note of our audited consolidated financial statements the following is a summary of our critical accounting policies that are highly dependent on estimates assumptions and judgments business combinations we account for acquisitions under fasb asc topic business combinations which requires the use of the acquisition method of accounting all identifiable assets acquired including loans and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value we adopted asu financial instruments credit losses topic measurement of credit losses on financial instruments on january which now requires us to record purchased financial assets with credit deterioration pcd assets defined as a morethaninsignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination or issuance at the purchase price plus the allowance for credit losses expected at the time of acquisition under this method there is no provision for credit losses affecting net income on acquisition of pcd assets changes in estimates of expected credit losses after acquisition are recognized as provision for credit loss expense or recovery of credit losses in subsequent periods as they arise any noncredit discount or premium resulting from acquiring a pool of purchased financial assets with credit deterioration shall be allocated to each individual asset at the acquisition date the initial allowance for credit losses determined on a collective basis shall be allocated to individual assets to appropriately allocate any noncredit discount or premium the noncredit discount or premium after the adjustment for the allowance for credit losses shall be accreted into interest income using the interest method based on the effective interest rate determined after the adjustment for credit losses at the adoption date a purchased financial asset that does not qualify as a pcd asset is accounted for similar to an originated financial asset generally this means that an entity recognizes the allowance for credit losses for nonpcd assets through net income at the time of acquisition in addition both the credit discount and noncredit discount or premium resulting from acquiring a pool of purchased financial assets that do not qualify as pcd assets shall be allocated to each individual asset this combined discount or premium shall be accreted into interest income using the effective yield method for further discussion of our loan accounting and acquisitions see note 1summary of significant accounting policies note 2mergers and acquisitions note 4loans and note 5allowance for credit losses to the audited condensed consolidated financial statements allowance for credit losses or acl the acl reflects managements estimate of expected credit losses that will result from the inability of our borrowers to make required loan payments management used the systematic methodology to determine its acl for loans held for investment and certain offbalancesheet credit exposures management considers the effects of past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts on the collectability of the loan portfolio the companys estimate of its acl involves a high degree of judgment therefore managements process for determining expected credit losses may result in a range of expected credit losses it is possible that others given the same information may at any point in time reach a different reasonable conclusion the companys acl recorded on the balance sheet reflects managements best estimate within the range of expected credit losses the company recognizes in net income the amount needed to adjust the acl for managements current estimate of expected credit losses see note summary of significant accounting policies for further detailed descriptions of our estimation process and methodology related to the acl see also note 5allowance for credit losses and provision for credit losses in this mda other real estate owned and bank property held for sale other real estate owned oreo consists of properties obtained through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu of foreclosure in satisfaction of loans both oreo and bank property held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value and the fair value was determined on the basis of current valuations obtained principally from independent sources adjusted for estimated selling costs at the time of foreclosure or initial possession of collateral for oreo any excess of the loan balance over the fair value of the real estate held as collateral is treated as a charge against the acl at the time a bank property is no longer in service and is moved to held for sale any excess of the current book value over fair value is recorded as noninterest expense in the consolidated statements of income subsequent adjustments to this value are described below in the following paragraph we report subsequent declines in the fair value of oreo and bank properties held for sale below the new cost basis through valuation adjustments significant judgment and complex estimates are required in estimating the fair value of these properties and the period of time within which such estimates can be considered current is significantly shortened during periods of market volatility in response to market conditions and other economic factors management may utilize liquidation sales as part of its problem asset disposition strategy as a result of the significant judgments required in estimating fair value and the variables involved in different methods of disposition the net proceeds realized from sales transactions could differ significantly from the current valuations used to determine the fair value of these properties management reviews the value of these properties periodically and adjusts the values as appropriate revenue and expenses from oreo operations as well as gains or losses on sales and any subsequent adjustments to the value are recorded as oreo expense in the consolidated statements of income gains or losses on sale of bank properties held for sale and generally any subsequent writedowns to the value are recorded as a component in other expense in the consolidated statements of income goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the sum of the estimated fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less the estimated fair value of the liabilities assumed in a business combination as of december and the balance of goodwill was billion and billion respectively goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the assets fair value in january the fasb issued asu no which simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment for all entities by requiring impairment charges to be based on step of the previous accounting guidances twostep impairment test under asc topic under the new guidance if a reporting units carrying amount exceeds its fair value an entity will record an impairment charge based on that difference the impairment charge will be limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit the new standard eliminates the requirement to calculate a goodwill impairment charge using step which involved calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which the first step indicated impairment the standard does not change the guidance on completing step of the goodwill impairment test an entity will still be able to perform todays optional qualitative goodwill impairment assessment before proceeding to the quantitative step of determining whether the reporting units carrying amount exceeds it fair value we evaluated the carrying value of goodwill as of october our annual test date and determined that no impairment charge was necessary our stock price has historically traded above its book value on december our stock price closed at which is above the book value of and tangible book value of the lowest trading price for our stock during was which was above yearend book value and tangible book value based upon our internal valuation and analysis as of october we determined that no impairment charge was necessary at this time we will continue to monitor the impact of current economic conditions and other events on the companys business operating results cash flows and financial condition if the current economic conditions and other events were to deteriorate and our stock price falls below current levels we will have to reevaluate the impact on our financial condition and potential impairment of goodwill core deposit intangibles and client list intangibles consist primarily of amortizing assets established during the acquisition of other banks this includes whole bank acquisitions and the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities from other financial institutions core deposit intangibles represent the estimated value of longterm deposit relationships acquired in these transactions client list intangibles represent the value of longterm client relationships for the correspondent banking and wealth and trust management business these costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives such as deposit accounts in the case of core deposit intangible on a method that we believe reasonably approximates the anticipated benefit stream from this intangible the estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed for reasonableness income taxes and deferred tax assets income taxes are provided for the tax effects of the transactions reported in our consolidated financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related to differences between the tax basis and accounting basis of certain assets and liabilities including loans available for sale securities acl write downs of oreo properties and bank properties held for sale accumulated depreciation net operating loss carry forwards accretion income deferred compensation intangible assets mortgage servicing rights and postretirement benefits the deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled a valuation allowance is recorded in situations where it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset is not realizable as changes in tax laws or rates are enacted deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes the company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return additionally income tax returns are filed by the company or its subsidiaries in the states of alabama arkansas arizona california colorado florida georgia illinois indiana minnesota mississippi missouri new jersey new york north carolina south carolina tennessee texas and virginia and city of new york city we evaluate the need for income tax reserves related to uncertain income tax positions but had no material reserves at december or recent accounting standards and pronouncements for information relating to recent accounting standards and pronouncements see note to our audited consolidated financial statements entitled summary of significant accounting policies results of operations consolidated net income available to common shareholders increased by million for the year ended december compared to the year ended december this increase reflects an increase in interest income and a decrease in noninterest expense partially offsetting these positive effects on net income was an increase in provision for credit losses a decrease in noninterest income an increase in interest expense and an increase in the provision for income taxes below are key highlights of our results of operations during table start consolidated net income available to common shareholders increased to million in compared to million in and increased million or compared to million in table end table start o increased interest income of million resulting from a million increase in interest income from loans and loans held for sale a million increase in interest income from investment securities and a million increase in interest income on federal funds sold securities purchased under agreement to resell and interestbearing deposits these increases were mainly due to the increase in yields in all categories of interestearning assets in the current rising rate environment as the federal reserve bank has table end table start raised it federal funds rate basis points in the increase in interest income is also due to the increase in the average balance of both loans through organic loan growth and loans acquired through the atlantic capital acquisition and investment securities from the retained portion of the investment securities acquired from atlantic capital on march along with the strategic decision to increase the investment securities portfolio in table end table start o increased interest expense of million which resulted from a million increase in interest expense from deposits a million increase in interest expense in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase a million increase in interest expense from corporate and subordinated debentures and other borrowings these increases were primarily due to an increase in average costs in the current rising rate environment along with a billion increase in the average balance of interestbearing deposits primarily due to the interestbearing deposits of billion assumed from the atlantic capital acquisition on march table endtable start o decreased noninterest income of million which resulted primarily from a million decline in mortgage banking income a million decrease in correspondent banking and capital markets income and a million decrease in other noninterest income these decreases were offset by a million increase in service charges on deposit accounts a million increase in debit prepaid atm and merchant card related income a million increase in bank owned life insurance boli income a million increase in sba income and a million increase in trust and investment services income see noninterest income section on page for further discussion table endtable start o decreased noninterest expense of million which resulted primarily from a million decrease in merger and branch consolidation related expense extinguishment of debt cost of million pertaining to the redemption of million in trust preferred securities completed during the second quarter of and a million decrease in occupancy expense these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in other noninterest expense a million increase in information services expense a million increase in fdic assessment and other regulatory charges a million increase in professional fees a million increase in business development and staff related expense and a million increase in salaries and employee benefits expense see noninterest expense section on page for further discussion table endtable start o a million increase in the provision for allowance for credit losses as the company recorded provision for credit losses of million in while recording a release of the allowance for credit losses of million in and table endtable start o higher income tax provision of million primarily due to the change in pretax book income between the two years the company recorded pretax book income of million in compared to pretax book income of million in the companys effective tax rate was for the year ended december compared to for the year ended december table endtable start basic earnings per common share decreased to in from in and increased from in table endtable start diluted earnings per common share decreased to in from in and increased from in table end table start return on average assets was in a decrease compared to in and an increase compared to in the decrease in compared to was driven by the increase in total average assets of or billion to billion in being greater than the increase in net income of or million to million the increase in average assets was mainly due to both increases in loans and investment securities through both the atlantic capital acquisition and organic growth the increase in compared to was driven by the growth in net income of or million to million being greater than the increase in total average assets of or billion to billion in mainly related to the full year impact in from the merger with centerstate completed during the second quarter of along with the change in the provision for credit losses as the company had a release of provision of million in compared to provision of million in table endtable start return on average common shareholders equity decreased to in compared to in and an increase from in the decrease in compared to was driven by the higher growth in average common shareholders equity of or million compared to the growth in net income table end table start of or million to million the increase in compared to was driven by the greater growth in net income of or million to million compared to an increase in average common shareholders equity of or billion in as mentioned above the increase in net income in was mainly due to a full years impact from the merger with centerstate along with the reversals of provision for credit losses in resulting from improved economic forecasts related to the covid19 pandemic table end table start our dividend payout ratio was for compared with in and in the increase in the dividend payout ratio in compared to was due to the increase in total dividends paid during of or million being greater than the increase in net income available to common shareholders which increased the decrease in the dividend payout ratio in compared to was due to the growth in net income available to common shareholders which increased being greater than the increase in dividends paid of or million table end net interest income net interest income is the largest component of our net income net interest income is the difference between income earned on interest earning assets and interest paid on deposits and borrowings net interest income is determined by the yields earned on interestearning assets rates paid on interestbearing liabilities the relative balances of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities the degree of mismatch and the maturity and repricing characteristics of interestearning assets and interest bearing liabilities net interest income divided by average interestearning assets represents our net interest margin in march of the federal reserve dropped the federal funds target rate basis points to a range of to in reaction to the covid19 pandemic during the federal reserve raised interest rates one time by basis points two times by basis points and four times by basis points from a range of to to a range of to as a result the company operated under an increasing rate environment for the majority of compared to net interest income and net interest margin are highlighted for the year ended december compared to table start both the nontax equivalent and the tax equivalent net interest margin increased by basis points in compared to while the yield on interestearning assets increased basis points the cost of interestbearing liabilities marginally increased basis points the increase in the net interest margin was primarily due to the rising rate environment in effect during as our interestearning assets have repriced more quickly than our interestbearing liabilities the increase was also due to a change in asset mix as the lower yielding interestbearing deposit and federal funds sold declined in while our higher yielding loan portfolio and investments increased table endtable start o overall our yield on interestearning assets in increased basis points from primarily due to higher yields on all interestearning assets as the federal reserve bank raised interest rates basis points starting late in first quarter of the increases in interest rates in combination with the increase in the average balance of the higher yielding loan portfolio of billion and the investment portfolio of billion along with the decline in the average balance of lower yielding interestearning deposits and federal funds sold of billion affected the overall yield increase between the comparable periods table endtable start o the average cost of interestbearing liabilities in compared to increased basis points this increase was driven by the effects from the rising rate environment on the repricing of variable rate products including interestbearing and savings deposits federal funds purchased and trust preferred corporate debt the cost of interestbearing and savings deposits increased basis points while the cost of federal funds purchased increased basis points and the cost of corporate and subordinated debentures increased basis points overall interestbearing deposits have been slower to reprice in the rising rate environment table end table start our net interest income increased by million or to billion during compared to as interest income increased million and interest expense only increased million table end table start o our interest income increased by million due to table endtable start higher nonacquired loan interest income of million due to a higher average balance of billion higher investment securities interest income of million because of a higher average balance of billion and higher federal funds sold and repurchase agreements interest income of million due to the rising rate environment in effect during the current year even though the average balance was lower by billion table endtable start these increases in interest income were partially offset by lower interest income on acquired loans of million due to a lower average balance of billion resulting from paydowns payoffs and renewals of acquired loans that are moved to our nonacquired loan portfolio interest income on loans held for sale also declined by million due to a lower average balance of million table end table start o our interest expense increased by of million in compared to due to table endtable start interest expense on interestbearing deposits increasing million because of a slight increase in the average cost of basis point along with a billion increase in the average balance interest expense on federal funds purchased increasing million because of an increase in the average cost of basis points and interest expense related to other borrowings increasing million because of an increase in the average cost of basis points table end table start average interestearning assets increased billion or to billion in compared to table endtable start o the increase in the average balance on nonacquired loan portfolio of billion was due to organic growth and renewals of matured acquired loans that are moved to our nonacquired loan portfolio table endtable start o the decrease in the average balance on the acquired loan portfolio of billion was due to paydowns payoffs and renewals of acquired loans that are moved to our nonacquired loan portfolio table endtable start o the increase in the average balance in investment securities of billion was a result of the bank using a portion of the excess funds to increase the size of its investment securities along with the banks strategy on replacing lower yielding securities with higher yielding securities as interest rates started to increase in the first quarter of in addition to retaining a portion of the investment securities acquired from atlantic capital on march the excess liquidity was from the growth in deposits in and during the first half of table end table start average interestbearing liabilities increased billion or to billion in compared to table endtable start o the average balance of interestbearing deposits increased billion primarily due to the interestbearing deposits of billion assumed from the atlantic capital acquisition on march the average balance of lower costing interestbearing transaction accounts money market accounts and savings accounts increased billion while the average balance of higher costing time deposits declined million in compared to table endtable start o the average balance of federal funds purchased decreased million and repurchase agreements decreased table endtable start o the average balance of other borrowings increased by million due to million of subordinated debentures assumed from atlantic capital on march partially offset by the redemption of million of subordinated debentures in late june table end compared to net interest income and net interest margin highlighted for the year ended december compared to table start our net interest income increased by million or to billion during compared to as interest income increased million and interest expense declined million table endtable start o our interest income increased by million due to table endtable start higher nonacquired loan interest income of million due to a higher average balance of billion higher investment securities interest income of million because of higher average balances of billion acquired loan interest income increasing by million because of higher table end table start average balances in acquired loans of billion and higher federal funds sold and repurchase agreements interest income of million because of higher average balances of billion table endtable start these increases in interest income were partially offset by lower interest income of million on loans held for sale due to lower average balances of million table endtable start the effects from the increases in the average balance of interestearning assets have outweighed the effects of the declines in average yields in table end table start o average interestearning assets increased billion or to billion in compared to the increase in the average balance on the nonacquired loan portfolio of billion was due to organic growth and renewals of acquired loans that are moved to our nonacquired loan portfolio the increase in the average balance on the acquired loan portfolio of billion was due to the loans acquired from the merger with centerstate which were outstanding for days in although the acquired loan portfolio increased from it has declined throughout due to paydowns payoffs and renewals of acquired loans that are moved to our nonacquired loan portfolio the increase in the average balance of investment securities of billion was a result of the companys decision to strategically increase the investment portfolio due to the excess liquidity from deposit growth table endtable start o overall our yield on interestearning assets in declined basis points from due to the falling interest rate environment resulting from the drops in the federal funds rate made by the federal reserve in march the yield on the nonacquired loan portfolio decreased basis points the acquired loan portfolio yield declined basis points the yield on investment securities dropped by basis points and on the yield on federal funds sold securities purchased under agreements to resell and interestbearing deposits decreased by basis points the yield on loans held for sale remained flat the yield on interestearning assets also declined as the average balance of lower yielding federal funds sold securities purchased under agreements to resell interestbearing deposits and investment securities increased as a percentage of total interestearning assets from to table endtable start o our interest expense declined by of million in compared to due to table endtable start interest expense on interestbearing deposits declining million because of a reduction in the average cost of basis points interest expense related to other borrowings declined million because of a lower average balance of million and the interest expense on repurchase agreements declined because of a decrease in the average cost of basis points table endtable start the effects from the declines in average cost of interestbearing liabilities have outweighed the effects of the increases in average balance in table end table start o average interestbearing liabilities increased billion or to billion in compared to mainly due the interestbearing liabilities assumed from centerstate which were outstanding for days in the average balance of interestbearing deposits increased billion the average balance of federal funds purchased increased million and repurchase agreements increased million the average balance on other borrowing decreased million within other borrowings the average balance on corporate and subordinated debentures increased million as the company assumed million in borrowings in the merger with centerstate the increase related to the merger was partially offset by the companys redemption of million of subordinated debentures and trust preferred securities assumed from the centerstate merger in june the average balance of fhlb and frb borrowings decreased million due to the companys strategic decision to payoff million of fhlb advances along with the termination of interest rate hedges on these borrowings in the fourth quarter of table endtable start o the average cost of interestbearing liabilities in compared to decreased basis points this decrease occurred in all categories of funding except for other borrowings which increased basis points in the primary cause for the lower cost on interestbearing deposits of basis points federal funds purchased of basis points and repurchase agreements of basis points was the continued low interest rate environment the cause for the increase in cost on other borrowings in is due to having a full years impact from the higher cost of subordinated debt assumed in the centerstate merger along with the effects of paying off the lower cost fhlb and frb borrowings along with the termination of the interest rate hedges on these borrowing in the fourth quarter of table end table start the nontax equivalent net interest margin decreased by basis points basis point decline on a tax equivalent basis in compared to due to the decline in the yield on interest earning assets of basis points which

increase in shortterm and longterm interest rates during management evaluates securities for impairment where there has been a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis of a security to determine whether there is a credit loss associated with the decline in fair value on at least a quarterly basis and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation credit losses are calculated individually rather than collectively using a discounted cash flow method whereby management compares the present value of expected cash flows with the amortized cost basis of the security the credit loss component would be recognized through the provision for credit losses consideration is given to the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer including looking at default and delinquency rates the outlook for receiving the contractual cash flows of the investments the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value or for a debt security whether it is morelikelythannot that we will be required to sell the debt security prior to recovering its fair value the anticipated outlook for changes in the general level of interest rates credit ratings thirdparty guarantees and collateral values in analyzing an issuers financial condition management considers whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred the results of reviews of the issuers financial condition and the issuers anticipated ability to pay the contractual cash flows of the investments the company performed an analysis that determined that the following securities have a zero expected credit loss us treasury securities agencybacked securities including securities issued by ginnie mae fannie mae fhlb ffcb and sba all of the us treasury and agencybacked securities have the full faith and credit backing of the united states government or one of its agencies municipal securities and all other securities that do not have a zero expected credit loss are evaluated quarterly to determine whether there is a credit loss associated with a decline in fair value all debt securities in an unrealized loss position as of december continue to perform as scheduled and we do not believe there is a credit loss or a provision for credit losses is necessary also as part of our evaluation of our intent and ability to hold investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market we consider our investment strategy cash flow needs liquidity position capital adequacy

loan portfolio offset by a billion decrease in the average balance of our acquired loan portfolio the growth in the nonacquired loan portfolio average balance was due to normal organic growth and renewals of acquired loans the decline in the acquired loan portfolio was due to paydowns and payoffs in both the pcd and nonpcd loan categories along with renewals of acquired loans that were moved to our nonacquired loan portfolio even with the billion in loans acquired through the merger with atlantic capital on march the effects on interest income from the overall increases in average

prepayments but is precluded from considering expected extensions renewals or modifications unless the company reasonably expects it will execute a tdr with a borrower in the event of a reasonablyexpected tdr the company factors the reasonablyexpected tdr into the current expected credit losses estimate for consumer loans the point at which a tdr is reasonably expected is when the company approves the borrowers application for a modification ie the borrower qualifies for the tdr or when the credit administration department approves loan concessions on substandard loans for commercial loans the point at which a tdr is reasonably expected is when the company approves the loan for modification or when the credit administration department approves loan concessions on substandard loans the company uses a discounted cash flow methodology for a tdr to calculate the effect of the concession provided to the borrower within the acl a restructuring that results in only a delay in payments that is insignificant is not considered an economic concession in accordance with the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act also known as the cares act the company implemented loan modification programs in response to the covid19 pandemic in order to provide borrowers with flexibility with respect to repayment terms the companys payment relief assistance includes forbearance deferrals extension and reaging programs along with certain other modification strategies the company elected the accounting policy in the cares act to not apply tdr accounting to

acquired loans outstanding at december all potential problem loans represent loans where information about possible credit problems of the borrowers may result in the borrowers inability to comply with present repayment terms allowance for credit losses acl as stated previously the acl reflects managements estimate of losses that will result from the inability of our borrowers to make required loan payments the company established the incremental increase in the acl at adoption through equity and subsequent adjustments through a provision for credit losses charged to earnings the company records loans charged off against the acl and subsequent recoveries if any increase the acl when they are recognized management uses systematic methodologies to determine its acl for loans held for investment and certain offbalancesheet credit exposures the acl is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loan portfolio management considers the effects of past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts on the collectability of the loan portfolio the companys estimate of its acl involves a high degree of judgment therefore managements process for determining expected credit losses may result in a range of expected credit losses the companys acl recorded in the balance sheet reflects managements best estimate within the range of expected credit losses the company recognizes in net income the amount needed to adjust the acl for managements current estimate of expected credit losses the companys acl is calculated using collectively evaluated and individually evaluated loans the allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective pool basis when similar risk characteristics exist loans with similar risk characteristics are grouped into homogenous segments or pools for analysis the discounted cash flow dcf method is used for each loan in a pool and the results are aggregated at the pool level a periodic tendency to default and absolute loss given default are applied to a projective model of the loans cash flow while considering prepayment and principal curtailment effects the analysis produces expected cash flows for each instrument in the pool by pairing loanlevel term information eg maturity date payment amount interest rate etc with topdown pool assumptions eg default rates and prepayment speeds the company has identified the following portfolio segments owneroccupied commercial real estate non owneroccupied commercial real estate multifamily municipal commercial and industrial commercial construction and land development residential construction residential senior mortgage residential junior mortgage revolving mortgage and consumer and other in determining the proper level of the acl management has determined that the loss experience of the bank provides the best basis for its assessment of expected credit losses the company therefore used its own historical credit loss experience by each loan segment over an economic cycle while excluding loss experience from certain acquired institutions ie failed banks for most of the segment models for collectively evaluated loans the company incorporated two or more macroeconomic drivers using a statistical regression modeling methodology management considers forwardlooking information in estimating expected credit losses the company subscribes to a thirdparty service which provides a quarterly macroeconomic baseline outlook and alternative scenarios for the united states economy the baseline along with the evaluation of alternative scenarios is used by management to determine the best estimate within the range of expected credit losses management evaluates the appropriateness of the reasonable and supportable forecast scenarios and takes into consideration the scenarios in relation to actual economic and other data such as gross domestic product growth monetary and fiscal policy inflation supply chain issues and global events like the russianukraine conflict as well as the volatility and magnitude of changes within those scenarios quarter over quarter and consideration of conditions within the banks operating environment and geographic area additional forecast scenarios may be weighted along with the baseline forecast to arrive at the final reserve estimate while periods of relative economic stability should generally lead to stability in forecast scenarios and weightings to estimate credit losses periods of instability can likewise require management to adjust the selection of scenarios and weightings in accordance with the accounting standards for the contractual term that extends beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period the company reverts to the long term mean of historical factors within four quarters using a straightline approach the company generally uses a fourquarter forecast and a fourquarter reversion period it is widely acknowledged that the chances of recession are still high accordingly management continues to use a blended forecast scenario of the baseline and more severe scenario depending on the circumstances and economic outlook as of december management selected a baseline weighting of and decreased the more severe scenario to from using a baseline weighting of and the more severe scenario of at the end of the third quarter of the increase of the baseline weighting reflects increasing recognition of more downside risks in the economic forecast from persistent levels of inflation and rising interest rates geopolitical tension and the russian invasion of ukraine and global supply chain energy and commodity issues the more severe scenario increased in severity from the prior quarter and was viewed as less likely by management while employment figures still showed resilience and provision related to actual loan losses remains at very low levels the downward shifts in forecasted commercial real estate price index national house price index and gdp increased expected loss rates for commercial and residential real estate as well as ci loans the resulting provision was approximately million during the fourth quarter of including a provision for unfunded commitments of million during the quarter during the company recorded million in provision for credit losses including a provision of million for unfunded commitments included in its systematic methodology to determine its acl management considers the need to qualitatively adjust expected credit losses for information not already captured in the loss estimation process these qualitative adjustments either increase or decrease the quantitative model estimation ie formulaic model results each period the company considers qualitative factors that are relevant within the qualitative framework that includes the following lending policy economic conditions not captured in models volume and mix of loan portfolio past due trends concentration risk external factors and model limitations at december we included million in qualitative adjustments which was comprised of model limitations pertaining to the pcd loan portfolio acquired through the atlantic capital merger of million potential impact of rising rates on certain ci credits of million and implementation of a new reserve framework for loan policy exceptions of million of the total million in qualitative adjustments made in the fourth quarter of million was related to unfunded commitments when a loan no longer shares similar risk characteristics with its segment the asset is assessed to determine whether it should be included in another pool or should be individually evaluated the companys threshold for individually evaluated loans includes all nonaccrual loans with a net book balance in excess of million management will monitor the credit environment and make adjustments to this threshold in the future if warranted based on the threshold above consumer financial assets will generally remain in pools unless they meet the dollar threshold the expected credit losses on individually evaluated loans will be estimated based on discounted cash flow analysis unless the loan meets the criteria for use of the fair value of collateral either by virtue of an expected foreclosure or through meeting the definition of collateraldependent financial assets that have been individually evaluated can be returned to a pool for purposes of estimating the expected credit loss insofar as their credit profile improves and the repayment terms were not considered to be unique to the asset management measures expected credit losses over the contractual term of a loan when determining the contractual term the company considers expected prepayments but is precluded from considering expected extensions renewals or modifications unless the company reasonably expects it will execute a troubled debt restructuring tdr with a borrower in the event of a reasonably expected tdr the company factors the reasonablyexpected tdr into the current expected credit losses estimate for consumer loans the point at which a tdr is reasonably expected is when the company approves the borrowers application for a modification ie the borrower qualifies for the tdr or when the credit administration department approves loan concessions on substandard loans for commercial loans the point at which a tdr is reasonably expected is when the company approves the loan for modification or when the credit administration department approves loan concessions on substandard loans the company uses a discounted cash flow methodology for a tdr to calculate the effect of the concession provided to the borrower within the acl the company has not chosen to early adopt the retirement of tdr guidance which was adopted effective january a restructuring that results in only a delay in payments that is insignificant is not considered an economic concession in accordance with the cares act the company implemented loan modification programs in response to the covid19 pandemic in order to provide borrowers with flexibility with respect to repayment terms the companys payment relief assistance includes forbearance deferrals extension and reaging programs along with certain other modification strategies the company elected the accounting policy in the cares act to not apply tdr accounting to loans modified for borrowers impacted by the covid19 pandemic if the concession met the criteria as defined under the cares act for purchased creditdeteriorated otherwise referred to herein as pcd assets are defined as acquired individual financial assets or acquired groups of financial assets with similar risk characteristics that as of the date of acquisition have experienced a morethaninsignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination as determined by the companys assessment the company records acquired pcd loans by adding the expected credit losses ie allowance for credit losses to the purchase price of the financial assets rather than recording through the provision for credit losses in the income statement the expected credit loss as of the acquisition day of a pcd loan is added to the allowance for credit losses the noncredit discount or premium is the difference between the unpaid principal balance and the amortized cost basis as of the acquisition date subsequent to the acquisition date the change in the acl on pcd loans is recognized through the provision for credit losses the noncredit discount or premium is accreted or amortized respectively into interest income over the remaining life of the pcd loan on a levelyield basis in accordance with the transition requirements within the standard the companys acquired creditimpaired loans ie aci or purchased credit impaired were treated as pcd loans as a result of the merger with atlantic capital the company identified approximately million of loans as pcd and recorded an allowance for credit losses of million on acquisition date for pcd loans atlantic capital was acquired and merged with and into the bank on march requiring that a closing date acl be prepared for atlantic capital on a standalone basis and that the acquired portfolio be included in the banks first quarter acl atlantic capitals loans represented approximately of the total banks portfolio at march given the relative size and complexity of the acquired portfolio similarities of the loan characteristics and similar loss history to the existing portfolio reserve calculations were performed using the banks existing cecl model loan segmentation and forecast weighting as the first quarter end reserve the acquisition date acl totaled million consisting of a nonpcd pooled reserve of million pcd pooled reserve of million and pcd individually evaluated reserve of million it represented about of the combined banks acl reserve at march the acquisition date reserve for unfunded commitments totaled million or of the combined banks total at march the company follows its nonaccrual policy by reversing contractual interest income in the income statement when the company places a loan on nonaccrual status therefore management excludes the accrued interest receivable balance from the amortized cost basis in measuring expected credit losses on the portfolio and does not record an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable as of december and the accrued interest receivable for loans recorded in other assets were million and million respectively the company has a variety of assets that have a component that qualifies as an offbalance sheet exposure these primarily include undrawn portions of revolving lines of credit and standby letters of credit the expected losses associated with these exposures within the unfunded portion of the expected credit loss will be recorded as a liability on the balance sheet management has determined that a majority of the companys offbalancesheet credit exposures are not unconditionally cancellable management completes funding studies based on historical data to estimate the percentage of unfunded loan commitments that will ultimately be funded to calculate the reserve for unfunded commitments management applies this funding rate along with the loss factor rate determined for each pooled loan segment to unfunded loan commitments excluding unconditionally cancellable exposures and letters of credit to arrive at the reserve for unfunded loan commitments as of december and the liabilities recorded for expected credit losses on unfunded commitments were million and million respectively the current adjustment to the acl for unfunded commitments is recognized through the provision recovery for credit losses in the consolidated statements of income the company did not have an allowance for credit losses or record a provision for credit losses on investment securities or other financials asset during as of december the balance of the acl was million or of total loans the acl increased million from the balance of million recorded at september this increase during the fourth quarter of was the result of million provision for credit losses and million in net chargeoffs for the year ended december the acl increased

atlantic capital acquisition along with net chargeoffs of million in for both the three and twelve months ended december the company recorded provision for credit losses due to loan growth and current forecasts applied to our modeling to adequately capture growing economic recessionary risks as of december the balance of the acl was million or of total loans for the year ended december the acl

as of march our board of directors approved the program after considering among other things our liquidity needs and capital resources as well as the estimated current value of our net assets the aggregate number of shares of common stocks authorized to be repurchased totals million shares which includes  remaining from the companys stock repurchase plan the number of shares to be purchased and the timing of the purchases are based on a variety of factors including but not limited to the level of cash balances general business conditions regulatory requirements the market price of our common stock and the availability of alternative investment opportunities we are subject to regulations with respect to certain riskbased capital ratios these riskbased capital ratios measure the relationship of capital to a combination of balance sheet and offbalance sheet risks the values of both balance sheet and offbalance sheet items are adjusted based on the rules to reflect categorical credit risk in addition to the riskbased capital ratios the regulatory agencies have also established a leverage ratio for assessing capital adequacy the leverage ratio is equal to tier capital divided by total consolidated onbalance sheet assets minus amounts deducted from tier capital the leverage ratio does not involve assigning risk weights to assets specifically we are required to maintain the following minimum capital ratios table start a cet1 riskbased capital ratio of table endtable start a tier riskbased capital ratio of table endtable start a total riskbased capital ratio of and table endtable start a leverage ratio of table end under the current capital rules tier capital includes two components cet1 capital and additional tier capital the highest form of capital cet1 capital consists solely of common stock plus related surplus retained earnings accumulated other comprehensive income otherwise referred to as aoci and limited amounts of minority interests that are in the form of common stock additional tier capital is primarily comprised of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and tier minority interests tier capital generally includes the allowance for loan losses up to of riskweighted assets qualifying preferred stock subordinated debt trust preferred securities and qualifying tier minority interests less any deductions in tier instruments of an unconsolidated financial institution aoci is presumptively included in cet1 capital and often would operate to reduce this category of capital when the current capital rules were first implemented the bank exercised its onetime opportunity at the end of the first quarter of for covered banking organizations to opt out of much of this treatment of aoci allowing us to retain our preexisting treatment for aoci in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executives a banking organization must maintain a capital conservation buffer on top of its minimum riskbased capital requirements this buffer must consist solely of tier common equity but the buffer applies to all three riskbased measurements cet1 tier capital and total capital resulting in the following effective minimum capital plus capital conservation buffer ratios i a cet1 capital ratio of ii a tier riskbased capital ratio of and iii a total riskbased capital ratio of the bank is also subject to the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action which identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized and is based on specified thresholds for each of the three riskbased regulatory capital ratios cet1 tier capital and total capital and for the leverage ratio the federal banking agencies revised their regulatory capital rules to i address the implementation of cecl ii provide an optional threeyear phasein period for the adoption date adverse regulatory capital effects that banking organizations are expected to experience upon adopting cecl and iii require the use of cecl in stress tests beginning with the capital planning and stress testing cycle for certain banking organizations that are subject to stress testing cecl became effective for us on january and the company applied the provisions of the standard using the modified retrospective method as a cumulativeeffect adjustment to retained earnings related to the implementation of asu we recorded additional allowance for credit losses for loans of million deferred tax assets of million an additional reserve for unfunded commitments of million and an adjustment to retained earnings of million instead of recognizing the effects on regulatory capital from asu at adoption the company initially elected the option for recognizing the adoption date effects on the companys regulatory capital calculations over a threeyear phasein in in response to the covid19 pandemic the federal banking agencies issued a final rule for additional transitional relief to regulatory capital related to the impact of the adoption of cecl the final rule provides banking organizations that adopt cecl in the calendar year with the option to delay for two years the estimated impact of cecl on regulatory capital followed by the aforementioned threeyear transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of benefit during the initial twoyear delay for a total fiveyear transition the estimated impact of cecl on regulatory capital modified cecl transitional amount is calculated as the sum of the adoption date impact on retained earnings upon adoption of cecl cecl transitional amount and the calculated change in the acl relative to the adoption date acl upon adoption of cecl multiplied by a scaling factor of the scaling factor is used to approximate the difference in the acl under cecl relative to the incurred loss methodology the company chose the fiveyear transition method and is deferring the recognition of the effects from the adoption date and the cecl difference for the first two years of application the modified cecl transitional amount was calculated each quarter for the first two years of the fiveyear transition the amount of the modified cecl transition amount was fixed as of december and that amount is subject to the threeyear

and total riskbased capital ratios decreased compared to december these ratios decreased due to the additional risk weighted assets acquired through the acquisition of atlantic capital in the first quarter of which on average had a higher risk weighting the reduction in cash and cash equivalents during the year which are lower risk weighted assets and due to the organic growth in loans during which have a higher risk weighting the effects on our ratios from the increase in riskweighted assets were partially offset by an increase in tier and total riskbased capital due to net income recognized in the addition to the net equity of million issued for the atlantic capital acquisition and the million in subordinated debentures assumed from atlantic capital that qualifies as total riskbased capital these increases in capital were partially offset by the million of stock repurchases completed during including shares withheld for taxes pertaining to the vesting of equity awards along with the dividend paid to shareholders of million and the redemption of million of subordinated debentures on june the tier leverage ratios for both the company and bank increased compared to december as the percentage increase in tier capital was greater than the percentage increase in average assets during due mainly to net income and equity issued in the atlantic capital acquisition our capital ratios are currently well in excess of the minimum standards and continue to be in the well capitalized regulatory classification the company pays cash dividends to shareholders from its assets which are mainly provided by dividends from its banking subsidiary however certain restrictions exist regarding the ability of its banking subsidiary to transfer funds to the company in the form of cash dividends loans or advances the approval of the occ is required if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year exceeds the total of its net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years less any required transfers to surplus the federal banking agencies have issued policy statements which provide that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally pay dividends only out of current earnings during the bank paid dividends to southstate totaling million the bank was not required to obtain approval of the occ to pay these dividends we used these funds and excess cash to pay our dividend to shareholders of million repurchase sh ares of our common stock on the open market totaling million and redeem million in subordinated debentures the following table provides the amount of dividends and payout ratios for the years ended december table 27dividends paid to common shareholders table start year ended december  in thousands dividend payments to common shareholders dividend payout ratios table end we retain earnings to have capital sufficient to grow our loan and investment portfolios and to support certain acquisitions or other business expansion opportunities the dividend payout ratio is calculated by dividing dividends paid during the year by net income for the year liquidity liquidity refers to our ability to generate sufficient cash to meet our financial obligations which arise primarily from the withdrawal of deposits extension of credit and payment of operating expenses liquidity risk is the risk that the banks financial condition or overall safety and soundness is adversely affected by an inability or perceived inability to meet its obligations our asset liability management committee alco is charged with the responsibility of monitoring policies designed to ensure acceptable composition of our assetliability mix two critical areas of focus for alco are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management we have employed our funds in a manner to provide liquidity from both assets and liabilities sufficient to meet our cash needs asset liquidity is maintained by the maturity structure of loans investment securities and other shortterm investments management has policies and procedures governing the length of time to maturity on loans and investments normally changes in the earning asset mix are of a longerterm nature and are not used for daytoday corporate liquidity needs our liabilities provide liquidity on a daytoday basis daily liquidity needs are met from deposit levels or from our use of federal funds purchased securities sold under agreements to repurchase interestbearing deposits at other banks and other shortterm borrowings we engage in routine activities to retain deposits intended to enhance our liquidity position these routine activities include various measures such as the following table start emphasizing relationship banking to new and existing customers where borrowers are encouraged and normally expected to maintain deposit accounts with our bank table endtable start pricing deposits including certificates of deposit at rate levels that will attract and or retain balances of deposits that will enhance our banks assetliability management and net interest margin requirements and table endtable start continually working to identify and introduce new products that will attract customers or enhance our banks appeal as a primary provider of financial services table end our nonacquired loan portfolio increased by approximately billion or approximately compared to the balance at december the increase in the nonacquired loan portfolio was due to organic growth and renewals of acquired loans that are moved to our nonacquired loan portfolio the acquired loan portfolio decreased by million or from the balance at december this decrease was due to principal paydowns chargeoffs foreclosures and renewals of acquired loans moved to the nonacquired loan portfolio offset by the addition of billion in loans acquired from the atlantic capital transaction on march our investment securities portfolio increased billion or approximately compared to the balance at december the increase in investment securities from december was due to the company making the decision to increase the size of the portfolio with the excess funds from deposit growth in the first half of the increase was a result of purchases of billion along with million in investment securities acquired in the atlantic capital transaction these increases were partially offset by maturities calls sales and paydowns of investment securities totaling billion n et amortization of premiums was million in total cash and cash equivalents declined billion in to billion at december compared to billion at december this decline was due to the company using funds to fund loan growth and purchase securities in along with the decline in deposits in the second half of at december and december we had million and million of traditional outofmarket brokered deposits at december and december we had million and million respectively of reciprocal brokered deposits total deposits were billion at december an increase of billion from billion at december our deposit growth since december included an increase in demand deposit accounts of billion and an increase in savings of million partially offset by a decline in certificates of deposit of million a decrease in interestbearing transaction accounts of million and a decrease in money market accounts of million the increase in deposits was mainly due to the deposits assumed from the merger with atlantic capital in march the acquisition date deposits assumed from atlantic capital totaled billion and were approximately billion at december excluding the deposits assumed in the atlantic capital acquisition our deposits have declined billion in as the funds in the market from federal government stimulus programs have declined along with the effects from rising interest rates in the second half of resulting from increased competition and alternatives for deposits total shortterm borrowings at december were million consisting of million in federal funds purchased and million in securities sold under agreements to repurchase total longterm borrowings at december were million and consisted of trust preferred securities and subordinated debentures which includes million of subordinated debt assumed from atlantic capital on march to the extent that we employ other types of nondeposit funding sources typically to accommodate retail and correspondent customers we continue to take in shorter maturities of such funds our current approach may provide an opportunity to sustain a low funding rate or possibly lower our cost of funds but could also increase our cost of funds if interest rates rise through the operations of our bank we have made contractual commitments to extend credit in the ordinary course of our business activities these commitments are legally binding agreements to lend money to our customers at predetermined interest rates for a specified period of time we manage the credit risk on these commitments by subjecting them to normal underwriting and risk management processes we believe that we have adequate sources of liquidity to fund commitments that are drawn upon by the borrowers in addition to commitments to extend credit we also issue standby letters of credit which are assurances to third parties that they will not suffer a loss if our customer fails to meet its contractual obligation to the thirdparty although our experience indicates that many of these standby letters of credit will expire unused through our various sources of liquidity we believe that we will have the necessary resources to meet these obligations should the need arise our ongoing philosophy is to remain in a liquid position as reflected by such indicators as the composition of our earning assets typically including some level of reverse repurchase agreements federal funds sold balances at the federal reserve bank andor other shortterm investments asset quality wellcapitalized position and profitable operating results cyclical and other economic trends and conditions can disrupt our desired liquidity position at any time we expect that these conditions would generally be of a shortterm nature under such circumstances we expect our reverse repurchase agreements and federal funds sold positions or balances at the federal reserve bank if any to serve as the primary source of immediate liquidity we could draw on additional alternative immediate funding sources from lines of credit extended to us from our correspondent banks andor the fhlb at december we had a total fhlb credit facility of billion with total outstanding fhlb letters of credit consuming million leaving billion in availability on the fhlb credit facility at december we had total federal funds credit lines of million with no outstanding advances if we needed additional liquidity we would turn to shortterm borrowings as an alternative immediate funding source and would consider other appropriate actions such as promotions to increase core deposits or the use of the brokered deposit markets in addition at december we had million of credit available at the federal reserve banks discount window but had no outstanding advances as of the end of we have a million unsecured line of credit with us bank national association with no outstanding advances at december we believe that our liquidity position continues to be adequate and readily available our contingency funding plan describes several potential stages based on stressed liquidity levels liquidity key risk indicators are reported to the board of directors on a quarterly basis we maintain various wholesale sources of funding if our deposit retention efforts were to be unsuccessful we would use these alternative sources of funding under such circumstances depending on the external source of funds our interest cost would vary based on the range of interest rates charged this could increase our cost of funds impacting our net interest margin and net interest spread assetliability management and market risk sensitivity our earnings and the economic value of equity vary in relation to the behavior of interest rates and the accompanying fluctuations in market prices of certain of our financial instruments we define interest rate risk as the risk to earnings and equity arising from the behavior of interest rates these behaviors include increases and decreases in interest rates as well as continuation of the current interest rate environment our interest rate risk principally consists of reprice option basis and yield curve risk reprice risk results from differences in the maturity or repricing characteristics of asset and liability portfolios option risk arises from embedded options in the investment and loan portfolios such as investment securities calls and loan prepayment options option risk also exists since deposit customers may withdraw funds at their discretion in response to general market conditions competitive alternatives to existing accounts or other factors the exercise of such options may result in higher costs or lower revenue basis risk refers to the potential for changes in the underlying relationship between market rates or indices which subsequently result in narrowing spreads on interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities basis risk also exists in administered rate liabilities such as interestbearing checking accounts savings accounts and money market accounts where the price sensitivity of such products may vary relative to general markets rates yield curve risk refers to adverse consequences of nonparallel shifts in the yield curves of various market indices that impact our assets and liabilities we use simulation analysis as a primary method to assess earnings at risk and equity at risk due to assumed changes in interest rates management uses the results of its various simulation analyses in combination with other data and observations to formulate strategies designed to maintain interest rate risk within risk tolerances simulation analysis involves the use of several assumptions including but not limited to the timing of cash flows such as the terms of contractual agreements investment security calls loan prepayment speeds deposit attrition rates the interest rate sensitivity of loans and deposits relative to general market rates and the behavior of interest rates and spreads equity at risk simulation uses assumptions regarding discount rates that value cash flows simulation analysis is highly dependent on model assumptions that may vary from actual outcomes key simulation assumptions are subject to sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of assumption changes on earnings at risk and equity at risk model assumptions are reviewed by our assumptions committee earnings at risk is defined as the percentage change in net interest income due to assumed changes in interest rates earnings at risk is generally used to assess interest rate risk over relatively short time horizons equity at risk is defined as the percentage change in the net economic value of assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates compared to a base net economic value the discounted present value of all cash flows represents our economic value of equity equity at risk is generally considered a measure of the longterm interest rate exposures of the balance sheet at a point in time the earnings simulation models take into account our contractual agreements with regard to investments loans deposits borrowings and derivatives as well as a number of behavioral assumptions applied to certain assets and liabilities mortgage banking derivatives used in the ordinary course of business consist of forward sales contracts and interest rate lock commitments on residential mortgage loans these derivatives involve underlying items such as interest rates and are designed to mitigate risk derivatives are also used to hedge mortgage servicing rights for additional information see note 28derivative financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements from time to time we execute interest rate swaps to hedge some of our interest rate risks under these arrangements the company enters into a variable rate loan with a client in addition to a swap agreement the swap agreement effectively converts the clients variable rate loan into a fixed rate loan the company then enters into a matching swap agreement with a thirdparty dealer to offset its exposure on the customer swap the company may also execute interest rate swap agreements that are not specific to client loans as of december the company did not have such agreements for additional information on these derivatives refer to note 28derivative financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements our interest rate risk key indicators are applied to a static balance sheet using forward rates from the moodys baseline scenario the company will also use other rate forecasts including but not limited to moodys consensus scenario this base case scenario assumes the maturity composition of asset and liability rollover volumes is modeled to approximately replicate current consolidated balance sheet characteristics throughout the simulation these treatments are consistent with the companys goal of assessing current interest rate risk embedded in its current balance sheet the base case scenario assumes that maturing or repricing assets and liabilities are replaced at prices referencing forward rates derived from the selected rate forecast consistent with current balance sheet pricing characteristics key rate drivers are used to price assets and liabilities with sensitivity assumptions used to price nonmaturity deposits the sensitivity assumptions for the pricing of nonmaturity deposits are subjected to sensitivity analysis no less frequently than on an annual basis interest rate shocks are applied to the base case on an instantaneous basis the range of interest rate shocks will include upward and downward movements of rates through basis points in basis point increments at times market conditions may result in assumed rate movements that will be deemphasized for example during a period of ultralow interest rates certain downward rate shocks may be impractical the model simulation results produced from the base case scenario and related instantaneous shocks for changes in net interest income and changes in the economic value of equity are referred to as the core scenario analysis and constitute the policy key risk indicators for interest rate risk when compared to risk tolerances relative to prior modeling and disclosures management revised its deposit beta assumptions higher due to the rapid increase in interest rates and expected further increases previous beta assumptions reflected sensitivities across full interest rate cycles the beta assumptions were revised during the second quarter of to recognize that interest rates have risen while the companys cost of deposits have increased slightly during the fourth quarter of the federal funds target rate increased basis points while the companys total deposit cost increased basis points the revised beta assumptions reflect the acceleration of deposit cost increases associated with the expected increase in short term rates after december these beta assumptions when combined with the minimal increase in deposit costs since the federal funds rate began to rise in march reflect managements estimates across the entire current rising rate cycle the following interest rate risk metrics are derived from analysis using the moodys consensus scenario published in january as the base case the consensus forecast projects an inverted yield curve through year as of december the earnings simulations indicated that the year impact of an instantaneous basis point increase decrease in rates would result in an estimated increase up and decrease down in net interest income we use economic value of equity eve analysis as an indicator of the extent to which the present value of our capital could change given potential changes in interest rates this measure also assumes a static balance sheet base case scenario with rate shocks applied as described above at december the percentage change in eve due to a 100basis point increase or decrease in interest rates was decrease and decrease respectively the percentage changes in eve due to a 200basis point increase or decrease in interest rates were decrease and decrease respectively the interest rate shock analysis results for eve sensitivities are unusual as the benefits of repricing assets are mitigated by increasing deposit costs and downward shocks are constrained on various balance sheet categories due to the inability to price products below floors or zero this is particularly meaningful given the cost of deposits as of december the analysis below reflects a base case and shocked scenarios that assume a static balance sheet projection where volume is added to maintain balances consistent with current levels except for ppp loans that are not assumed to be replaced base case assumes new and repricing volumes reference forward rates derived from the moodys consensus rate forecast instantaneous parallel and sustained interest rate shocks are applied to the base case scenario over a oneyear time horizon

basis points table end libor transition in july the financial conduct authority fca in the united kingdom which regulates libor announced that it intended to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor at the end of on march the fca confirmed that all libor settings would either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative immediately after december for the oneweek and twomonth us dollar settings and immediately after june for all remaining us dollar settings the alternative reference rates committee proposed secured overnight financing rate sofr as its preferred rate as an alternative to libor and proposed a paced market transition plan to sofr from libor organizations are currently working on industrywide and companyspecific transition plans related to derivatives and cash markets exposed to libor as noted within part i item risk factors of the this form 10k for the year ended we hold instruments that may be impacted by the discontinuance of libor including floating rate obligations loans deposits derivatives and hedges and other financial instruments but is not able to currently predict the associated financial impact of the transition to an alternative reference rate we have established a crossfunctional libor transition working group that has assessed the companys current exposure to libor indexed instruments and the data systems and processes that will be impacted established a detailed implementation plan and developed a formal governance structure for the transition the company has developed and continues to implement various proactive steps to facilitate the transition on behalf of customers which include table start the adoption and ongoing implementation of fallback provisions that provide for the determination of replacement rates for liborlinked financial products table endtable start the adoption of new products linked to alternative reference rates such as adjustablerate mortgages consistent with guidance provided by the us regulators the alternative reference rates committee and gses table endtable start the selection of sofr indices as the replacement indices and successful completion of systems testing using the sofr replacement indices table end the company discontinued quoting libor on september and discontinued originating new products linked to libor on december we intend to use the provisions of the adjustable interest rate libor act passed by congress and signed in to law by the president in march for certain contracts referencing libor the act provides for the use of sofr as the replacement index with a spread adjustment when the remaining libor indices are discontinued the act applies when there is no contract provision addressing the loss of libor and may be used otherwise as well provided the contract does not provide for a specific replacement index this aligns with the plan of action currently under implementation by the company the final rule implementing the act was released on december the company continues to evaluate its financial and operational infrastructure in its effort to transition all financial and strategic processes systems and models to reference rates other than libor the company is in the process of developing and implementing processes to educate clientfacing associates and coordinate communications with customers regarding the transition as of december the company had the following exposures to libor table start approximately billion of total outstanding loans referencing libor of this amount billion have maturities occurring after the libor discontinuation date of june table endtable start approximately billion in interest rate swaps that are indexed to libor with a gross positive fair value of million inclusive of million of variation margin settlements and a gross negative fair value of million however the interest rate swaps associated with this program do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements therefore the transition to libor will have no hedge accounting impact as changes in the fair value of both the customer swaps and the offsetting swaps are recognized directly in earnings moreover the exposure of both sides of these swaps is presented in these figures these exposures are intended to offset each other table endtable start trust preferred securities that reference libor and had a total principal balance of million these securities have maturities ranging from october through march table end asset credit risk and concentrations the quality of our interest earning assets is maintained through our management of certain concentrations of credit risk we review each individual earning asset including investment securities and loans for credit risk to facilitate this review we have established credit and investment policies that include credit limits documentation periodic examination and follow up in addition we examine these portfolios for exposure to concentration in any one industry government agency or geographic location loan and deposit concentration we have no material concentration of deposits from any single customer or group of customers we have no significant portion of our loans concentrated within a single industry or group of related industries furthermore we attempt to avoid making loans that in an aggregate amount exceed of total loans to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar business activities at december and there were no aggregated loan concentrations of this type we do not believe there are any material seasonal factors that would have a material adverse effect on us we do not have material foreign loans or deposits concentration of credit risk each category of earning assets has a certain degree of credit risk we use various techniques to measure credit risk credit risk in the investment portfolio can be measured through bond ratings published by independent agencies in the investment securities portfolio the investments consist of us governmentsponsored entity securities tax free securities or other securities having ratings of aaa to not rated all securities with the exception of those that are not rated were rated by at least one of the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations the credit risk of the loan portfolio can be measured by historical experience we maintain our loan portfolio in accordance with credit policies that we have established although the bank has a diversified loan portfolio a substantial portion of our borrowers abilities to honor their contracts is dependent upon economic conditions within our geographic footprint and the surrounding regions we consider concentrations of credit to exist when pursuant to regulatory guidelines the amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar business activities which would cause them to be similarly impacted by general economic conditions represents of total tier capital plus regulatory adjusted allowance for credit losses of the company or billion at december based on this criteria we had eight such credit concentrations at december including loans on hotels and motels of billion loans to lessors of nonresidential buildings except miniwarehouses of billion loans secured by owner occupied office buildings including medical office buildings of billion loans secured by owner occupied nonresidential buildings excluding office buildings of billion loans to lessors of residential buildings investment properties and multifamily of billion loans secured by st mortgage family owner occupied residential property including condos and home equity lines of billion loans secured by jumbo original loans greater than st mortgage family owner occupied residential property of billion and loans secured by business assets including accounts receivable inventory and equipment of billion the risk for these loans and for all loans is managed collectively through the use of credit underwriting practices developed and updated over time the loss estimate for these loans is determined using our standard acl methodology after the adoption of cecl in the first quarter of banking regulators established guidelines for calculating credit concentrations banking regulators set the guidelines for construction land development and other land loans to total less than of total tier capital less modified cecl transitional amount plus acl cdl concentration ratio and for total commercial real estate loans construction land development and other land loans along with other nonowner occupied commercial real estate and multifamily loans to total less than of total tier capital less modified cecl transitional amount plus acl cre concentration ratio both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by the banks total tier capital less modified cecl transitional amount plus acl at december the banks cdl concentration ratio was and its cre concentration ratio was at dece mber the banks cdl concentration ratio was and its cre concentration ratio was as of december and the bank was below the established regulatory guidelines when a banks ratios are in excess of one or both of these loan concentration ratios guidelines banking regulators generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by bank management therefore we monitor these two ratios as part of our concentration management processes effect of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require the measure of financial position and results of operations in terms of historical dollars without consideration of changes in the relative purchasing power over time due to inflation unlike most other industries the majority of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature as a result interest rates generally have a more significant effect on a financial institutions performance than does the effect of inflation interest rates do not necessarily change in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services while the effect of inflation on banks is normally not as significant as is its influence on those businesses which have large investments in plant and inventories it does have an effect during periods of high inflation there are normally corresponding increases in money supply and banks will normally experience above average growth in assets loans and deposits also general increases in the prices of goods and services will result in increased operating expenses inflation also affects our banks customers and may result in an indirect effect on our banks business contractual obligations the following table presents payment schedules for certain of our contractual obligations as of december longterm debt obligations totaling million include trust preferred junior subordinated debt and corporate subordinated debt operating and finance
