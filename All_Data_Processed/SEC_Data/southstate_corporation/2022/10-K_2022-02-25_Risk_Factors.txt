factors an investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent in our business the following discussion highlights the risks that management believes are material for our company but do not necessarily include all the risks that we may face you should carefully consider the risk factors and uncertainties described below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k report in evaluating an investment in our common stock risks relating to our business and business strategy we face risks and uncertainties related to our proposed merger with acbi the company and acbi operate and until the completion of the merger will continue to operate independently there can be no assurances that the businesses of the company and acbi can be integrated successfully it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key company or acbi employees the loss of customers the disruption of either companys ongoing businesses inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies unexpected integration issues higher than expected integration costs and an overall postcompletion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated the success of the merger will depend on among other things the ability of the company and acbi to combine their businesses in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and realizes cost savings however if the combined company is not able to successfully achieve these objectives the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected failure to complete our proposed merger with acbi could negatively impact our business financial results and stock price if our proposed merger with acbi is not completed for any reason our ongoing business may be adversely affected and without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the merger we will be subject to a number of risks including the following table start we will be required to pay certain costs relating to the merger whether or not the merger is completed such as legal accounting financial advisor and printing fees table endtable start the acbi merger agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of both the companys and acbis business before completion of the merger which may adversely affect our ability to execute certain of our business strategies and table end table start matters relating to the merger are requiring substantial commitments of time and resources by our management which could have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us as an independent company table end in addition if the merger is not completed we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from our customers and employees for example we may be impacted adversely by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the merger without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the merger the market price of our common stock could decline to the extent that the current market prices reflect a market assumption that the merger will be completed we also could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or to proceedings commenced against us to perform our obligations under the acbi merger agreement if the merger is not completed we cannot assure you that the risks described above will not materialize and will not materially affect our business financial results and stock price the company may not be able to integrate successfully the companies or to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger assuming the merger is approved the successful integration of systems and operations will depend substantially on the companys ability to consolidate successfully corporate cultures management teams operations systems processes and procedures and to eliminate redundancies and costs while we have substantial experience in successfully integrating institutions we have acquired we may encounter difficulties during integration such as table start the loss of key employees and clients table endtable start the disruption of operations and businesses table endtable start inability to maintain and increase competitive presence in the atlanta market table endtable start loan deposit and revenue attrition table endtable start inconsistencies in standards control procedures and policies table endtable start unexpected issues with costs operations personnel technology and table endtable start problems with the assimilation of new operations sites or personnel table end integration activities could divert resources from regular operations in addition general market and economic conditions or governmental actions affecting the financial industry generally may inhibit the companys successful integration of these entities the company and acbi entered into the acbi merger agreement with the expectation that the merger would result in various synergies including among other things benefits relating to enhanced revenues a strengthened and expanded market position for the combined organization in the atlanta market technology efficiencies cost savings and operating efficiencies achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger is subject to a number of uncertainties including whether the company integrates the institutions in an efficient and effective manner as well as general competitive factors in the marketplace failure to achieve or delays in achieving these anticipated benefits could result in a share price reduction as well as increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of managements time and energy and could materially and adversely affect the companys financial condition results of operations business and prospects the company will continue to incur substantial expenses related to the acbi merger and the integration the company must integrate acbis processes policies procedures operations technologies and systems in addition the merger may increase the companys compliance and legal risks including increased litigation or regulatory actions such as fines or restrictions related to the business practices or operations of the combined business while the company has assumed that a certain level of expenses would be incurred many factors beyond the companys control could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration expenses moreover many of the expenses that the company will incur are by their nature difficult to estimate accurately these expenses could particularly in the near term exceed the expected savings from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale the amount and timing of future charges to earnings as a result of merger or integration expenses are uncertain the company will continue to incur substantial expenses related to the conversion and integration of the centerstate merger while the company completed the conversion of systems in connection with the centerstate merger in may we continue to address clean up integration tasks which could delay the realization of merger synergies and increase the companys compliance and operational costs while the company has assumed that a certain level of expenses would be incurred many factors beyond the companys control could affect the total amount or the timing of any remaining integration expenses moreover many of the expenses that the company will incur are by their nature difficult to estimate accurately these expenses could particularly in the near term exceed the expected savings from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale the amount and timing of future charges to earnings as a result of merger or integration expenses are uncertain the covid19 pandemic has adversely affected our business financial condition and results of operations and the ultimate impacts of the pandemic on our business financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments and other factors that are highly uncertain and will be impacted by the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic although the global economy has begun to recover from the covid19 pandemic as many health and safety restrictions have been lifted and vaccine distribution has increased certain adverse consequences of the pandemic continue to impact the macroeconomic environment and may persist for some time including labor shortages and disruptions of global supply chains these consequences of the pandemic have resulted in significant adverse effects for many different types of businesses nationwide and in the regions in which we operate including among others those in the travel hospitality and food and beverage industries the global supply chain has been drastically disrupted during the pandemic and remains challenged as it adapts and responds in part as a result inflation has exceeded the federal reserves two percent annual target and there is a risk that inflation may become higher or persist for longer periods of time and not decrease even as supply chain issues are resolved additional impacts of the covid19 pandemic on our business could be widespread and material and may include or exacerbate among other consequences the following table start employees contracting covid19 table endtable start reductions in our operating effectiveness as our employees work from home table endtable start work stoppages forced quarantines or other interruptions of our business table endtable start employee fatigue as a result of the length of the pandemic response table endtable start unavailability of key personnel necessary to conduct our business activities table endtable start effects on key employees including operational management personnel and those charged with preparing monitoring and evaluating our financial reporting and internal controls table endtable start increased cybersecurity risks as of the workforce works from home table endtable start sustained closures of our branch lobbies or the offices of our customers table endtable start declines in demand for loans and other banking services and products table endtable start reduced consumer spending due to both job losses and other effects attributable to the covid19 pandemic table endtable start volatile performance of our investment securities portfolio table endtable start decline in the credit quality of our loan portfolio owing to the effects of the covid19 pandemic in the markets we serve leading to a need to increase our allowance for credit losses table endtable start declines in value of collateral for loans including real estate collateral table endtable start declines in the net worth and liquidity of borrowers and loan guarantors impairing their ability to honor commitments to us table endtable start a reduction in fee income from reduced demand for loans and deposit services table endtable start a reduction of net interest margin from reductions in interest rates and the yield curve table end table start an increase in expenses and table endtable start declines in demand resulting from businesses being deemed to be nonessential by governments in the markets we serve and from nonessential and essential businesses suffering adverse effects from reduced levels of economic activity in our markets table end a resurgence of the pandemic or a decrease in the effectiveness of vaccines could worsen these impacts and also affect the companys capital and liquidity position cause an outflow of deposits cause significant property damage in case of civil unrest or vandalism influence the recognition of credit losses on loans and securities and increase the allowance for credit losses result in additional lost revenue cause additional increases in expenses result in goodwill impairment charges result in the impairment of other financial and nonfinancial assets and increase the companys cost of capital these factors together or in combination with other events or occurrences that may not yet be known or anticipated may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations the ongoing covid19 pandemic resulted in more volatile stock prices for many companies including our own as well as the trading prices for many other securities during the further spread of the covid19 outbreak as well as ongoing or new governmental regulatory and private sector responses to the pandemic may not be successful or may result in increased pressure on the banking sector other economic activity generally and in the areas in which we operate while loan demand has increased during the second half of any new or increased spread of the covid19 virus or increase in interest rates to address inflationary pressures could result in declines in demand for our banking products and services and could negatively impact among other things our liquidity regulatory capital goodwill and our growth strategy in addition while net interest margin has been and is likely to continue to be affected by the very low interest rate environment any increase in rates may increase the margin allowing us to earn more on our assets the company participated in the sbas ppp as an eligible lender with the benefit of a government guaranty of loans to small business clients many of whom may face difficulties even after being granted such a loan the company faces increased risks in terms of credit fraud risk and litigation in light of its participation in these programs any one or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we are taking precautions to protect the safety and wellbeing of our employees and customers however the company can make no assurance that the steps being taken will be adequate or deemed to be appropriate nor can we predict the level of disruption which will occur to our employees ability to provide customer support and service if we are unable to recover from a business disruption on a timely basis our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected we may also incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions which could further adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations the implementation of new lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risk we continuously evaluate our service offerings and may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business in new sales channels such as online and mobile banking in the future there are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts in developing and marketing new lines of business andor new products and services we undergo a new product process to assess the risks of and resources needed for the initiative and invest significant time and resources to build internal controls policies and procedures to mitigate those risks including hiring experienced management to oversee the implementation of the initiative initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business andor new products or services andor new sales channels may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible external factors such as compliance with regulations competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business andor a new product or service andor sales channels furthermore any new line of business andor new product or service could require the establishment of new key and other controls and have a significant impact on our existing system of internal controls failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business andor new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations the adoption of the current expected credit loss cecl standard the merger activity and the covid19 pandemic may result in increased volatility and further increases in our allowance for credit losses acl the measure of our acl is dependent on the adoption and interpretation of applicable accounting standards as well as external events including the centerstate and acbi mergers and the covid19 pandemic we adopted the financial accounting standards boards current expected credit loss or cecl standard in the first quarter of under the cecl model we are required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost such as loans held for investment and held to maturity debt securities at the net amount expected to be collected the measurement of expected credit losses is based on information about past events including historical experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount and certain management judgments over the life of the loan this initial measurement took place as of january at the time of our adoption of cecl the cecl model may create more volatility in the level of our acl as compared to the incurred loss standard that we previously applied in determining our acl the cecl model requires us to estimate the lifetime expected credit loss with respect to loans and other applicable financial assets which may change more rapidly than the level of incurred losses that would have been used to determine our allowance for loan losses under the prior incurred loss standard while the company has reduced the acl over the past several quarters the potentially material effects of the continuation of the covid19 pandemic on lifetime expected credit loss and the challenges associated with estimating lifetime credit losses in view of the uncertain ultimate impacts of the pandemic has resulted and may continue to result in increased volatility and significant additions to our acl in the future which could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the companys estimate of its acl involves a high degree of judgment therefore the companys process for determining expected credit losses may result in a range of expected credit losses it is possible that others given the same information may at any point in time reach a different reasonable conclusion further if managements assumptions and judgments prove to be incorrect and the allowance for credit losses is inadequate to absorb losses going forward or if bank regulatory authorities require us to increase the allowance for credit losses as a part of their examination process our earnings and capital could be significantly and adversely affected technological changes including online and mobile banking have the potential of disrupting our business model and we may have fewer resources than many competitors to invest in technological improvements the financial services industry continues to undergo rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technologydriven products and services including mobile and online banking services changes in customer behaviors have increased the need to offer these options to our customers further the occurrence and continuation of the covid19 pandemic has accelerated technological change as our employees and the customers and communities to which we provide products and services experienced quarantines cancellation of events and travel business and school shutdowns reduction in business activity and financial transactions and supply chain interruptions in addition to serving clients better investments in and the effective use of technology may increase efficiency and may enable financial institutions to reduce costs these investments may not be sufficient or provide the anticipated benefits or desired return we can make no assurance that investments will be sufficient to retain existing customers or attract new customers in the future our future success will depend in part upon our ability to invest in and use technology to provide products and services that provide convenience to customers and to create additional efficiencies in operations one of our strategic goals is to continue to focus on technological change and digital transformation of our product and service channels which will impact how we deliver our products and services in the future as well as make our internal processes more efficient we will need to make significant additional capital investments in technology in the future to achieve this strategic goal and we may not be able to implement effectively new technologydriven products and services in a timely manner in response to changes in customer behaviors thus adversely impacting our operations many competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements than the company our business strategy includes continued growth and our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively we intend to continue pursuing a growth strategy for our business our prospects must be considered in light of the risks expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in significant growth stages of development our ability to continue to grow successfully will depend on a variety of factors including economic conditions in the markets in which we operate as well as in the us and globally continued availability of desirable business opportunities the competitive responses from other financial and nonfinancial institution competitors in our market areas our ability to continue to implement and improve our operational credit financial management and other risks controls and processes and our reporting systems and procedures to manage a growing number of client relationships and our ability to integrate our acquisitions and develop consistent policies throughout our various businesses while we believe we have the management and other resources and internal systems in place to successfully manage our future growth and we are expanding those resources and systems as we continue to grow there can be no assurance growth opportunities will be available or growth will be successfully managed in addition if we are unable to manage future expansion in our operations we may experience compliance and operational problems have to slow the pace of growth or have to incur additional expenditures beyond current projections to support such growth any of which could adversely affect our business particularly in light of prevailing economic and competitive conditions we cannot assure you we will be able to expand our market presence in our existing markets or successfully enter new markets or that any such expansion will not adversely affect our results of operations failure to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business future prospects financial condition or results of operations and could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategy also if our growth occurs more slowly than anticipated or declines our operating results could be materially adversely affected a significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate and events that negatively impact the real estate market could hurt our business a significant portion of our loan portfolios are secured by real estate as of december approximately of such loans had real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral the real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended there can be no assurance that our local markets will not experience another economic decline a decline in local economic conditions may have a greater effect on our earnings and capital than on the earnings and capital of other financial institutions whose real estate loan portfolios are more geographically diverse deterioration in the real estate market could cause us to adjust our opinion of the level of credit quality in our loan portfolio such a determination may lead to an additional increase in our allowance for credit losses which could also adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations our loan portfolio includes commercial and commercial real estate loans that may have higher risks our commercial and commercial real estate loans at december and were billion and billion respectively or of total loans commercial and commercial real estate loans generally carry larger loan balances and can involve a greater degree of financial and credit risk than other loans the increased financial and credit risk associated with these types of loans are a result of several factors including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers the size of loan balances the effects of general economic conditions on incomeproducing properties and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring these types of loans as a result banking regulators give greater scrutiny to lenders with a high concentration of commercial real estate loans in their portfolios and such lenders are expected to implement stricter underwriting internal controls risk management policies and portfolio stress testing as well as maintain higher capital levels and loss allowances the guidance states that the following metrics may indicate a concentration of commercial real estate loans but that these metrics are neither limits nor a safe harbor table start total reported loans for construction land development and other land equal or more of total risk based capital as of december our bank ratio was and table endtable start total reported loans secured by multifamily and nonfarm nonresidential properties and loans for construction land development and other land equal or more of total riskbased capital as of december our bank ratio was table end regulators may require banks to maintain elevated levels of capital or liquidity due to commercial real estate loan concentrations and could do so especially if there is a downturn in our local real estate markets see part i item supervision and regulation lending standards and guidance for further details on the guidance furthermore the repayment of loans secured by commercial real estate is typically dependent upon the successful operation of the related real estate or commercial project if the cash flows from the project are reduced a borrowers ability to repay the loan may be impaired this cash flow shortage may result in the failure to make loan payments in such cases we may be compelled to modify the terms of the loan in addition the nature of these loans is such that they are generally less predictable and more difficult to evaluate and monitor as a result repayment of these loans may to a greater extent than residential loans be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or economy we may not be able to adequately anticipate and respond to changes in market interest rates we may be unable to anticipate changes in market interest rates which are affected by many factors beyond our control including but not limited to inflation recession unemployment money supply monetary policy and other changes that affect financial markets both domestic and foreign our net interest income is affected not only by the level and direction of interest rates but also by the shape of the yield curve and relationships between interest sensitive instruments and key driver rates as well as balance sheet growth customer loan and deposit preferences and the timing of changes in these variables in the event rates increase our interest costs on liabilities may increase more rapidly than our income on interest earning assets thus a deterioration of net interest margins as such fluctuations in interest rates could have significant adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations our net interest income may decline based on the interest rate environment we depend on our net interest income to drive our profitability net interest income is the difference between the interest income we receive from interest earning assets eg loans and investment securities and the interest expense we pay on interestbearing liabilities eg deposits and borrowings we are exposed to changes in general interest rate levels and other economic factors beyond our control and an increase in our cost of funds could negatively impact our net interest income net interest income will decline in a particular period if table start in a declining interest rate environment more interest earning assets than interest bearing liabilities re price or mature or table endtable start in a rising interest rate environment more interestbearing liabilities than interest earning assets re price or mature or table endtable start for acquired loans expected total cash flows decline as our loan balances decline table end our net interest income may decline based on our exposure to a difference in short term and long term interest rates if the difference between the interest rates shrinks or disappears the difference between rates paid on deposits and received on loans could narrow significantly resulting in a decrease in net interest income in addition to these factors if market interest rates rise rapidly interest rate adjustment caps may limit increases in the interest rates on adjustable rate loans thus reducing our net interest income in addition certain adjustable rate loans re price based on lagging interest rate indices this lagging effect may also negatively impact our net interest income when general interest rates continue to rise periodically while interest rates remain low the federal reserve is expected to begin slowly raising interest rates during we cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary policies or the precise effects that they may have on our activities and financial results in addition our net interest income may be adversely affected by inflationary pressures and global supply chain challenges in part because the global supply chain has been drastically disrupted during the pandemic and remains challenged as it adapts and responds inflation has exceeded the federal reserves two percent annual target there is a risk that inflation may become higher or persist for longer periods of time and not decrease even as supply chain issues are resolved while loan demand has increased during the second half of any increase in interest rates to address inflationary pressures could result in declines in demand for our banking products and services and could negatively impact among other things our liquidity regulatory capital goodwill and our growth strategy if we fail to effectively manage credit risk and interest rate risk our business and financial condition will suffer we must effectively manage credit risk there are risks inherent in making any loan including risks with respect to the period of time over which the loan may be repaid risks relating to proper loan underwriting and guidelines risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers and risks resulting from uncertainties as to the future value of collateral there is no assurance that our credit risk monitoring and loan approval procedures are or will be adequate or will reduce the inherent risks associated with lending our credit administration personnel policies and procedures may not adequately adapt to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting customers and the quality of our loan portfolio any failure to manage such credit risks may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we must also effectively manage interest rate risk because mortgage loans typically have much longer maturities than deposits or other types of funding rising interest rates can raise the cost of funding relative to the value of the mortgage loan we manage this risk in part by holding adjustable rate mortgages in portfolios and through other means conversely the value of our mortgage servicing assets may fall when interest rates fall as borrowers refinance into lower rate loans given current rates material reductions in rates may not be probable but as rates rise this risk increases there can be no assurance that we will successfully manage the lending and servicing businesses through all future interest rate environments the results of our most recent stress tests may not accurately predict the impact on our financial condition if the economy were to deteriorate we perform capital stress testing on an annual basis using the stress testing assumptions provided by the regulators for the ccar stress tests we perform liquidity stress testing and credit stress testing on a quarterly basis under the capital stress test we estimate our loan losses loan chargeoffs resources available to absorb those losses and any necessary additions to capital that would be required under the more adverse stress test scenario the results of these stress tests involve many assumptions about the economy and future loan losses and default rates and may not accurately reflect the impact on our financial condition if the economy were to deteriorate any deterioration of the economy could result in credit losses significantly higher with a corresponding impact on our financial condition and capital than those predicted by our internal stress test our size and continued pace of growth may require us to raise additional capital in the future but that capital may not be available when it is needed we are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations our ability to raise capital if needed in the future to meet capital requirements or otherwise will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time which are outside our control and on our financial performance accordingly there is no assurance as to our ability to raise additional capital if needed on terms acceptable to us if we cannot raise additional capital when needed our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be materially impaired our processes for managing risk may not be effective in mitigating risk or losses to us the objectives of our risk management processes are to mitigate risk and loss to our organization we have established an enterprise risk framework and program that are intended to identify measure monitor report and analyze the types of risks to which we are subject including liquidity risk credit risk market risk interest rate risk operational risk cybersecurity risk corporate governance and legal risk compliance risk and reputational risk among others however this framework will evolve as we expect to become subject to heightened expectations from the occ as we grow above billion in assets in addition as with any risk management process there are inherent limitations to our risk management strategies as there may exist or develop in the future risks that we have not appropriately anticipated or identified the ongoing developments in the financial institutions industry continue to highlight both the importance and some of the limitations of managing unanticipated risks if our risk management processes prove ineffective we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected the continued buildout of our mortgage line of business may subject us to additional risk we continued to build our mortgage line of business in and in so doing invested significant time and resources to continue to expand the mortgage business within our market areas our price and profitability targets for this business may not prove feasible due to unexpected delays in the continued implementation of these strategies as well as external factors such as compliance with regulations competitive alternatives changing tax rates and strategies interest rates economic conditions the continuance of the covid19 pandemic and shifting market preferences which could impact the profitability of these lines of business and have a material adverse effect on our businesses and in turn our financial condition and results of operations our recent results may not be indicative of our future results we may not be able to sustain our historical rate of growth or may not even be able to grow our business at all in addition our recent growth may distort some of our historical financial ratios and statistics various factors such as economic conditions regulatory and legislative considerations and competition may also impede or prohibit our ability to expand our market presence if we experience a significant decrease in our historical rate of growth our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected due to a high percentage of our operating costs being fixed expenses we are subject to environmental risks in our lending activities because a significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property we may foreclose upon and take title to such property in the ordinary course of business if hazardous substances were discovered on any of these properties we may be liable to governmental agencies or third parties for the full costs of remediation as well as for related personal injury and property damage environmental laws might require us to incur substantial expenses materially reduce the propertys value or limit our ability to use or sell the property although our management has policies requiring environmental reviews before loans secured by real property are made and before foreclosure is commenced it is still possible that environmental risks might not be detected and that the associated costs might have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations many environmental laws impose liability regardless of whether the company knew of or were responsible for the contamination in addition banks credit and underwriting policies that result in funding fossil fuel projects may impact climate change and lead to increased green house gas emissions banks have very limited control over the actions of their clients and while banks can monitor client emissions and environmental profiles information currently available is insufficient to assess both climate risk and the financial risk inherent in making lending decisions accordingly the bank may be unable to assess how our lending decisions affect both our risk profile and our profitability as well as our clients efforts to address climate change while we use appraisals in deciding whether to make a loan that is secured by real estate they do not ensure the value of the real property collateral in deciding whether to make a loan secured by real property we generally require an appraisal however an appraisal is only an estimate of the value of the property at the time the appraisal is made if the appraised amount does not reflect the amount that may be obtained upon any sale or foreclosure of the property we may not realize an amount equal to the indebtedness secured by the property we are subject to losses due to errors omissions or fraudulent behavior by our employees clients counterparties or other third parties we are exposed to many types of operational risk including the risk of fraud by third parties customers and employees clerical recordkeeping errors and transactional errors like the financial services industry overall we have seen an increase in fraudulent attempts on debit cards and accounts during in part due to the material increase in online including card not present transactions during the covid19 pandemic while our procedures are designed to follow customary industryspecific security precautions and while we provide employees with ongoing training tabletop exercises and regular communications and guidance to combat fraud our efforts might not be successful in mitigating or reducing fraudulent attempts resulting in financial losses increased litigation risk and reputational harm our business also is dependent on our employees as well as thirdparty service providers to process a large number of increasingly complex transactions we could be materially and adversely affected if employees clients counterparties or other third parties caused an operational breakdown or failure either as a result of human error fraudulent manipulation or purposeful damage to any of our operations or systems in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties we may rely on information furnished to us by or on behalf of clients and counterparties including financial statements and other financial information we also may rely on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and with respect to financial statements on reports of independent auditors for example in deciding whether to extend credit to clients we may assume that a customers audited financial statements conform to gaap and present fairly in all material respects the financial condition results of operations and cash flows of the customer our earnings are significantly affected by our ability to properly originate underwrite and service loans our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted to the extent we incorrectly assess the creditworthiness of our borrowers fail to detect or respond to deterioration in asset quality in a timely manner or rely on financial statements that do not comply with gaap or are materially misleading we are subject to environmental social and governance esg risks that could adversely affect our reputation the trading price of our common stock andor our business operations and earnings governments investors customers and the general public are increasingly focused on esg practices and disclosures for us and others in the financial services industry this focus extends to the practices and disclosures of the customers counterparties and service providers with whom we choose to do business in addition certain organizations that provide corporate governance and other corporate risk information to investors and shareholders have developed scores and ratings to evaluate companies based upon esg metrics currently there are no universal standards for such scores or ratings but the importance of esg evaluations is becoming more broadly accepted by investors and shareholders views about esg are diverse dynamic and rapidly changing and if we were to fail to maintain appropriate esg practices and disclosures or be subject to a low esg score or rating we could face potential negative esgrelated publicity in traditional and social media including based on the identity of those we choose to do business with and the publics view of those customers if we or our relationships with customers vendors and suppliers were to become the subject of such negative publicity or low esg scores or ratings our ability to attract and retain customers and employees may be negatively impacted and our stock price may also be impacted additionally investors have begun to consider how corporations are addressing esg matters when making investment decisions for example certain investors are beginning to incorporate the business risks of climate change and the adequacy of companies responses to climate change and other esg matters as part of their investment theses any such negative publicity regarding esg low esg scores or ratings or shifts in investing priorities may result in adverse effects on the trading price of our common stock andor our business operations and earnings if investors shareholders or other stakeholders determine that we have not adequately considered or addressed esg matters a lack of liquidity could affect our operations and jeopardize our financial condition liquidity is essential to our business an inability to raise funds through deposits borrowings the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity our funding sources include core deposits federal funds purchased securities sold under repurchase agreements noncore deposits and short and longterm debt other sources of liquidity are available to us should they be needed including our ability to acquire additional noncore deposits the issuance and sale of debt securities a secured line of credit we have with us bank and the issuance and sale of preferred or common securities in public or private transactions our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our activities or on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general our ability to borrow could be impaired by factors that are not specific to us such as further disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry in light of the recent turmoil faced by banking organizations and the continued deterioration in credit markets our business could suffer if we fail to maintain our culture and attract and retain skilled people our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain competent experienced people our strategic goals in particular require that we be able to attract qualified and experienced retail and commercial lending officers mortgage loan officers and sba lenders in our existing markets as well as those markets in which we may want to expand who share our relationship banking philosophy and have those customer relationships that will allow us to grow successfully we also need to attract and retain qualified and experienced technology risk and backoffice personnel to operate our business many of our competitors are pursuing the same relationship banking strategy in our markets and are looking to hire and retain qualified technology risk and backoffice personnel which increases the competition to identify hire and retain talented employees the centerstate merger and the integration of the companys and centerstates operations and employees into one bank creates an additional risk to the companys culture if we fail to consider and account for corporate cultural differences across the two companies we will face increased difficulty in creating a cohesive culture upon integration the ongoing covid19 pandemic has made this cultural integration more challenging as many employees continue working from remote environments which has drastically decreased the opportunities for employees to gather and nurture relationships with colleagues in different departments locations or legacy institutions we have focused and will continue to focus our strategic attention on our employees and our corporate culture including enhancing our employee orientation ongoing general and management training mentoring and employee work environment as well as diversity and employee advancement our failure to maintain our culture and attractive working environment through competitive compensation packages that reward initiative as well as mentoring training and advancement opportunities in order to successfully compete for experienced qualified employees may have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our financial goals and thus adversely affect our future results of operations if we are unable to offer our key management personnel long term incentive compensation including restricted stock units and performance share units as part of their total compensation package we may have difficulty retaining such personnel which would adversely affect our operations and financial performance we have a management team that has substantial experience in banking and financial services in the markets we serve we rely on our management team to achieve and sustain our profitability our future success and profitability are substantially dependent upon this management and banking abilities of our senior executives although we currently have employment agreements in place with our executive management team and our regional presidents we cannot guarantee that our executives will remain with us changes in key personnel and their responsibilities may be disruptive to our business because of their skills customer relationship andor the potential difficulty of promptly replacing them with successors we have historically granted equity awards under an equity compensation plan which includes granting performance share units and restricted stock awards or restricted stock units to key management personnel as part of a competitive compensation package our ability to grant these awards has been vital to attracting retaining and aligning shareholder interest with a talented management team in a highly competitive marketplace shareholder advisory groups have implemented guidelines and issued voting recommendations related to how much equity companies should be able to grant to employees the factors used to formulate these guidelines and voting recommendations include the volatility of a companys share price and are influenced by broader macroeconomic conditions that can change year to year the variables used by shareholder advisory groups to formulate equity plan recommendations may limit our ability to adopt new equity plans in the future in addition the federal banking regulators have issued guidance on executive compensation and have also along with the sec proposed rules that would prohibit certain incentive compensation arrangements we do not believe that the guidance or proposal will impact our current compensation arrangements if we are limited in our ability to grant equity compensation awards we would need to explore offering other compelling alternatives to supplement our compensation including longterm cash compensation plans or significantly increased shortterm cash compensation in order to continue to attract and retain key management personnel if we used these alternatives to longterm equity awards our compensation costs could increase and our financial performance could be adversely affected if we are unable to offer key management personnel longterm incentive compensation including stock options restricted stock or restricted stock units or performance share units as part of their total compensation package we may have difficulty attracting and retaining such personnel which would adversely affect our operations and financial performance we rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel and if we are unable to attract retain develop and motivate our human capital in the form of wellqualified employees our business and results of operations could be harmed we believe our success has depended continues to and in the future will depend on the efforts and talents of our management team and our highly skilled employees and workers our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract develop motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees the loss of any of our senior management or key employees could materially and adversely affect our ability to build on the efforts that they have undertaken and to execute our business plan and we may not be able to find adequate replacements despite our current efforts we cannot ensure that we will be able to retain the services of any members of our senior management or other key employees if we do not succeed in attracting wellqualified employees or developing retaining and motivating our employees our business and results of operations could be harmed we rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure third parties provide key components of our business infrastructure such as our loan and deposit documents underwriting software compliance software product and service offerings core processing and internet connections and network access any disruption in such services provided by these third parties or any failure of these third parties to handle currently or higher volumes of use could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our clients and otherwise to conduct business technological or financial difficulties of one or our thirdparty service providers or their subcontractors could adversely affect our business to the extent those difficulties result in the interruption or discontinuation of services provided by that party in addition one or more of our thirdparty service providers may become subject to cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse loss of destruction of our or our clients confidential proprietary and other information or otherwise disrupt our or our clients or other third parties business operations while we have processes in place to monitor our thirdparty service providers data and information security safeguards we do not control such service providers day to day operations and a successful attack or security breach at one or more of such thirdparty service providers is not within our control the occurrence of any such breaches or failures could damage our reputation result in a loss of customer business and expose us to additional regulatory scrutiny civil litigation and possible financial liability any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations further in some instances we may be responsible for the failure of such third parties to comply with government regulations and our business recovery plan may not be adequate and may not prevent significant interruptions of our operations or substantial losses we may not be insured against all types of losses as a result of thirdparty failures and our insurance coverage may not be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from system failures thirdparty breaches or other disruptions failures in our business structure or in the structure of one or more of our thirdparty service providers could interrupt the operations or increase the cost of doing business a failure andor breach of our operational or securities systems or infrastructure or those of our thirdparty vendors and other service providers including as a result of cyberattacks could disrupt our business result in a disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information damage our reputation increase our costs and cause losses the potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout our business and as a result of our interactions with and reliance on third parties is not limited to our own internal operational functions we depend on our ability to process record and monitor a large number of client transactions on a continuous basis as client public and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security have increased we must continue to safeguard and monitor our operational systems and infrastructure for potential failures disruptions and breakdowns our business financial accounting data processing or other operating systems and facilities may stop operating properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control although we have information and data security business continuity plans and other safeguards in place our business operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and clients we rely on our employees and third parties in our daytoday and ongoing operations who may as a result of human error misconduct malfeasance or failure or breach of our or of thirdparty systems or infrastructure expose us to risk for example our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to us or to third parties with whom we interact or upon whom we rely in addition our ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to thirdparty systems is more limited than with respect to our own systems our financial accounting data processing backup or other operating or security systems and infrastructure may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our ability to control which could adversely affect our ability to process transactions or provide services such events may include sudden increases in customer transaction volume electrical telecommunications or other major physical infrastructure outages natural disasters such as earthquakes tornadoes hurricanes and floods disease pandemics and events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters including wars and terrorist acts in addition we may need to take our systems offline if they become infected with malware or a computer virus or as a result of another form of cyberattack in the event that backup systems are utilized they may not process data as quickly as our primary systems and some data might not have been saved to backup systems potentially resulting in a temporary or permanent loss of such data we frequently update our systems to support our operations and growth and to remain compliant with all applicable laws rules and regulations this updating entails significant costs and creates risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones including business interruptions implementation and testing of controls related to our computer systems security monitoring and retaining and training personnel required to operate our systems also entail significant costs operational risk exposures could adversely impact our results of operations liquidity and financial condition as well as cause reputational harm in addition we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption any failure or interruption in the operation of our communications and information systems could impair or prevent the effective operation of our customer relationship management general ledger deposit lending or other functions while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of a failure or interruption in the operation of our information systems there could be no assurance that any such failures or interruptions will not occur or if they do that they will be adequately addressed the occurrence of any failures or interruptions impacting our information systems could damage our reputation result in a loss of customer business and expose us to additional regulatory scrutiny civil litigation and possible financial liability any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations we face security risks including denial of service attacks hacking social engineering attacks targeting our colleagues and customers malware intrusion or data corruption attempts and identity theft that could result in the disclosure of confidential information adversely affect our business or reputation and create significant legal and financial exposure our computer systems and network infrastructure and those of third parties on which we are highly dependent are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyberattacks such as denial of service attacks hacking terrorist activities or identity theft our business relies on the secure processing transmission storage and retrieval of confidential proprietary and other information in our computer and data management systems and networks and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties in addition to access our network products and services our customers and other third parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of our network environment and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks we our customers regulators and other third parties including other financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have been subject to and are likely to continue to be the target of cyberattacks these cyberattacks include computer viruses malicious or destructive code phishing attacks denial of service attacks ransomware improper access by employees or vendors attacks on personal email of employees ransom demands to not expose security vulnerabilities in our systems or the systems of third parties or other security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of confidential proprietary and other information of ours our employees our customers or of third parties damage our systems or otherwise materially disrupt our or our customers or other third parties network access or business operations as cyber threats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents despite efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and implement controls processes policies and other protective measures we may not be able to anticipate all security breaches nor may we be able to implement guaranteed preventive measures against such security breaches cyber threats are rapidly evolving and we may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss cybersecurity risks for banking organizations have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies and the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions for example cybersecurity risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobilepayment and other internetbased product offerings and expand our internal usage of webbased products and applications in addition cybersecurity risks have significantly increased in recent years in part due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime affiliates terrorist organizations hostile foreign governments disgruntled employees or vendors activists and other external parties including those involved in corporate espionage even the most advanced internal control environment may be vulnerable to compromise targeted social engineering attacks and spear phishing attacks are becoming more sophisticated and are extremely difficult to prevent in such an attack an attacker will attempt to fraudulently induce colleagues customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to its data or that of its clients persistent attackers may succeed in penetrating defenses given enough resources time and motive the techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently may not be recognized until launched and may not be recognized until well after a breach has occurred the risk of a security breach caused by a cyberattack at a vendor or by unauthorized vendor access has also increased in recent years additionally the existence of cyberattacks or security breaches at thirdparty vendors with access to our data may not be disclosed to us in a timely manner we also face indirect technology cybersecurity and operational risks relating to the customers clients and other third parties with whom we do business or upon whom we rely to facilitate or enable our business activities including for example financial counterparties regulators and providers of critical infrastructure such as internet access and electrical power as a result of increasing consolidation interdependence and complexity of financial entities and technology systems a technology failure cyberattack or other information or security breach that significantly degrades deletes or compromises the systems or data of one or more financial entities could have a material impact on counterparties or other market participants including us this consolidation interconnectivity and complexity increases the risk of operational failure on both individual and industrywide bases as disparate systems need to be integrated often on an accelerated basis any thirdparty technology failure cyberattack or other information or security breach termination or constraint could among other things adversely affect our ability to effect transactions service our clients manage our exposure to risk or expand our business in addition we our employees and our customers are increasingly transitioning our and their computing infrastructure to cloudbased computing storage data processing networking and other services which may increase these security risks cyberattacks or other information or security breaches whether directed at us or third parties may result in a material loss or have material consequences furthermore the public perception that a cyberattack on our systems has been successful whether or not this perception is correct may damage our reputation with customers and third parties with whom we do business hacking of personal information and identity theft risks in particular could cause serious reputational harm a successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause us serious negative consequences including our loss of customers and business opportunities significant business disruption to our operations and business misappropriation or destruction of our confidential information andor that of our customers or damage to our or our customers andor third parties computers or systems and could result in a violation of applicable privacy laws and other laws litigation exposure regulatory fines penalties or intervention loss of confidence in our security measures reputational damage reimbursement or other compensatory costs additional compliance costs and could adversely impact our results of operations liquidity and financial condition although to date we have not experienced any material losses related to cyberattacks or other information security breaches there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future we may face risks with respect to future expansion our business growth profitability and market share has been enhanced by us engaging in strategic mergers and acquisitions and de novo branching either within or contiguous to our existing footprint we may acquire other financial institutions or parts of those institutions in the future and engage in additional de novo branching we may also consider and enter into or acquire new lines of business or offer new products or services and through new sales channels such as online and mobile banking as part of our acquisition strategy we seek companies that are culturally similar to us have experienced management and are in markets in which we operate or close to those markets so we can achieve economies of scale we expect to continue to evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities that are presented to us in our current and expected markets and conduct due diligence related to those opportunities as well as negotiate to acquire or merge with other institutions if we announce a transaction we may issue equity securities including common stock and securities convertible into shares of our common stock in connection with future acquisitions we also may issue debt to finance one or more transactions including subordinated debt issuances generally acquisitions of financial institution involve the payment of a premium over book and market values resulting in dilution of our book value and fully diluted earnings per share as well as dilution to our existing shareholders we also face litigation risks with respect to potential mergers and acquisitions and such litigation is common we may incur substantial costs to expand and we can give no assurance such expansion will result in the levels of profits we seek there is no assurance that following any future mergers or acquisitions our integration efforts will be successful or our company after giving effect to the acquisition will achieve increased revenues comparable to or better than our historical experience and failure to realize such expected revenue increases cost savings increases in market presence or other benefits could have a material adverse effect on our financial conditions and results of operations attractive acquisition opportunities may not be available to us in the future while we seek continued organic growth we anticipate continuing to evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities presented to us in our core markets and beyond the number of financial institutions headquartered in our market areas in the southeastern united states and across the country continues to decline through merger and other activity we expect that other banking and financial companies many of which have significantly greater resources will compete with us to acquire financial services businesses this competition as the number of appropriate merger targets decreases could increase prices for potential acquisitions which could reduce our potential returns and reduce the attractiveness of these opportunities to us in addition acquisitions are subject to various regulatory approvals and if we fail to receive the appropriate regulatory approvals we will not be able to consummate an acquisition that we believe is in our best interests among other things our regulators consider our capital liquidity profitability risk management regulatory compliance including with respect to aml obligations consumer protection laws cra obligations and levels of goodwill and intangibles when considering acquisition and expansion proposals the standards by which bank and financial institution acquisitions will be evaluated are currently in flux and some banking organizations including us are experiencing delays in the processing of applications in july president biden issued an executive order on competition that requires the banking agencies to review the standards for bank mergers and the doj has announced that it is reviewing its bank merger guidelines it is expected that these reviews will tighten the standards for bank mergers and may change how the financial stability factor is evaluated in addition some in congress have called for a moratorium of any bank merger and acquisition of greater than billion in assets while the company is still much smaller in asset size than billion we cannot exclude that we may be subject to higher antitrust standards enhanced scrutiny under the financial stability risk factor or have a potential acquisition denied any acquisition could be dilutive to our earnings and shareholders equity per share of our common stock the transition from libor to an alternative rate may adversely affect our business libor and certain other interest rate benchmarks are the subject of recent national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals to reform these reforms have caused and may in the future cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past or to disappear entirely or have other consequences which cannot be predicted the publication of most libor rates ceased as of the end of december while certain us dollar libor tenors are expected to continue to be published until june the us federal banking agencies have encouraged banks to cease entering new contracts that use us dollar libor by december the bank discontinued the use of libor in new contracts as of december a transition away from the widespread use of libor to alternative rates and other potential interest rate benchmark reforms has begun and will continue over the course of the next few years while there is no consensus on what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to libor a group of large banks the alternative reference rate committee selected and the federal reserve bank of new york began publishing in april the secured overnight finance rate sofr as an alternative to libor sofr is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by treasury securities given the depth and robustness of the us treasury repurchase market on july the arrc announced that it is formally recommending cme groups forwardlooking sofr term rates the bank has approved and is using sofr term rates as an alternative to libor in new contracts while the use of sofr term rates appears to have gained significant acceptance following the arrc recommendation at this time it is impossible to predict whether other sofrbased rates will become accepted alternatives to libor the market transition away from libor to an alternative reference rate including sofr is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on our business financial condition and results of operations in particular any such transition could table start adversely impact the value of liborbased securities including certain of our floating rate corporate debentures or our hedging instruments or other securities or financial arrangements given libors role in determining market interest rates globally table endtable start although the bank has implemented language in in its hedging and loan documents to accommodate a change from libor to an alternative pricing benchmark including sofr we may be required to make further changes to existing liborbased products table endtable start prompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect of our preparation and readiness for the replacement of libor with an alternative reference rate table end table start result in disputes litigation or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in liborbased securities and table endtable start require the transition andor development of appropriate systems and analytics to effectively transition our risk management processes from liborbased products to those based on the applicable alternative pricing benchmark such as sofr table end the manner and impact of this transition as well as the effect of these developments on our funding costs loan and investment and trading securities portfolios assetliability management and business is uncertain our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit with the sec is accurately accumulated and communicated to management and recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the secs rules and forms we believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or controls and procedures no matter how well conceived or operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control systems are met these inherent limitations include the reality that judgments and decision making can be faulty that alternative reasoned judgments can be drawn or that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by an authorized override of the controls in addition properly integrating our acquisitions into our disclosure controls and procedures in a timely manner presents challenges accordingly because of the inherent limitations in our controls systems misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected which could result in a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting and the restatement of previously filed financial statements our accounting policies and processes are critical to how we report our financial condition and results of operations and require our management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain accounting policies and processes are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations some of these polices require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results several of our accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles we are required to make certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements including and determining credit loss reserves reserves related to litigation and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities among other items if the assumptions or estimates underling our financial statements are incorrect we may experience material losses certain of our financial instruments including trading assets and liabilities securities and certain loans among other items require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare our financial statements where quoted market prices are not available we may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management judgment some of these and other assets and liabilities may have no direct observable price levels making their valuation particularly subjective being based on significant estimation and judgment in addition some illiquidity in markets and declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance sheet items which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment it could lead to declines in our earnings as a participating lender in the sba ppp the company and the bank continue to be subject to the additional risks of litigation from the banks customers or other parties regarding the banks processing of loans and related forgiveness for the ppp and risks that the sba may not fund some or all ppp loan guaranties laws enacted during the pandemic included a loan program administered through the sba referred to as the ppp the sba expanded this program in january to allow eligible companies that obtained loans through the first round of ppp to obtain additional loans as well as allow eligible companies that had not yet obtained a loan under the ppp to do so the bank participated as a lender in two rounds of the ppp and we originated approximately billion though the ppp program of which all but approximately or million excluding unamortized deferred fees and costs has been forgiven if ppp borrowers fail to qualify for loan forgiveness the bank faces a heightened risk of holding these loans at unfavorable interest rates for an extended period of time while the ppp loans are guaranteed by the sba various regulatory requirements will apply to the banks ability to seek recourse under the guarantees the bank also has credit risk on outstanding ppp loans if a determination is made by the sba that there is a deficiency in the manner in which the loan was originated funded or serviced by the bank such as an issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive a ppp loan which may or may not be related to the ambiguity in the laws rules and guidance regarding the operation of the ppp such deficiency also may be found in the event the bank discovers any evidence of fraud relating to a ppp loan in the event of a loss resulting from a default on a ppp loan and a determination by the sba that there was a deficiency in the manner in which the ppp loan was originated funded or serviced by the company or evidence of fraud the sba may deny its liability under the guaranty reduce the amount of the guaranty or if it has already paid under the guaranty seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from the company incidents of borrower fraud in connection with ppp loans also might expose the company to additional litigation risk regulatory scrutiny and reputational damage which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operational results the value of securities in our investment portfolio may decline in the future as of december we owned billion of investment securities the fair value of our investment securities may be adversely affected by market conditions including changes in interest rates and the occurrence of any events adversely affecting the issuer of particular securities in our investments portfolio with adoption of accounting standards codification asc effective january we no longer evaluate securities for otherthantemporary impairments as the new accounting guidance changes the accounting for recognizing impairment on available for sale and held to maturity securities we analyze our available for sale securities on a quarterly basis on an individual basis to determine if there has been a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis of a security to determine whether there is a credit loss associated with the decline in fair value we consider the nature of the collateral potential future changes in collateral values default rates delinquency rates thirdparty guarantees credit ratings interest rate changes since purchase volatility of the securitys fair value and historical loss information for financial assets secured with similar collateral among other factors we use a systematic methodology to determine the acl for investment securities held to maturity the acl is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the held to maturity portfolio we consider the effects of past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts on the collectability of the loan portfolio our estimate of the acl involves a high degree of judgement therefore our process for determining expected credit losses my result in a range of expected credit losses we monitor the held to maturity portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine whether a valuation account needs to be recorded because of changing economic and market conditions affecting issuers we may be required to recognize expected credit losses on securities in future periods which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions technology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions through alternative methods that historically have involved banks for example consumers can now maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts mutual funds or general purpose reloadable prepaid cards consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills andor transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries known as disintermediation could result in the loss of fee income as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits the loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost of deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business as such we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation this is done in part by recruiting hiring and retaining and providing growth opportunities for employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve delivering superior service to our customers and caring about our customers and employees if our reputation is negatively affected by the actions of our employees or otherwise including as a result of a successful cyberattack against us or other unauthorized release or loss of customer information our business and therefore our operating results may be materially adversely affected risks relating to the regulatory environment we are subject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict our activities we operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to examination supervision and comprehensive regulation by various agencies including the federal reserve the occ cfpb and the fdic this regulation is imposed primarily to protect depositors the fdic deposit insurance fund consumers and the banking system as a whole we also are regulated by the sec and the financial industry regulatory authority or finra which regulation is designed to protect investors our compliance with these regulations is costly and potentially restricts certain of our activities including payment of dividends mergers and acquisitions investments loans and interest rates charged interest rates paid and deposits and locations of our offices we are also subject to capital guidelines established by our regulators which require us to maintain sufficient capital to support our growth regulation of the financial services industry has increased significantly since the global financial crisis the laws and regulations applicable to the banking industry could change at any time the extent and timing of any regulatory reform as well as any effect on our business and financial results are uncertain additionally legislation or regulation may impose unexpected or unintended consequences the impact of which is difficult to predict because government regulation greatly affects the business and financial results of all commercial banks and bank holding companies our cost of compliance could adversely affect our ability to operate profitably in addition we expect that the biden administration and the democraticallycontrolled congress will seek to implement a more stringent regulatory agenda that is focused on climate change and fair lending issues this agenda could include a heightened focus on the regulation of loan portfolios and credit concentrations to borrowers impacted by climate change heightened scrutiny on bank secrecy act and antimoney laundering requirements topics related to social equity executive compensation and increased capital and liquidity as well as limits on share buybacks and dividends in addition mergers and acquisitions could be dampened by increased antitrust scrutiny we also expect reform proposals for the shortterm wholesale markets it is too early for us to assess which if any of these policies would be implemented and what their impact on our business financial condition or results of operations would be as the company grows the heightened expectations of regulatory agencies may expose us to additional regulatory risk as the company grows above billion in assets the company will be expected to bolster its risk management and governance framework to support a larger company these expectations include established minimum standards for the design and implementation of the risk management framework and increased oversight and credible challenge by the board of directors over the companys risk profile and risk management practices our existing enterprise risk framework and program may not be easily scalable to meet such heightened expectations thereby requiring lengthy or costly modifications to meet such expectations further the companys existing workforce may not be sufficient or have the requisite skillset to design operate and manage the bolstered framework thereby requiring the company to expend financial resources to hire andor train the necessary staff the companys failure to meet such heightened expectations may expose it to regulatory enforcement actions and civil penalties which could have an adverse material impact on the companys business financial condition operations and reputation and could jeopardize the companys ability to pursue acquisition opportunities we are required to maintain capital to meet regulatory requirements and if we fail to maintain sufficient capital whether due to losses an inability to raise additional capital or otherwise our financial condition liquidity and results of operations as well as our ability to maintain regulatory compliance would be adversely affected the company and the bank each must meet regulatory capital requirements and maintain sufficient liquidity banking organizations experiencing growth especially those making acquisitions are expected to hold additional capital above regulatory minimums from time to time the regulators implement changes to these regulatory capital adequacy guidelines in recent years these market and regulatory expectations have increased substantially and have resulted in higher and more stringent capital requirements for us and the bank for example current capital requirements disallow the companys trust preferred securities from qualifying as tier capital as a result of the company exceeding billion in assets actions if necessary to increase capital may adversely affect us our ability to raise additional capital when and if needed will depend on conditions in the capital markets economic conditions and a number of other factors including investor perceptions regarding the banking industry and market condition and governmental activities many of which are outside our control and on our financial condition and performance accordingly we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us if we fail to meet these capital and other regulatory requirements our financial condition liquidity and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected our failure to remain well capitalized for bank regulatory purposes could affect customer confidence our ability to grow our costs of funds and fdic insurance costs our ability to pay dividends on common stock and make distributions on our trust preferred securities our ability to make acquisitions and our business results of operations and financial condition under fdic rules if our subsidiary bank ceases to be a well capitalized institution for bank regulatory purposes the interest rates that it pays and its ability to accept brokered deposits may be restricted at december we had approximately million in wholesale brokered deposits million of inmarket cdars deposits million of ics deposits and approximately million of deposits related to our prepaid card business which are considered brokered deposits for regulatory purposes we are subject to examination and scrutiny by a number of banking agencies and depending upon the findings and determinations of these agencies we may be required to make adjustments to our business that could adversely affect us the banking agencies regularly conduct examinations of our business including compliance with applicable laws and regulations if as a result of an examination a banking agency were to determine that the financial condition capital resources asset quality asset concentration earning prospects management liquidity sensitivity to market risk consumer compliance or other aspects of any of our operations has become unsatisfactory or that we or our management is in violation of any law or regulation it could take a number or different remedial actions as it deems appropriate these actions include the power to enjoin unsafe or unsound practices to require affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced to direct an increase in our capital to restrict our growth to change the asset composition of our portfolio or balance sheet to assess civil money penalties against our officers or directors to remove officers and directors and if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors to terminate our deposit insurance if we become subject to such regulatory actions our business results of operations and reputation may be negatively impacted the bank is subject to the bank secrecy act and other antimoney laundering statutes and regulations and any deemed deficiency by the bank with respect to these laws could result in significant liability and have material impact on our business strategy the bank secrecy act the usa patriot act of and other laws and regulations require financial institutions among other duties to institute and maintain an effective aml program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports when appropriate the bank is also subject to increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by ofac regarding among other things the prohibition of transacting business with and the need to freeze assets of certain persons and organizations identified as a threat to the national security foreign policy or economy of the united states please see item i part supervision and regulation antimoney laundering rules and item part supervision and regulation ofac regulation for further information regarding the banks obligations under applicable aml laws and regulations and sanctions respectively if the banks policies procedures and systems are deemed deficient or the policies procedures and systems of the financial institutions that we have already acquired or may acquire in the future are deficient the bank could be subject to liability including fines and regulatory actions which may include restrictions on its ability to pay dividends and the necessity and ability to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of its business plan including acquisition plans failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for the bank any of these results could have a material adverse effect on the banks business financial condition results of operations and future prospects the bank is subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers including the community reinvestment act and fair lending laws and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a material penalties and other sanctions the cra the equal credit opportunity act the fair housing act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions the us department of justice and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations a successful regulatory challenge to an institutions performance under the cra or fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions including damages and civil money penalties injunctive relief restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity restrictions on expansion and restrictions on entering new business lines private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institutions performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation such actions could have a material adverse effect on the banks business financial condition results of operations and future prospects higher fdic deposit insurance premiums and assessments could adversely affect our financial condition the fdic insures deposits at fdicinsured depository institutions such as our subsidiary bank up to applicable limits the amount of a particular institutions deposit insurance assessment is based on that institutions risk classification under an fdic riskbased assessment system the assessment base on which the banks deposit insurance premiums is paid to the fdic has been calculated based on its average consolidated total assets less its average equity however effective january which was following the fourth consecutive quarter where the banks total consolidated assets exceeded billion the fdic started to use a performance score and lossseverity score to calculate the banks initial fdic assessment rate an institutions risk classification is assigned based on its capital levels and the level of supervisory concern the institution poses to its regulators while our risk management processes are designed to reduce risk by maintaining capital levels and mitigating any supervisory concerns we may be unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for fdic insurance in the event of a new economic downturn and an increase in financial institution failures any future increases in assessments or required prepayments in fdic insurance premiums may materially adversely affect results of operations including by reducing our profitability or limiting our ability to pursue business opportunities the federal reserve board may require us to commit capital resources to support the bank applicable law and the federal reserve board require a bank holding company to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to a subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank under the source of strength doctrine the federal reserve board may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank under these requirements in the future we could be required to provide financial assistance to our bank if the bank experiences financial distress a capital injection may be required at times when we do not have the resources to provide it and therefore we may be required to borrow the funds in the event of a bank holding companys bankruptcy the bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank moreover bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the holding companys general unsecured creditors including the holders of its note obligations thus any borrowing that must be done by the holding company in order to make the required capital injection becomes more difficult and expensive and will adversely impact the holding companys cash flows financial condition results of operations and prospects we could be subject to changes in tax laws regulations and interpretations or challenges to our income tax provision we compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate any change in enacted tax laws rules or regulatory or judicial interpretations or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could adversely affect our effective tax rate tax payments and results of operations the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our tax positions which could increase our effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations we are subject to audit and review by us federal and state tax authorities any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our financial position and results of operations in addition changes in enacted tax laws such as adoption of a lower income tax rate in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could impact our ability to obtain the future tax benefits represented by our deferred tax assets in addition the determination of our provision for income taxes and other liabilities requires significant judgment by management although we believe that our estimates are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made risks relating to our common stock state law and provisions in our articles of incorporation or bylaws could make it more difficult for another company to purchase us even though such a purchase may increase shareholder value in many cases shareholders may receive a premium for their shares if we were purchased by another company state law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws could make it difficult for anyone to purchase us without the approval of our board of directors our articles of incorporation provide that a merger exchange or consolidation of the company with or the sale exchange or lease of all or substantially all of our assets to any person or entity referred to herein as a fundamental change must be approved by the holders of at least of our outstanding voting stock if the board of directors does not recommend a vote in favor of the fundamental change the articles of incorporation further provide that a fundamental change involving a shareholder that owns or controls or more of our voting stock at the time of the proposed transaction a controlling party must be approved by the holders of at least i of our outstanding voting stock and ii of our outstanding voting stock held by shareholders other than the controlling party unless a the transaction has been recommended to the shareholders by a majority of the entire board of directors or b the consideration per share to be received by our shareholders generally is not less than the highest price per share paid by the controlling party in the acquisition of its holdings of our common stock during the preceding three years the approval by the holders of at least of our outstanding voting stock is required to amend or repeal these provisions contained in our articles of incorporation finally in the event that any such fundamental change is not recommended by the board of directors the holders of at least of our outstanding voting stock must attend a meeting called to address such transaction in person or by proxy in order for a quorum for the conduct of business to exist if the and vote requirements described above do not apply because the board of directors recommends the transaction or the consideration is deemed fair as applicable then pursuant to the provisions of the south carolina business corporation act the fundamental change generally must be approved by two thirds of the votes entitled to be cast with respect thereto consequently a takeover attempt may prove difficult and shareholders may not realize the highest possible price for their securities shares of our common stock are not insured deposits and may lose value shares of our common stock are not savings or deposit accounts and are not insured by the fdic or any other agency or private entity such shares are subject to investment risk including the possible loss of some or all of the value of your investment future capital needs could result in dilution of shareholder investment our board of directors may determine from time to time there is a need to obtain additional capital through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other securities these issuances would dilute the ownership interest of our shareholders and may dilute the per share book value of our common stock new investors also may have rights preferences and privileges senior to our shareholders which may adversely impact our shareholders the trading volume in our common stock and the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could depress the price of our common stock we cannot predict the effect if any that future sales of our common stock in the market or availability of shares of our common stock for sale in the market will have on the market price of our common stock our stock price can fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors general market fluctuations industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events such as terrorist attacks economic slowdowns or recessions interest rate changes tax rate changes credit loss trends or currency fluctuations also could cause our stock price to decrease regardless of operating results we therefore can give no assurance that sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the market or the potential for large amounts of sales in the market or any of the other factors discussed above would not cause the price of our common stock to decline or impair our ability to raise capital through sales of our common stock our ability to pay dividends is limited and we may be unable to pay future dividends our ability to pay dividends is limited by regulatory restrictions and the need to maintain sufficient consolidated capital the ability of the bank to pay dividends to us is limited by its obligations to maintain sufficient capital and by other general restrictions on its dividends that are applicable to national banks that are regulated by the occ for information on these regulatory restrictions on the right of the bank to pay dividends to us and on the right of the company to pay dividends to its shareholders see part i item supervision and regulation dividend restrictions if we do not satisfy these regulatory requirements or if the bank does not have sufficient earnings to make payments to us while maintaining adequate capital levels we will be unable to pay dividends on our common stock holders of our junior subordinated debentures have rights that are senior to those of our common shareholders we have helped support our continued growth through the issuance of and the acquisition of through prior mergers trust preferred securities from special purpose trusts and accompanying junior subordinated debentures the company redeemed million of trust preferred securities in the second and third quarters of and as of december we had outstanding trust preferred securities and accompanying junior subordinated debentures totaling million net of fair value adjustments payments of the principal and interest on these debt instruments are conditionally guaranteed by us further the accompanying junior subordinated debentures we issued to the special purpose trusts are senior to our shares of common stock as a result we must make payments on the junior subordinated debentures before any dividends can be paid on our common stock and in the event of our bankruptcy dissolution or liquidation the holders of the junior subordinated debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made on our common stock we have the right to defer distributions on our junior subordinated debentures and the related trust preferred securities for up to five years during which time no dividends may be paid on our common stock our stock price may be volatile which could result in losses to our investors and litigation against us our stock price has been volatile in the past and several factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future these factors include but are not limited to actual or anticipated variations in earnings changes in analysts recommendations or projections our announcement of developments related to our businesses operations and stock performance of other companies deemed to be peers new technology used or services offered by traditional and nontraditional competitors news reports of trends concerns irrational exuberance on the part of investors and other issues related to the financial services industry our stock price may fluctuate significantly in the future and these fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance general market declines or market volatility in the future especially in the financial institutions sector could adversely affect the price of the companys common stock and the current market price may not be indicative of future market prices stock price volatility may make it more difficult for our investors to resell their common stock when they desire and at prices they find attractive moreover in the past securities class action lawsuits have been instituted against some companies following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities we could in the future be the target of similar litigation securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert managements attention and resources from our normal business at december our shareholders included three funds owning approximately of our common stock and they may exercise significant influence over us and their interests may be different from our other shareholders based on their forms filed for the year end december our shareholders include three funds that collectively own approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock top ten institutional owners collectively own approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock as reported by sp global while the federal banking laws require prior bank regulatory approval if shareholders owning in excess of of a financial holding companys outstanding voting shares desire to act in concert these institutional owners nonetheless could vote the same way on matters submitted to our shareholders without being deemed to be acting in concert and if so could exercise significant influence over us and actions taken by our shareholders interests of institutional funds may be different from our other shareholders accordingly given their collective ownership the funds could have significant influence over whether or not a proposal submitted to our shareholders receives required shareholder approval risks relating to economic conditions and other outside forces the political and economic environment could materially impact our business operations and financial performance the political and economic environment in the united states and elsewhere has resulted in some uncertainty changing regulatory policies because of the changing political environment including the biden administration and democraticallycontrolled congress could be seen as increasing our regulatory and compliance costs or decreases in the amount of expected revenues all of which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results additionally financial markets may be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of military conflict including escalating military tension between russia and ukraine terrorism or other geopolitical events a slowdown in economic growth or a resumption of recessionary economic conditions could have an adverse effect on our business in the future the economic crisis of followed by the covid19 pandemic adversely affected the banking industry as well as financial condition and operating results although economic conditions are improving and growth has been stronger during the second half of future political and market developments could affect consumer confidence levels and cause adverse changes in loan payment patterns causing increases in delinquencies and default rates which may impact our chargeoffs and the provision for credit losses for example changes in international trade policy combined with the outbreak of covid19 continues to disrupt global supply chains and also has led to inflationary pressures on goods and services as well as wages these circumstances could adversely impact our customers and their customers which in turn could impact their ability to make loan payments with the impacts to our business listed above changes in the financial services industry and the effects of current and future law and regulations that may be imposed in response to future market developments also could negatively affect us by restricting our business operations including our ability to originate or sell loans and adversely impact our financial performance the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us our ability to engage in routine funding and other transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships defaults by or even rumors or questions about one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally have led to marketwide liquidity problems and losses of depositor creditor and counterparty confidence and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions we could experience increases in deposits and assets as a result of other banks difficulties or failure which would increase the capital we need to support our growth our business is subject to the success of the local economies where we operate our success significantly depends upon the growth in population income levels deposits and housing starts in our primary and secondary markets if the communities in which we operate do not grow or if prevailing economic conditions locally or nationally become challenging our business may be adversely affected we are less able than a larger institution to spread the risks of unfavorable local economic conditions across a large number of diversified economies we cannot give any assurance we will continue to benefit from market growth or favorable economic conditions in our primary market areas if they do occur adverse weather or manmade events could negatively affect our local economies or disrupt our operations which would have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations our market areas in florida south carolina north carolina georgia virginia and alabama are susceptible to hurricanes tropical storms and related flooding and wind damage as well as tornados and other types of strong storms these type of storms may increase in intensity because of changes in weather patterns and other factors including climate change such weather events and manmade events can disrupt operations result in damage to properties and negatively affect the local economies in the markets where they operate storms during only minimally impacted our operations but we cannot predict whether or to what extent damage that may be caused by future natural disasters or manmade events will affect our operations or the economies in our current or future market areas such events could result in a decline in loan originations a decline in the value or destruction of properties securing our loans as well as our own properties and an increase in delinquencies bankruptcies foreclosures or loan losses that could result in a higher level of nonperforming assets net chargeoffs and provision for loan losses our business or results of operations may be adversely affected by these and other negative effects of future hurricanes tropical storms tornados or other extreme weather events including flooding and wind damage or manmade events many of our customers have incurred significantly higher property and casualty insurance premiums on their properties located in our markets which may adversely affect real estate sales and values in those markets we are subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change and other weather and natural disaster impacts the current and anticipated effects of climate change are creating an increasing level of concern for the state of the global environment as a result political and social attention to the issue of climate change has increased in recent years governments across the world have entered into international agreements to attempt to reduce global temperatures in part by limiting greenhouse gas emissions although the us rejoined the paris agreement effective as of february and the us congress state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies have continued to propose and advance numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives seeking to mitigate the effects of climate change each of which may result in the imposition of taxes and fees the required purchase of emission credits and the implementation of significant operational changes which may require us to expend significant capital and incur compliance operating maintenance and remediation costs given the lack of empirical data on the credit and other financial risks posed by climate change it is impossible to predict how climate change may impact our financial condition and operations however as a banking organization the physical effects of climate change on the bank may present certain unique risks the physical risks of climate change include discrete events such as flooding hurricanes tornadoes and wildfires and longerterm shifts in climate patterns such as extreme heat sea level rise and more frequent and prolonged drought physical risks may alter the companys strategic direction in order to mitigate certain financial risks a significant portion of our operations is located in the areas bordering the gulf of mexico and the atlantic ocean regions that are susceptible to hurricanes or in areas of the southeastern us that are susceptible to tornadoes and other severe weather events including severe droughts floods and sea level rise any of these or any other severe weather event could cause disruption to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our overall business results of operations or financial condition we have taken certain preemptive measures that we believe will mitigate these adverse effects however such measures cannot prevent the disruption that a catastrophic earthquake fire hurricane tornado or other severe weather event could cause to the markets that we serve and any resulting adverse impact on our customers such as hindering our borrowers ability to timely repay their loans diminishing the value of any collateral held by us interrupting supply chains causing significant property damage causing us to incur additional expense or resulting in a loss of revenue and affecting the stability of our deposit base the severity and impact of future earthquakes fires hurricanes tornadoes droughts sea level rise floods and other weatherrelated events are difficult to predict and may be exacerbated by global climate change manmade disasters and other events connected with the gulf of mexico or atlantic ocean such as oil spills could have similar effects such events may also cause reductions in regional and local economic activity that may have an adverse effect on our customers which could limit our ability to raise and invest capital in these areas and communities each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations climate change may worsen the frequency and severity of future earthquakes fires hurricanes tornadoes droughts sea level rise floods and other extreme weatherrelated events that could cause disruption to our business and operations chronic results of climate change such as shifting weather patterns could also cause disruption to our business and operations climate change may also result in new andor more stringent regulatory requirements for the company which could materially affect the companys results of operations by requiring the company to take costly measures to comply with any new laws or regulations related to climate change that may be forthcoming new regulations shift in customer behaviors supply chain collapse or breakthrough technologies that accelerate the transition to a lower carbon economy may negatively affect certain sectors and borrowers in our loan portfolio impacting their ability to timely repay their loans or decreasing the value of any collateral held by us market volatility could adversely affect our operations or ability to access capital the capital and credit markets have experienced volatility and disruption from time to time during the past several years in some cases the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers underlying financial condition or performance if these periodic market disruptions and volatility continue or worsen we may experience adverse effects which may be material on our ability to maintain or access capital and on our business financial condition and results of operations our cost of funds may increase as a result of general economic conditions fdic insurance assessments interest rates and competitive pressures our cost of funds may increase as a result of general economic conditions fdic insurance assessments interest rates and competitive pressures we have traditionally obtained funds principally through local deposits and we have a base of lower cost transaction deposits generally we believe local deposits are a less expensive and more stable source of funds than other borrowings because interest rates paid for local deposits are typically lower than interest rates charged for borrowings from other institutional lenders and reflect a mix of transaction and time deposits whereas brokered deposits typically are higher cost time deposits our costs of funds and our profitability and liquidity are likely to be adversely affected if and to the extent we have to rely upon higher cost borrowings from other institutional lenders or brokers to fund loan demand or liquidity needs and changes in our deposit mix and growth could adversely affect our profitability and the ability to expand our loan portfolio competition from financial institutions and other financial service providers may adversely affect our profitability the banking business is highly competitive and we experience competition in our markets from many other financial institutions we compete with commercial banks credit unions mortgage banking firms consumer finance companies securities brokerage firms insurance companies money market funds and other mutual funds as well as other superregional national and international financial institutions and fintech or ecommerce companies that operate in our primary market areas and elsewhere some of these competitors may have a long history of successful operation in our markets greater ties to local businesses and more expansive banking relationships as well as better established depositor bases competitors with greater resources or more advanced technology may possess an advantage by being capable of maintaining numerous and more convenient banking locations easy to use and available mobile and computer apps or internet platforms operating more atms and conducting extensive promotional and advertising campaigns we compete with these institutions both in attracting deposits and in making loans in addition we have to attract our customer base from other existing financial institutions and from new residents many of our competitors are wellestablished larger financial institutions and credit unions while we believe we can and do successfully compete with these other financial institutions in our primary markets we may face a competitive disadvantage as a result of our smaller size lack of geographic diversification sophisticated online or mobile applications and inability to spread our marketing costs across a broader market although we compete by concentrating our marketing efforts in our primary markets with local advertisements personal contacts and greater flexibility and responsiveness in working with local customers we can give no assurance this strategy will be successful the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our earnings the federal reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the us as its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing and return earned on those loans and investments both of which affect our net interest margin they can also materially decrease the value of financial assets we hold federal reserve policies also can adversely affect borrowers potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans or could result in volatile markets and rapid declining collateral values changes in federal reserve policies are beyond our control and difficult to predict accordingly the impact of these changes on our activities and results of operations is difficult to predict we are or may become involved from time to time in suits legal proceedings informationgathering requests investigations and proceedings by governmental and selfregulatory agencies that may lead to adverse consequences many aspects of the banking business involve a substantial risk of legal liability the company and the bank have been named or threatened to be named as defendants in various lawsuits arising from our business activities and in some cases from the activities of companies that we have acquired in addition from time to time we are or may become the subject of selfregulatory agency informationgathering requests reviews investigations and proceedings and other forms of regulatory inquiry including by bank regulatory agencies the sec and law enforcement authorities the results of such proceedings could lead to significant civil or criminal penalties including monetary penalties damages adverse judgments settlements fines injunctions restrictions on the way the company and the bank conduct their business or reputational harm
