supplemented by acquisitions of select financial institutions or branches in certain market areas the following discussion describes our results of operations for the three and nine months ended september compared to the three and nine months ended september and also analyzes our financial condition as of september as compared to december like most financial institutions we derive most of our income from interest we receive on our loans and investments our primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is our deposits on which we may pay interest consequently one of the key measures of our success is the amount of our net interest income or the difference between the income on our interestearning assets such as loans and investments and the expense on our interestbearing liabilities such as deposits another key measure is the spread between the yield we earn on these interestearning assets and the rate we pay on our interestbearing liabilities of course there are risks inherent in all loans as such we maintain an allowance for credit losses otherwise referred to herein as acl to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible we establish and maintain this allowance by charging a provision for credit losses against our operating earnings in the following discussion we have included a detailed discussion of this process in addition to earning interest on our loans and investments we earn income through fees and other services we charge to our customers we incur costs in addition to interest expense on deposits and other borrowings the largest of which is salaries and employee benefits we describe the various components of this noninterest income and noninterest expense in the following discussion the following sections also identify significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements we encourage you to read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes and the other statistical information also included in this report recent events independent bank group inc independent proposed merger on may southstate and independent announced that the two companies had entered into an agreement and plan of merger dated may merger agreement which provides that upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement independent will merge with and into southstate with southstate continuing as the surviving corporation in the merger immediately following the merger independents whollyowned banking subsidiary independent bank will merge with and into the bank which will continue as the surviving bank in the bank merger the merger agreement was approved by the boards of directors of the company and independent by the unanimous vote of directors present at the applicable meetings and the shareholders of each of southstate and independent the merger agreement is still subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions under the terms of the merger agreement shareholders of independent will receive  of southstates common stock for each share of independent common stock they own the transaction is expected to close during the first quarter of subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions including receipt of required statutory approvals at september independent reported billion in total assets billion in loans and billion in deposits occ merger policy statement the occ adopted a final rule amending its procedures for reviewing applications under the bank merger act bma and adding a policy statement on the occs substantive approach to evaluating bank mergers under the bma the policy statement outlines the general principles the occ will apply when reviewing bank merger applications and clarifies how the occ would consider the statutory factors under the bma the policy statement identifies certain indicators that are more likely to withstand scrutiny and be approved expeditiously and those that would raise supervisory or regulatory concerns indicators generally consistent with timely approval include among others appropriate capital and supervisory ratings lack of enforcement or fair lending actions lack of significant cra or consumer compliance concerns or significant adverse effect on competition and that the resulting institution would have total assets less than billion the final rule becomes effective on january the company is assessing the rule and its possible impact on the companys strategy cfpb open banking rule in october the cfpb finalized a rule to implement section of the doddfrank act which would require certain entities including the company and the bank to among other things make available to a consumer upon request information in its control or possession concerning the consumer financial product or service that the consumer obtained from that entity in general the rule also requires among other things data providers holding a consumer account such as the bank to establish a developer interface satisfying certain data security specifications and other standards through which the data provider can receive requests for and provide specific types of data covered by the rule in electronic usable form to authorized third parties including data aggregators under the rule data providers are prohibited from among other things charging consumers or third parties fees for processing these consumer data requests the rule also places certain data security authorization and other obligations on third parties accessing covered data from data providers which could include the company and the bank when acting in certain capacities the rule requires third parties to limit their collection use and retention of the data received to only what is reasonably necessary to provide the consumers requested product or service the compliance date for a depository institution data provider that holds at least billion in total assets but less than billion in total assets is april however the final rule is subject to ongoing litigation that could impact whether and when the company and the bank are required to comply with the rule we continue to evaluate the final rule and the potential impacts on the company and the bank critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies in accordance with gaap and follow general practices within the banking industry our financial position and results of operations are affected by managements application of accounting policies including estimates assumptions and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and expenses differences in the application of these policies could result in material changes in our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations and related disclosures understanding our accounting policies is fundamental to understanding our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations accordingly our significant accounting policies and changes in accounting principles and effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in note summary of significant accounting policies and note recent accounting and regulatory pronouncements of our consolidated financial statements in this quarterly report on form 10q and in note summary of significant accounting policies of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december the following is a summary of our allowance for credit losses acl critical accounting policy which is highly dependent on estimates assumptions and judgments allowance for credit losses acl the acl reflects managements estimate of the portion of the amortized cost of loans and unfunded commitments that it does not expect to collect management has a methodology determining its acl for loans held for investment and certain offbalancesheet credit exposures management considers the effects of past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts on the collectability of the loan portfolio the companys estimate of its acl involves a high degree of judgment therefore managements process for determining expected credit losses may result in a range of expected credit losses it is possible that others given the same information may at any point in time reach a different reasonable conclusion the companys acl recorded on the balance sheet reflects managements best estimate within the range of expected credit losses the company recognizes in net income the amount needed to adjust the acl for managements current estimate of expected credit losses see note 2summary of significant accounting policies for further detailed descriptions of our estimation process and methodology related to the acl see also note 7allowance for credit losses and allowance for credit losses acl on loans and certain offbalancesheet credit exposures in this mda one of the most significant judgments influencing the acl is the macroeconomic forecasts from the thirdparty service provider changes in the economic forecasts may significantly affect the estimated credit losses which may potentially lead to materially different quantitatively modeled allowance levels from one reporting period to the next given the dynamic relationship between macroeconomic variables it is difficult to estimate the impact of a change in any one individual variable on the acl southstate uses a thirdparty service provider to support the economic forecast assumptions under cecl forecast by providing various levels of economic scenarios these scenarios are weighted in accordance with management assessment of scenarios as well as expectations of the general market and industry conditions to illustrate the sensitivity of these scenarios if a probability weighting was applied to the adverse scenario rather than using the probabilityweighted three scenario approach this would result in an increase in the acl by approximately million all other things equal including no compensating adjustments to qualitative factor adjustments conversely if a probability weighting was applied to the upside scenario this would result in a decrease in the acl by approximately million the adverse scenario includes assumptions including but not limited to elevated interest rates weakening consumers and public confidence inflation the conflict in the middle east leading to a wider war tensions between china and taiwan interrupt trade political risks increased unemployment and the us economy falling into recession in conversely the upside scenario includes assumptions such as a swift resolution of international conflicts stabilization of consumer confidence more than full employment reduced political tensions and other favorable assumptions this sensitivity analysis and related impact on the acl is a hypothetical analysis and is not intended to represent managements judgments or assumptions of qualitative loss factors that were utilized at september results of operations overview we reported consolidated net income of million or diluted earnings per share eps of for the third quarter of as compared to consolidated net income of million or diluted eps of in the comparable period of a increase in consolidated net income and a increase in diluted eps during the nine months ended september we reported consolidated net income of million or diluted eps of as compared to consolidated net income of million or diluted eps of in the comparable period of a increase in consolidated net income and a increase in diluted eps the million increase in consolidated net income for the third quarter of compared to the same period of was the net result of the following items a million increase in interest income resulting from a million increase in interest income from loans and loans held for sale partially offset by a million decrease in interest income from investment securities and a million decrease in interest income on federal funds sold securities purchased under agreement to resell and interestbearing deposits the increase in interest income from loans was due to an increase in the yield of basis points as loans continued to reprice higher from the comparatively higher rate environment in and in the federal reserve bank decreased its federal funds rate by basis points for the first time since early however the rate cut took place in midseptember the increase in interest income in loans was also due to an increase in the average balance of billion mainly through organic growth of loans held for investment the decline in interest income from investment securities and federal funds sold securities purchased under agreement to resell and interestbearing deposits was mainly due to the decline in average balance of million and million respectively a million increase in interest expense which mainly resulted from a million increase in interest expense from deposits a million increase in interest expense in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase and million increase in interest in other borrowings the increase in interest expense from deposits resulted from an increase in costs due to deposits repricing in the higher interest rate environment along with growth in higher costing money market and time deposits since the third quarter of the average cost of deposits excluding noninterestbearing deposits increased by basis points compared to the third quarter of a million decrease in the provision for credit losses as the company released provision for credit losses of million in the third quarter of while recording a provision for credit losses of million in the third quarter of during the third quarter of we released provision for credit losses mainly due to a decline in unfunded commitments leading to a release of provision of million the provision for credit losses also declined due to lower net loan growth in the third quarter of compared to the same period in as well as improvement in economic forecasts with inflation falling and interest rates beginning to decline in the third quarter of a million increase in noninterest income due to an increase in trust and investment services income of million an increase in bank owned life insurance of million and an increase in fees on deposit accounts of million these increases were offset by a decline in correspondent banking and capital market income of million see noninterest income section on page for further discussion an million increase in noninterest expense which resulted primarily from an increase in salaries and employee benefits of million in merger branch consolidation severance related and other expense of million and an information services expense of million these increases were partially offset by declines in fdic assessment and other regulatory charges of million and amortization of intangibles of million see noninterest expense section on page for further discussion and higher income tax provision of million due to higher pretax book income between the two quarters the company recorded pretax book income of million in the third quarter of compared to pretax book income of million in the third quarter of the increase was also due to the effects of the company adopting asu in the first quarter of whereby it applied the proportional amortization method of accounting related to its lowincome housing tax credits partnerships lihtc with the adoption of asu the amortization of the lihtcs is now recorded within provision for income taxes rather than other noninterest expense on the statement of income the amortization for the companys lihtcs totaled million during the third quarter of the change in the accounting method in addition to other items recorded during the current quarter increased our effective tax rate for the third quarter in

discussion our quarterly efficiency ratio increased to in the third quarter of compared to in the third quarter of the increase in the efficiency ratio compared to the third quarter of was the result of a decrease in the total of taxequivalent net interest income and noninterest income along with a increase in noninterest expense excluding amortization of intangibles this decrease was reflective of a increase in interest expense as the repricing of interestbearing liabilities caught up with the repricing of interestearning assets in and resulting from the rising rate environment the increase in noninterest expense was reflective of a increase in salaries and employee benefits an increase in information services expense and a increase in merger and branch consolidation related expense mostly related to the proposed merger with independent basic and diluted eps were and respectively for the third quarter of compared to and respectively for the third quarter of the increase in basic and diluted eps was due to a increase in net income in the third quarter of compared to the same period in the effects from the increase in net income were partially offset by an increase in average

interest rate cycle prior to the recent rate cut and has caught up in the latter half of and into o nonte yield on interestearning assets for the third quarter of increased basis points to from the comparable period in due to higher yields on the majority of interestearning assets including loans held for investment investments securities and loans held for sale as the federal reserve bank interest rate hikes during and a majority of the first nine months of continue to impact these rates yields on loans held for sale increased due to new small business administration sba loan purchases that generally earn higher yields compared to mortgage loans the interest rate impact in combination with the increases in the average balance of the higher yielding loan held for investment portfolio of billion and the decline in the average balances of lower yielding investment securities of million affected the overall yield increase between the comparable periods o the average cost of interestbearing liabilities for the third quarter of increased basis points from the same period in this increase was driven by the effects from the relatively higher rate environment on the repricing of all deposit accounts federal funds purchased securities purchased with agreement to repurchase and trust preferred corporate debt the average cost of interestbearing deposits increased basis points as the cost increase occurred across all deposit categories as a result of the comparatively higher rate environment and a change in the deposit mix our deposits have shifted from lowercosting savings

see note summary of significant accounting policies under the acl loans section of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december and note significant accounting policies in this quarterly report on form 10q for further detailed descriptions of our estimation process and methodology related to the acl on loans management considers forwardlooking information in estimating expected credit losses the company subscribes to a thirdparty service which provides a quarterly macroeconomic baseline outlook and alternative scenarios for the united states economy the baseline along with the evaluation of alternative scenarios is used by management to determine the best estimate within the range of expected credit losses management evaluates the appropriateness of the reasonable and supportable forecast scenarios and takes into consideration the scenarios in relation to actual economic and other data such as gross domestic product growth monetary and fiscal policy inflation supply chain issues and global events like the russianukraine conflict and unrest in middle east as well as the volatility and magnitude of changes within those scenarios quarter over quarter and consideration of conditions within the banks operating environment and geographic area additional forecast scenarios may be weighted along with the baseline forecast to arrive at the final reserve estimate while periods of relative economic stability should generally lead to stability in forecast scenarios and weightings to estimate credit losses periods of instability can likewise require management to adjust the selection of scenarios and weightings in accordance with the accounting standards for the contractual term that extends beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period the company reverts to the long term mean of historical factors within four quarters using a straightline approach the company generally uses an eightquarter forecast and a fourquarter reversion period in spite of the rapid interest rate hikes experienced cycletodate the us has thus far avoided a recession although an inverted yield curve such as observed in the current interest rate environment often portends a coming recession management continues to use a blended forecast scenario of the baseline upside and more severe scenario depending on the circumstances and economic outlook for the quarter ending september as well as the prior quarter management selected a baseline weighting of a weighting for an upside scenario and a weighting for the more severe scenario the scenario weightings were unchanged from the prior quarter scenario weightings are generally expected to remain stable but are reviewed on a quarterly basis the scenario weightings reflect continued recognition of downside risks in the economic forecast from persistent levels of inflation high interest rates and tightening credit conditions conducive of a mild recession while employment figures still show resilience and actual loan losses remain at low levels continued projected borrower weakness related to high interest rates uncertainty and lingering chances of an economic downturn continue to moderate optimism in the path of the forecast and kept expected losses mostly flat a decrease in unfunded commitments primarily in commercial construction drove a provision release of

throughout and resulting in increases in deposit rates to retain local deposits the bank supplements its inmarket deposits with brokered deposits while the bank has a policy limit for brokered time deposits of no more than of total deposits it has operated well below this policy limit at september the percentage of brokered time deposits to total deposits was compared to at december during the third quarter of the company also borrowed funds from the fhlb on a shortterm basis of million the outstanding borrowings from the fhlb were million at december see below for further discussion around brokered deposits and fhlb borrowings our ongoing philosophy is to remain in a liquid position as reflected by such indicators as the composition of our earning assets typically including some level of reverse repurchase agreements federal funds sold balances at the federal reserve bank andor other shortterm investments asset quality wellcapitalized position and profitable operating results cyclical and other economic trends and conditions can disrupt our desired liquidity position at any time we expect that these conditions would generally be of a shortterm nature under such circumstances we expect our reverse repurchase agreements and federal funds sold positions or balances at the federal reserve bank if any to serve as the primary source of immediate liquidity we could draw on additional alternative immediate funding sources from lines of credit extended to us from our correspondent banks the bank may also access funds from borrowing facilities established with the federal home loan bank of atlanta and the discount window of the federal reserve bank of atlanta deposit flows are significantly influenced by general and local economic conditions changes in prevailing interest rates internal pricing decisions and competition our deposits are primarily obtained from depositors located around our branch footprint and we believe that we have attractive opportunities to capture additional retail and commercial deposits in our markets in addition to having access to brokered deposits of the billion in total deposits at september approximately were insured or collateralized the bank has a granular deposit base comprised of over million accounts with an average deposit size of the top ten and twenty deposit relationships comprise approximately and of total deposits respectively and approximately of total deposits are noninterest bearing at september and december we had billion and million of traditional outofmarket brokered time deposits respectively at september and december we had billion and billion respectively of reciprocal deposits total deposits were billion at september an increase of million from billion at december this change in deposits from december was driven by an increase in money market accounts of billion including million in reciprocal insured money market deposits and in time deposits of million this increase was partially offset by declines in interestbearing checking accounts of million and savings deposits of million as customers moved funds from noninterestbearing deposits interestbearing checking and savings accounts seeking higher yields in the rising rate environment the company has seen an increase in its balance of higher yielding money market accounts and time deposits during the company raised interest rates on most interestbearing deposit products in particular money market accounts and time deposit specials due to competitive pressures to retain deposits total shortterm borrowings at september were million consisting of million in federal funds purchased and million in securities sold under agreements to repurchase the company also held million in short term daily rate fhlb advances at september total longterm borrowing at september were million and consisted of trust preferred securities and subordinated debentures to the extent that we employ other types of nondeposit funding sources typically to accommodate retail and correspondent customers we continue to take in shorter maturities of such funds our current approach may provide an opportunity to sustain a low funding rate or possibly lower our cost of funds but could also increase our cost of funds if interest rates rise in addition to deposits we have other primary contingency funding sources available to the bank at september our bank had a total fhlb credit facility of billion with million in fhlb advance outstanding and million in fhlb letters of credit outstanding at quarterend leaving billion in availability on the fhlb credit facility in addition our bank had billion of credit available at the federal reserve banks discount window and had billion in market value of unpledged securities at september that can be pledged to obtain additional funds if necessary all of these resources provide billion of additional funding for the bank as discussed previously and presented below the table below compares primary funding sources to uninsured deposits as of september  in millions available capacity federal home loan bank of atlanta federal reserve bank of atlanta discount window cash and cash equivalents fair value of securities that can be pledged total primary sources uninsured deposits excluding collateralized deposits uninsured and collateralized deposits coverage ratio uninsured deposits coverage ratio uninsured and collateralized deposits ratio of uninsured and collateralized deposits to total deposits the bank also has an internal limit on brokered deposits of of total deposits which would allow capacity of billion as of september the bank had billion of outstanding brokered deposits at the end of the quarter leaving billion in available capacity the bank has federal funds credit lines of million with no balances outstanding at quarterend and the holding company has a million unsecured line of credit with us bank national association with no balance outstanding at september we believe that our liquidity position continues to be adequate and readily available in addition to adequate liquidity the company and bank are considered well capitalized by all regulatory capital standards as the company and the bank were significantly above the required capital levels as of september the companys tier leverage ratio cet riskbased capital ratio and total riskbased capital ratio were and respectively at september the banks tier leverage ratio cet riskbased capital ratio and total riskbased capital ratio were and respectively at september as permitted we elected to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income related to available for sale securities from tier cet and total riskbased capital however even if our unrealized losses as of september in our available for sale and held to maturity investment portfolios were recognized by selling the portfolios for liquidity purposes all else being equal our regulatory capital ratios would remain well in excess of the minimum standards and continue to be in the well capitalized regulatory classification assetliability management and market risk sensitivity our earnings and the economic value of equity vary in relation to the behavior of interest rates and the accompanying fluctuations in market prices of certain of our financial instruments we define interest rate risk as the risk to earnings and equity arising from the behavior of interest rates these behaviors include increases and decreases in interest rates as well as continuation of the current interest rate environment our interest rate risk principally consists of reprice option basis and yield curve risk reprice risk results from differences in the maturity or repricing characteristics of asset and liability portfolios option risk arises from embedded options in the investment and loan portfolios such as investment securities calls and loan prepayment options option risk also exists since deposit customers may withdraw funds at their discretion in response to general market conditions competitive alternatives to existing accounts or other factors the exercise of such options may result in higher costs or lower revenue basis risk refers to the potential for changes in the underlying relationship between market rates or indices which subsequently result in narrowing spreads on interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities basis risk also exists in administered rate liabilities such as interestbearing checking accounts savings accounts and money market accounts where the price sensitivity of such products may vary relative to general markets rates yield curve risk refers to adverse consequences of nonparallel shifts in the yield curves of various market indices that impact our assets and liabilities we use simulation analysis as a primary method to assess earnings at risk and equity at risk due to assumed changes in interest rates management uses the results of its various simulation analyses in combination with other data and observations to formulate strategies designed to maintain interest rate risk within risk tolerances simulation analysis involves the use of several assumptions including but not limited to the timing of cash flows such as the terms of contractual agreements investment security calls loan prepayment speeds deposit attrition rates the interest rate sensitivity of loans and deposits relative to general market rates and the behavior of interest rates and spreads the assumptions for loan prepayments deposit decay and nonstable deposit balances are derived from models that use historical bank data these models are independently validated equity at risk simulation uses assumptions regarding discount rates that value cash flows simulation analysis is highly dependent on model assumptions that may vary from actual outcomes key simulation assumptions are subject to sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of assumption changes on earnings at risk and equity at risk model assumptions are reviewed by our assumptions committee while the bank is continuously refining its modeling methodology the core principles of the methodology have remained stable over for several years earnings at risk is defined as the percentage change in net interest income due to assumed changes in interest rates earnings at risk is generally used to assess interest rate risk over relatively short time horizons equity at risk is defined as the percentage change in the net economic value of assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates compared to a base net economic value the discounted present value of all cash flows represents our economic value of equity equity at risk is generally considered a measure of the longterm interest rate exposures of the balance sheet at a point in time the earnings simulation models consider our contractual agreements with regard to investments loans deposits borrowings and derivatives as well as a number of behavioral assumptions applied to certain assets and liabilities mortgage banking derivatives used in the ordinary course of business consist of forward sales contracts and interest rate lock commitments on residential mortgage loans these derivatives involve underlying items such as interest rates and are designed to mitigate risk derivatives are also used to hedge mortgage servicing rights for additional information see note derivative financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements from time to time we execute interest rate swaps to hedge some of our interest rate risks under these arrangements the company enters into a variable rate loan with a client in addition to a swap agreement the swap agreement effectively converts the clients variable rate loan into a fixed rate loan the company then enters into a matching swap agreement with a thirdparty dealer to offset its exposure on the customer swap the company may also execute interest rate swap agreements that are not specific to client loans as of september the company had a series of shortterm interest rate hedges to address monthly accrual mismatches related to the companys arc program and its transition from libor to sofr after june for additional information on these derivatives refer to note derivative financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements our interest rate risk key indicators are applied to a static balance sheet using forward rates from the moodys baseline scenario the company will also use other rate forecasts including but not limited to moodys consensus scenario this base case scenario assumes the maturity composition of asset and liability rollover volumes is modeled to approximately replicate current consolidated balance sheet characteristics throughout the simulation these treatments are consistent with the companys goal of assessing current interest rate risk embedded in its current balance sheet the base case scenario assumes that maturing or repricing assets and liabilities are replaced at prices referencing forward rates derived from the selected rate forecast consistent with current balance sheet pricing characteristics key rate drivers are used to price assets and liabilities with sensitivity assumptions used to price nonmaturity deposits the sensitivity assumptions for the pricing of nonmaturity deposits are subjected to sensitivity analysis no less frequently than on an annual basis interest rate shocks are applied to the base case on an instantaneous basis our policy establishes the use of upward and downward interest rate shocks applied in basis point increments through basis points we calculate smaller rate shocks as needed at times market conditions may result in assumed rate movements that will be deemphasized for example during a period of ultralow interest rates certain downward rate shocks may be impractical the model simulation results produced from the base case scenario and related instantaneous shocks for changes in net interest income and changes in the economic value of equity are referred to as the core scenario analysis and constitute the policy key risk indicators for interest rate risk when compared to risk tolerances as of september the company was operating within its interest rate key risk indicator policy limits during and for the nine months ended september the beta assumption applied to total deposits increased to reflect changes in deposit mix from the beginning of the upward rate cycle our deposit costs have increased from five basis points to one hundred and ninety basis points during this period the federal funds rate has increased basis points accordingly our cycle to date beta has been approximately management recognizes the difficulty in using historical data to forecast deposit betas in the current environment for internal purposes and based on the deposit mix as of september the total deposit beta assumption was for internal forecasting management will apply overlays to certain assumptions to adjust for current market conditions rather than use assumptions modeled over longer periods of time the following interest rate risk metrics are derived from analysis using the moodys baseline scenario published in october as the base case scenario as of september the earnings simulations indicated that the year impact of an instantaneous basis point parallel increase decrease in rates would result in an estimated increase up and decrease down in net interest income we use economic value of equity eve analysis as an indicator of the extent to which the present value of our capital could change given potential changes in interest rates this measure also assumes a static balance sheet base case scenario with rate shocks applied as described above at september the percentage change in eve due to a 100basis point increase or decrease in interest rates was decrease and increase respectively the percentage changes in eve due to a 200basis point increase or decrease in interest rates were decrease and decrease respectively downward shocks are constrained on various balance sheet categories due to the inability to price products below floors or zero this is particularly meaningful given the cost of deposits as of september the analysis below reflects a base case and shocked scenarios that assume a static balance sheet projection where volume is added to maintain balances consistent with current levels base case assumes new and repricing volumes reference forward rates derived from the moodys baseline rate forecast instantaneous parallel and sustained interest rate shocks are applied to the base case scenario over a oneyear time horizon percentage change in net interest income over one year up basis points down basis points down basis points down basis points down basis points deposit concentrations as of september and december we have no material concentration of deposits from any single customer or group of customers we have no significant portion of our deposits concentrated within a single industry or group of related industries we do not believe there are any material seasonal factors that would have a material adverse effect on us the total deposit balances held by top ten and deposit holders were below of the companys average total deposit balances at september we do not have any foreign deposits concentration of credit risk each category of earning assets has a certain degree of credit risk we use various techniques to measure credit risk credit risk in the investment portfolio can be measured through bond ratings published by independent agencies in the investment securities portfolio the investments consist of us governmentsponsored entity securities taxfree securities or other securities having ratings of aaa to not rated all securities with the exception of those that are not rated were rated by at least one of the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations the credit risk of the loan portfolio can be measured by historical experience we maintain our loan portfolio in accordance with credit policies that we have established although the bank has a diversified loan portfolio a substantial portion of our borrowers abilities to honor their contracts is dependent upon economic conditions within our geographic footprint and the surrounding regions we consider concentrations of credit to exist when pursuant to regulatory guidelines the amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar business activities which would cause them to be similarly impacted by general economic conditions represents of total tier capital plus regulatory adjusted allowance for credit losses of the company or billion at september based on this criteria we had seven such credit concentrations at september including loans to lessors of nonresidential buildings except miniwarehouses of billion loans secured by owneroccupied office buildings including medical office buildings of billion loans secured by owneroccupied nonresidential buildings excluding office buildings of billion loans to lessors of residential buildings investment properties and multifamily of billion loans secured by 1st mortgage family owneroccupied residential property including condos and home equity lines of billion loans secured by jumbo original loans greater than of billion and loans secured by business assets including accounts receivable inventory and equipment of billion the risk for these loans and for all loans is managed collectively through the use of credit underwriting practices developed and updated over time the loss estimate for these loans is determined using our standard acl methodology after the adoption of cecl in the first quarter of banking regulators established guidelines for calculating credit concentrations banking regulators set the guidelines for construction land development and other land loans to total less than of total tier capital less modified cecl transitional amount plus acl cdl concentration ratio and for total commercial real estate loans construction land development and other land loans along with other nonowneroccupied commercial real estate and multifamily loans to total less than of total tier capital less modified cecl transitional amount plus acl cre concentration ratio both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by the banks total tier capital less modified cecl transitional amount plus acl at september and december the banks cdl concentration ratio was and respectively and its cre concentration ratio was and respectively as of september the bank was below the established regulatory guidelines when a banks ratios are in excess of one or both of these loan concentration ratios guidelines banking regulators generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by bank management therefore we monitor these two ratios as part of our concentration management processes r econciliation of gaap to nongaap the return on average tangible equity is a nongaap
