item risk factors our business operations and the value of our securities may be adversely affected by certain risk factors many of which are outside of our control we believe the risk factors listed could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations we may also be adversely affected by additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that we currently believe are immaterial to our business operations if any of such risks actually occur you could lose part or all of your investment this report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors further to the extent that any of the information contained in this report constitutes a forwardlooking statement the risk factors below also are cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements see the section captioned forwardlooking statements in part ii item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report general business risks our business may be adversely affected by economic conditions our financial performance generally and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans as well as demand for loans and other products and services we offer and whose success we rely on to drive our growth is highly dependent upon the business environment in the primary markets where we operate and in the united states as a whole unlike larger banks that are more geographically diversified we are a regional bank that provides banking and financial services to customers primarily in south carolina charlotte and wilmington north carolina northeast georgia augusta georgia savannah georgia and richmond virginia the economic conditions in these local markets may be different from and in some instances worse than the economic conditions in the united states as a whole some elements of the business environment that affect our financial performance include shortterm and longterm interest rates the prevailing yield curve inflation and price levels monetary and trade policy unemployment and the strength of the domestic economy and the local economy in the markets in which we operate unfavorable market conditions can result in a deterioration in the credit quality of our borrowers and the demand for our products and services an increase in the number of loan delinquencies defaults and chargeoffs additional provisions for loan losses adverse asset values of the collateral securing our loans and an overall material adverse effect on the quality of our loan portfolio unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth business activity or investor or business confidence limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital increases in inflation or interest rates high unemployment natural disasters epidemics or pandemics or a combination of these or other factors during the us economy has continued to grow across a wide range of industries and regions in the united states however there are continuing concerns related to among other things the level of us government debt and fiscal actions that may be taken to address that debt the potential effects of coronavirus on international trade including supply chains and export levels travel employee productivity and other economic activities depressed oil prices and the uschina trade disputes and related tariffs that may have a destabilizing effect on financial markets and economic activity there can be no assurance that current economic conditions will continue or improve and economic conditions could worsen economic pressure on consumers and uncertainty regarding continuing economic improvement may result in changes in consumer and business spending borrowing and saving habits a return of recessionary conditions andor other negative developments in the domestic or international credit markets may significantly affect the markets in which we do business the value of our loans and investments and our ongoing operations costs and profitability declines in real estate value and sales volumes and high unemployment may also result in higher than expected loan delinquencies and a decline in demand for our products and services these negative events may cause us to incur losses and may adversely affect our capital liquidity and financial condition our estimated allowance for loan losses and fair value adjustments with respect to loans acquired in our acquisitions may prove to be insufficient to absorb actual losses in our loan portfolio which may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we are exposed to the risk that our customers will be unable to repay their loans according to their terms and that any collateral securing the payment of their loans will not be sufficient to ensure full repayment credit losses are inherent in the lending business and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and ability to meet our obligations volatility and deterioration in domestic markets may also increase our risk for credit losses the composition of our loan portfolio which is primarily secured by real estate reduces loss exposure at december we had approximately loans secured by real estate with an average loan balance of approximately at december we had approximately total loans with an average loan balance of approximately we evaluate the collectability of our loan portfolio and we maintain an allowance for loan losses that represents managements judgment of probable losses and risks inherent in our loan portfolio that we believe to be adequate based on a variety of factors including but not limited to the risk characteristics of various classifications of loans previous loan loss experience specific loans that have loss potential delinquency trends estimated fair market value of the collateral current economic conditions the views of our regulators and geographic and industry loan concentrations if our evaluation is incorrect and defaults by borrowers lead to loan losses that exceed our allowance for loan losses our earnings could be significantly and adversely affected no assurance can be given that the allowance will be adequate to cover loan losses inherent in our portfolio we may experience losses in our loan portfolio or perceive adverse conditions and trends that may require us to significantly increase our allowance for loan losses in the future a decision that would reduce earnings the application of the purchase method of accounting in our acquisitions and any future acquisitions will impact our allowance for loan losses under the purchase method of accounting all acquired loans were recorded in our consolidated financial statements at their estimated fair value at the time of acquisition and any related allowance for loan loss was eliminated because credit quality among other factors was considered in the determination of fair value to the extent that our estimates of fair value are too high we will incur losses associated with the acquired loans the allowance associated with our purchased credit impaired loans reflects deterioration in cash flows since acquisition resulting from our quarterly reestimation of cash flows which involves complex cash flow projections and significant judgment on timing of loan resolution in addition our regulators as an integral part of their periodic examination review our methodology for calculating and the adequacy of our allowance and provision for loan losses although we believe that the methodology used by us to determine the amount of both the allowance for loan losses and provision is effective the regulators or our auditor may conclude that changes are necessary based on information available to them at the time of their review which could impact our overall credit portfolio such changes could result in among other things modifications to our methodology for determining our allowance or provision for loan losses or models reclassification or downgrades of our loans increases in our allowance for loan losses or other credit costs imposition of new or more stringent concentration limits restrictions in our lending activities andor recognition of further losses further if actual chargeoffs in future periods exceed the amounts allocated to the allowance for loan losses we may need additional provisions for loan losses to restore the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses new accounting standards could require us to increase our allowance for loan losses and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations the measure of our allowance for loan losses is dependent on the adoption and interpretation of accounting standards the financial accounting standards board has issued a new credit impairment model the current expected credit loss or cecl standard which will become effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december effective for the calendar year beginning january under the cecl model we will be required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost such as loans held for investment and heldtomaturity debt securities at the net amount expected to be collected the measurement of expected credit losses is to be based on information about past events including historical experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount and certain management judgements over the life of the loan this initial measurement will take place january at the time of adoption and periodically thereafter accordingly we expect that the adoption of the cecl model will materially affect how we determine our allowance for loan losses and could require us to significantly increase our allowance moreover the cecl model may create more volatility in the level of our allowance for loan losses if we are required to materially increase our level of allowance for loan losses for any reason such increase could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations a significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate and events that negatively impact the real estate market could hurt our business a significant portion of our nonacquired and acquired noncredit impaired loan portfolios are secured by real estate as of december approximately of such loans had real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral the real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended while economic conditions and real estate in our primary markets of south carolina north carolina georgia and virginia have continued to improve there can be no assurance that our local markets will not experience another economic decline deterioration in the real estate market could cause us to adjust our opinion of the level of credit quality in our loan portfolio such a determination may lead to an additional increase in our provisions for loan losses which could also adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations if we fail to effectively manage credit risk and interest rate risk our business and financial condition will suffer we must effectively manage credit risk there are risks inherent in making any loan including risks with respect to the period of time over which the loan may be repaid risks relating to proper loan underwriting and guidelines risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers and risks resulting from uncertainties as to the future value of collateral there is no assurance that our credit risk monitoring and loan approval procedures are or will be adequate or will reduce the inherent risks associated with lending our credit administration personnel policies and procedures may not adequately adapt to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting customers and the quality of our loan portfolio any failure to manage such credit risks may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we must also effectively manage interest rate risk because mortgage loans typically have much longer maturities than deposits or other types of funding rising interest rates can raise the cost of funding relative to the value of the mortgage loan we manage this risk in part by holding adjustable rate mortgages in portfolios and through other means conversely the value of our mortgage servicing assets may fall when interest rates fall as borrowers refinance into lower rate loans given current rates material reductions in rates may not be probable but as rates rise then the risk increases there can be no assurance that we will successfully manage the lending and servicing businesses through all future interestrate environments changes in us trade policies and other factors beyond our control including the imposition of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs may adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations there have been changes and discussions with respect to us trade policies legislation treaties and tariffs including trade policies and tariffs affecting other countries including china the european union canada and mexico and retaliatory tariffs by such countries tariffs and retaliatory tariffs have been imposed and additional tariffs and retaliation tariffs have been proposed such tariffs retaliatory tariffs or other trade restrictions on products and materials that our customers import or export could cause the prices of our customers products to increase which could reduce demand for such products or reduce our customer margins and adversely impact their revenues financial results and ability to service debt which in turn could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in addition to the extent changes in the political environment have a negative impact on us or on the markets in which we operate our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted in the future it remains unclear what the us administration or foreign governments will or will not do with respect to tariffs already imposed additional tariffs that may be imposed or international trade agreements and policies on january president trump signed a new trade deal between the united states canada and mexico to replace the north american free trade agreement the full impact of this agreement on us our customers and on the economic conditions in our primary banking markets is currently unknown a trade war or other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies has the potential to negatively impact ours andor our customers costs demand for our customers products andor the us economy or certain sectors thereof and thus adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we are exposed to higher credit risk by commercial real estate commercial business and construction lending commercial real estate commercial business and construction lending usually involves higher credit risks than that of single family residential lending at december the following loan types accounted for the stated percentages of our total loan portfolio commercial real estate owner and nonowner occupied commercial and industrial business and construction and land development lending these types of loans involve larger loan balances to a single borrower or groups of related borrowers commercial real estate loans may be affected to a greater extent than residential loans by adverse conditions in real estate markets or the economy because commercial real estate borrowers ability to repay their loans depends in some cases on successful development of their properties as well as the factors affecting residential real estate borrowers these loans may involve greater risk because they generally are not fully amortizing over the loan period but have a balloon payment due at maturity a borrowers ability to make a balloon payment typically will depend on being able to either refinance the loan or sell the underlying property in a timely manner commercial and industrial business loans are typically based on the borrowers ability to repay the loans from the cash flow of their businesses which may be unpredictable and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value although commercial and industrial business loans are often collateralized by equipment inventory accounts receivable or other business assets the liquidation of collateral in the event of default is often an insufficient source of repayment because accounts receivable may be uncollectible and inventories may be obsolete or of limited use in addition business assets may depreciate over time may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business accordingly the repayment of commercial business loans depends primarily on the cash flow and credit worthiness of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral value provided by the borrower and liquidity of the guarantor risk of loss on a construction and land development loans depends largely upon whether our initial estimate of the propertys value at completion of construction exceeds the cost of the property construction including interest and the availability of permanent takeout financing during the construction phase a number of factors can result in delays and cost overruns if estimates of value are inaccurate or if actual construction costs exceed estimates the value of the property securing the loan may be insufficient to ensure full repayment when completed through a permanent loan or by seizure of collateral commercial real estate commercial business and construction loans are more susceptible to a risk of loss during a downturn in the business cycle our underwriting review and monitoring cannot eliminate all of the risks related to these loans as of december our commercial real estate loans were equal to of our total riskbased capital the banking regulators are giving commercial real estate lending greater scrutiny and may require banks with higher levels of commercial real estate loans to implement enhanced underwriting internal controls risk management policies and portfolio stress testing as well as possibly higher levels of allowances for losses and capital levels as a result of commercial real estate lending growth and exposures liquidity needs could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition our primary source of funds are client deposits and loan repayments while scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds they are subject to the ability of borrowers to repay the loans the ability of borrowers to repay loans can be adversely affected by a number of factors including changes in economic conditions adverse trends or events affecting business industry groups reductions in real estate values or markets business closings or layoffs inclement weather natural disasters which could be exacerbated by potential climate change and international instability additionally deposit levels may be affected by a number of factors including rates paid by competitors general interest rate levels regulatory capital requirements returns available to clients on alternative investments and general economic conditions accordingly we may be required from time to time to rely on secondary sources of liquidity to meet withdrawal demands or otherwise fund operations such sources include federal home loan bank advances sales of securities and loans and federal funds lines of credit from correspondent banks as well as outofmarket time deposits while we believe that these sources are currently adequate there can be no assurance they will be sufficient to meet future liquidity demands particularly if we continue to grow and experience increasing loan demand we may be required to slow or discontinue loan growth capital expenditures or other investments or liquidate assets should such sources not be adequate we may be adversely affected by risks associated with future mergers and acquisitions including execution risk which could disrupt our business and dilute shareholder value in accordance with our strategic plan we evaluate opportunities to acquire other banks and branch locations to expand south state as a result we may engage in mergers acquisitions and other transactions that could have a material effect on our operating results and financial condition including short and longterm liquidity our merger and acquisition activities could be material and could require us to issue a significant number of shares of our common stock or other securities andor to use a substantial amount of cash other liquid assets andor incur debt for example in connection with our proposed merger of equals transaction with centerstate announced on january we will issue additional shares of our common stock to centerstate shareholders which will dilute our current shareholders ownership interest in south state our merger and acquisition activities could involve a number of additional risks including the risks of table start the incurrence and possible impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with an acquisition or merger and possible adverse shortterm effects on our results of operations table endtable start the possibility that the expected benefits of a transaction may not materialize in the timeframe expected or at all or may be costlier to achieve table endtable start incurring the time and expense associated with identifying and evaluating potential merger or acquisition targets table endtable start diversion of our managements attention to the negotiation of a transaction and the integration of the operations and personnel of the combining businesses table endtable start our estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit operations management and market risks with respect to the acquired or merged company may not be accurate table endtable start potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the acquired or merged company table endtable start difficulty or unanticipated expense associated with converting the operating systems of the acquired or merged company into ours table endtable start the possibility that we will be unable to successfully implement integration strategies due to challenges associated with integrating complex systems technology banking centers and other assets of the acquired table end table start or merged company in a manner that minimizes any adverse effect on customers suppliers employees and other constituencies table endtable start delay in completing a merger or acquisition due to litigation closing conditions or the regulatory approval process table endtable start the possibility that a proposed acquisition or merger may not be timely completed if at all table endtable start creating an adverse shortterm effect on our results of operations and table endtable start the possible loss of key employees and customers of south state or the acquired or merged company table end if we do not successfully manage these risks our merger and acquisition activities could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations including shortterm and longterm liquidity and our ability to successfully implement our strategic plan future mergers and acquisitions may be delayed impeded or prohibited due to regulatory issues our mergers and acquisitions including our proposed merger with centerstate are subject to approval by a variety of federal and state regulatory agencies the process for obtaining these required regulatory approvals has become more difficult in recent years regulatory approvals could be delayed impeded restrictively conditioned or denied due to existing or new regulatory issues we have or may have with regulatory agencies including without limitation issues related to antimoney launderingbank secrecy act compliance fair lending laws fair housing laws consumer protection laws unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices regulations community reinvestment act issues and other similar laws and regulations we may fail to pursue evaluate or complete strategic and competitively significant acquisition opportunities as a result of our inability or perceived or anticipated inability to obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner under reasonable conditions or at all difficulties associated with potential mergers and acquisitions that may result from these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may be exposed to difficulties in combining the operations of acquired or merged businesses into our own operations which may prevent us from achieving the expected benefits from our merger and acquisition activities we may not be able to fully achieve the strategic objectives and operating efficiencies that we anticipate in our merger and acquisition activities including our proposed merger with centerstate inherent uncertainties exist in integrating the operations of an acquired or merged business in addition the markets and industries in which we and our potential merger and acquisition targets operate are highly competitive we may lose customers or the customers of acquired or merged entities as a result of an acquisition we may also lose key personnel from the acquired or merged entity as a result of an acquisition we may not discover all known and unknown factors when examining a company for acquisition during the due diligence period these factors could produce unintended and unexpected consequences for us undiscovered factors as a result of an acquisition or merger could bring civil criminal and financial liabilities against us our management and the management of those entities we acquire or merge with in addition if difficulties arise with respect to the integration process the economic benefits expected to result from acquisitions and mergers might not occur failure to successfully integrate businesses that we acquire or merge with could have an adverse effect on our profitability return on equity return on assets or our ability to implement our strategy any of which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations these factors could contribute to our not achieving the expected benefits from our mergers and acquisitions within desired time frames if at all we face risks and uncertainties related to our proposed merger with centerstate before the transactions contemplated in the merger agreement can be completed various approvals must be obtained including approval of the federal reserve and the office of the comptroller of the currency the terms and conditions of the approvals that are granted may impose conditions limitations obligations or costs or place restrictions on the conduct of the combined companys business or require changes to the terms of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement there can be no assurance that regulators will not impose any such conditions limitations obligations or restrictions and that such conditions limitations obligations or restrictions will not have the effect of delaying the completion of any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of the combined company following the merger or otherwise reduce the anticipated benefits of the merger if the merger were consummated successfully within the expected timeframe in addition there can be no assurance that any such conditions terms obligations or restrictions will not result in the delay or abandonment of the merger south state and centerstate have operated and until the completion of the merger will continue to operate independently there can be no assurances that the businesses of south state and centerstate can be integrated successfully it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key south state employees or key centerstate employees the loss of customers the disruption of either companys or both companies ongoing businesses inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies unexpected integration issues higher than expected integration costs and an overall postcompletion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated the success of the merger will depend on among other things the ability of south state and centerstate to combine their businesses in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and realizes cost savings however if the combined company is not able to successfully achieve these objectives the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected in addition the merger agreement contains provisions that restrict each of south states and centerstates ability to among other things initiate solicit knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals with respect to or subject to certain exceptions generally related to its board of directors exercise of its fiduciary duties engage in any negotiations concerning or provide any confidential information relating to any alternative acquisition proposals these provisions which include a million termination fee payable under certain circumstances might discourage a potential competing acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of south state from considering or proposing that acquisition or might result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower per share price to acquire south state than it might otherwise have proposed to pay failure to complete our proposed merger with centerstate could negatively impact our business financial results and stock price if our proposed merger with centerstate is not completed for any reason our ongoing business may be adversely affected and without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the merger we will be subject to a number of risks including the following table start we may be required under certain circumstances to pay centerstate a termination fee of million under the merger agreement table endtable start we will be required to pay certain costs relating to the merger whether or not the merger is completed such as legal accounting financial advisor and printing fees table endtable start the merger agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of both south states and centerstates business before completion of the merger which may adversely affect our ability to execute certain of our business strategies and table endtable start matters relating to the merger may require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management which could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us as an independent company table end in addition if the merger is not completed we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from our customers and employees for example we may be impacted adversely by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the merger without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the merger the market price of our common stock could decline to the extent that the current market prices reflect a market assumption that the merger will be completed we also could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or to proceedings commenced against us to perform our obligations under the merger agreement if the merger is not completed we cannot assure you that the risks described above will not materialize and will not materially affect our business financial results and stock price uncertainty relating to the london interbank offered rate or libor calculation process and potential phasing out of libor may adversely affect us on july the chief executive of the united kingdom financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calibration of libor to the administrator of libor after the announcement indicates that the continuation of libor on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after it is impossible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide libor submissions to the administrator of libor or whether any additional reforms to libor may be enacted in the united kingdom or elsewhere at this time no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become acceptable alternatives to libor and it is impossible to predict the effect of any such alternatives on the value of liborbased securities and variable rate loans or other securities or financial arrangements given libors role in determining market interest rates globally the federal reserve board in conjunction with the alternative reference rates committee a steering committee comprised of large us financial institutions is considering replacing the us dollar libor with a new index calculated by shortterm repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities sofr sofr is observed and backward looking which stands in contrast with libor under the current methodology which is an estimated forwardlooking rate and relies to some degree on the expert judgment of submitting panel members given that sofr is a secured rate backed by government securities it will be a rate that does not take into account bank credit risk as is the case with libor sofr is therefore likely to be lower than libor and is less likely to correlate with the funding costs of financial institutions whether or not sofr attains traction as a libor replacement tool remains in question although some transactions using sofr have been completed in and the future of libor remains uncertain as this time uncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates and as to potential changes or other reforms to libor may adversely affect libor rates and the value of liborbased loans and securities in our portfolio if libor rates are no longer available and we are required to implement substitute indices for the calculation of interest rates under our loan agreements with our borrowers we may experience significant expenses in effecting the transition and may be subject to disputes or litigation with customers and creditors over the appropriateness or comparability to libor of the substitute indices which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations we may be exposed to a need for additional capital resources in the future and these capital resources may not be available when needed or at all we may need to incur additional debt or equity financing in the future to make strategic acquisitions or investments or to strengthen our capital position our ability to raise additional capital if needed will depend on among other things conditions in the capital markets at that time which are outside of our control and our financial performance accordingly we cannot provide assurance that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all if we cannot raise additional capital when needed our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be materially impaired in addition if we decide to raise additional equity capital our current shareholders interests could be diluted our net interest income may decline based on the interest rate environment we depend on our net interest income to drive our profitability net interest income is the difference between the interest income we receive from interest earning assets eg loans and investment securities and the interest expense we pay on interestbearing liabilities eg deposits and borrowings we are exposed to changes in general interest rate levels and other economic factors beyond our control and an increase in our cost of funds could negatively impact our net interest income net interest income will decline in a particular period if table start in a declining interest rate environment more interestearning assets than interestbearing liabilities reprice or mature or table endtable start in a rising interest rate environment more interestbearing liabilities than interestearning assets reprice or mature or table endtable start for acquired loans expected total cash flows decline as our loan balances decline table end our net interest income may decline based on our exposure to a difference in shortterm and longterm interest rates if the difference between the interest rates shrinks or disappears the difference between rates paid on deposits and received on loans could narrow significantly resulting in a decrease in net interest income in addition to these factors if market interest rates rise rapidly interest rate adjustment caps may limit increases in the interest rates on adjustable rate loans thus reducing our net interest income also certain adjustable rate loans reprice based on lagging interest rate indices this lagging effect may also negatively impact our net interest income when general interest rates continue to rise periodically we may not be able to adequately anticipate and respond to changes in market interest rates we may be unable to anticipate changes in market interest rates which are affected by many factors beyond our control including but not limited to inflation recession unemployment money supply monetary policy and other changes that affect financial markets both domestic and foreign our net interest income is affected not only by the level and direction of interest rates but also by the shape of the yield curve and relationships between interest sensitive instruments and key driver rates as well as balance sheet growth customer loan and deposit preferences and the timing of changes in these variables in the event rates increase our interest costs on liabilities may increase more rapidly than our income on interest earning assets thus a deterioration of net interest margins as such fluctuations in interest rates could have significant adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations we are exposed to the possibility that more prepayments may be made by customers to pay down loan balances which could reduce our interest income and profitability prepayment rates stem from consumer behavior conditions in the housing and financial markets general us economic conditions and the relative interest rates on fixedrate and adjustablerate loans therefore changes in prepayment rates are difficult to predict recognition of deferred loan origination costs and premiums paid in originating these loans are normally recognized over the contractual life of each loan as prepayments occur the rate at which net deferred loan origination costs and premiums are expensed will accelerate the effect of the acceleration of deferred costs and premium amortization may be mitigated by prepayment penalties paid by the borrower when the loan is paid in full within a certain period of time which varies between loans if prepayment occurs after the period of time when the loan is subject to a prepayment penalty the effect of the acceleration of premium and deferred cost amortization is no longer mitigated we recognize premiums paid on mortgagebacked securities as an adjustment from interest income over the expected life of the security based on the rate of repayment of the securities acceleration of prepayments on the loans underlying a mortgagebacked security shortens the life of the security increases the rate at which premiums are expensed and further reduces interest income we may not be able to reinvest loan and security prepayments at rates comparable to the prepaid instrument particularly in a period of declining interest rates our historical operating results may not be indicative of our future operating results we may not be able to sustain our historical rate of growth and consequently our historical results of operations will not necessarily be indicative of our future operations various factors such as economic conditions regulatory and legislative considerations and competition may also impede our ability to expand our market presence if we experience a significant decrease in our historical rate of growth our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected because a high percentage of our operating costs are fixed expenses we depend on our executive officers and other key employees to continue the implementation of our strategic plan and we could be harmed by the unexpected loss of their services we are dependent on the ability and experience of our executive officers and other key employees who have substantial experience with our operations the financial services industry and the markets in which we offer products and services employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of our proposed merger with centerstate as employees of south state and centerstate may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company we believe that our continued growth and future success will depend in large part on our ability to motivate and retain these individuals as well as our ability to attract motivate and retain highly qualified senior and middle management personnel and other skilled employees if we are unable to retain personnel including our executive officers and other key employees who are critical to the successful integration of our proposed merger and our future operations we could face disruptions in our operations loss of existing customers loss of key information expertise or knowhow and unanticipated additional recruitment costs if the services of any of our key personnel should become unavailable for any reason we may not be able to identify and hire qualified persons on terms acceptable to us or at all which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operation and future prospects in addition the loss of key personnel could diminish the anticipated benefits of the proposed merger with centerstate if we are unable to offer our key management personnel longterm incentive compensation including options restricted stock and restricted stock units as part of their total compensation package we may have difficulty retaining such personnel which would adversely affect our operations and financial performance we have historically granted equity awards including stock options restricted stock awards or restricted stock units to key management personnel as part of a competitive compensation package our ability to grant equity compensation awards as a part of our total compensation package has been vital to attracting retaining and aligning shareholder interest with a talented management team in a highly competitive marketplace in the future we may seek shareholder approval to adopt new equity compensation plans so that we may issue additional equity awards to management in order for the equity component of our compensation packages to remain competitive in the industry shareholder advisory groups have implemented guidelines and issued voting recommendations related to how much equity companies should be able to grant to employees these advisors influence certain shareholder votes regarding approval of a companys request for approval of new equity compensation plans the factors used to formulate these guidelines and voting recommendations include the volatility of a companys share price and are influenced by broader macroeconomic conditions that can change year to year the variables used by shareholder advisory groups to formulate equity plan recommendations may limit our ability to obtain approval to adopt new equity plans in the future if we are limited in our ability to grant equity compensation awards we would need to explore offering other compelling alternatives to supplement our compensation including longterm cash compensation plans or significantly increased shortterm cash compensation in order to continue to attract and retain key management personnel if we used these alternatives to longterm equity awards our compensation costs could increase and our financial performance could be adversely affected if we are unable to offer key management personnel longterm incentive compensation including stock options restricted stock or restricted stock units as part of their total compensation package we may have difficulty attracting and retaining such personnel which would adversely affect our operations and financial performance we may be adversely affected by the lack of soundness of other financial institutions financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including commercial banks brokers and dealers investment banks and other institutional clients many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client in addition our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by our bank cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to our bank any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations we could experience a loss due to competition with other financial institutions we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors both within and beyond our principal markets many of which are larger and may have more financial resources such competitors primarily include national superregional and internet banks within the various markets in which we operate we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions including without limitation savings and loans credit unions finance companies brokerage firms insurance companies and other financial intermediaries the financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative and regulatory changes and continued consolidation in addition as customer preferences and expectations continue to evolve technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems banks securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company which can offer virtually any type of financial service including banking securities underwriting insurance both agency and underwriting and merchant banking many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures additionally due to their size many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and as a result may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including among other things table start our ability to develop maintain and build upon longterm customer relationships based on top quality service high ethical standards and safe sound assets table end table

economic trends table end failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position which could adversely affect our growth and profitability which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations failure to keep pace with technological change could adversely affect our business the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technologydriven products and services the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs our future success depends in part upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements we may not be able to effectively implement new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations new lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risk from time to time we may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business there are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed in developing and marketing new lines of business andor new products and services we may invest significant time and resources initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business andor new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible external factors such as compliance with regulations competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business andor a new product or service furthermore any new line of business andor new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business andor new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the value of securities in our investment portfolio may decline in the future as of december we owned billion of investment securities the fair value of our investment securities may be adversely affected by market conditions including changes in interest rates and the occurrence of any events adversely affecting the issuer of particular securities in our investments portfolio we analyze our securities on a quarterly basis to determine if an otherthantemporary impairment has occurred the process for determining whether impairment is otherthantemporary usually requires complex subjective judgments about the future financial performance of the issuer in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security because of changing economic and market conditions affecting issuers we may be required to recognize otherthantemporary impairment in future periods which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions technology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions through alternative methods that historically have involved banks for example consumers can now maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts mutual funds or generalpurpose reloadable prepaid cards consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills andor transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries known as disintermediation could result in the loss of fee income as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits the loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost of deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations we are subject to losses due to errors omissions or fraudulent behavior by our employees clients counterparties or other third parties we are exposed to many types of operational risk including the risk of fraud by employees and third parties clerical recordkeeping errors and transactional errors our business is dependent on our employees as well as thirdparty service providers to process a large number of increasingly complex transactions we could be materially and adversely affected if employees clients counterparties or other third parties caused an operational breakdown or failure either as a result of human error fraudulent manipulation or purposeful damage to any of our operations or systems in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties we may rely on information furnished to us by or on behalf of clients and counterparties including financial statements and other financial information we also may rely on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and with respect to financial statements on reports of independent auditors for example in deciding whether to extend credit to clients we may assume that a customers audited financial statements conform to gaap and present fairly in all material respects the financial condition results of operations and cash flows of the customer our earnings are significantly affected by our ability to properly originate underwrite and service loans our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted to the extent we incorrectly assess the creditworthiness of our borrowers fail to detect or respond to deterioration in asset quality in a timely manner or rely on financial statements that do not comply with gaap or are materially misleading the accuracy of our financial statements and related disclosures could be affected because we are exposed to conditions or assumptions different from the judgments assumptions or estimates used in our critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosure in conformity with gaap requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes our critical accounting policies included in this report describe those significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements that are considered critical by us because they require judgments assumptions and estimates that materially impact our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures as a result if future events differ significantly from the judgments assumptions and estimates in our critical accounting policies such events or assumptions could have a material impact on our audited consolidated financial statements and related disclosures we are exposed to the possibility of technology failure and a disruption in our operations may adversely affect our business we rely on our computer systems and the technology of outside service providers our daily operations depend on the operational effectiveness of their technology we rely on our systems to accurately track and record our assets and liabilities if our computer systems or outside technology sources become unreliable fail or experience a breach of security our ability to maintain accurate financial records may be impaired which could materially affect our business operations and financial condition in addition a disruption in our operations resulting from failure of transportation and telecommunication systems loss of power interruption of other utilities natural disaster fire global climate changes computer hacking or viruses failure of technology terrorist activity or the domestic and foreign response to such activity or other events outside of our control could have an adverse impact on the financial services industry as a whole andor on our business our business recovery plan may not be adequate and may not prevent significant interruptions of our operations or substantial losses the increased number of cyberattacks during the past few years has further heightened our attention to this risk as such we are continuously reviewing and implementing additional security controls and generally expanding our cybersecurity team to monitor and assist with the mitigation of this everincreasing risk a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of our third party vendors and other service providers or other third parties including as a result of cyberattacks could disrupt our businesses result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information damage our reputation increase our costs and cause losses we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business information security risks for financial institutions such as ours have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists activists and other external parties as client public and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security have increased our operational systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures disruptions and breakdowns our business financial accounting and data processing systems or other operating systems and facilities may stop operating properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control for example there could be electrical or telecommunications outages natural disasters such as earthquakes tornadoes and hurricanes disease pandemics events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters including terrorist acts and as described below cyberattacks as noted above our business relies on our digital technologies computer and email systems software and networks to conduct its operations although we have information security procedures and controls in place our technologies systems networks and our clients devices may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of our or our clients confidential proprietary and other information or otherwise disrupt our or our clients or other third parties business operations third parties with whom we do business or that facilitate our business activities including financial intermediaries or vendors that provide services or security solutions for our operations and other third parties could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints while we have disaster recovery and other policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure interruption or security breach of our information systems there can be no assurance that any such failures interruptions or security breaches will not occur or if they do occur that they will be adequately addressed our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of the evolving nature of these threats as a result cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of our controls processes and practices designed to protect our systems computers software data and networks from attack damage or unauthorized access remain a focus for us as threats continue to evolve we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate information security vulnerabilities disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and clients or cyberattacks or security breaches of the networks systems or devices that our clients use to access our products and services could result in client attrition regulatory fines penalties or intervention reputational damage reimbursement or other compensation costs andor additional compliance costs any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented which could have a material adverse effect on our business result of operations and financial condition we regularly review and update our internal controls disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures any system of controls however well designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system are met any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures may lead to operational losses including internal and external fraud which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition our deposit insurance premiums could be higher in the future which could have an adverse effect on our future earnings the fdic insures deposits at fdic insured depository institutions such as the bank up to per account the banks regular assessments are based on its average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity as well as by risk classification which includes regulatory capital levels and the level of supervisory concern banks with assets of billion or more such as the bank are subject to a deposit assessment based on a scorecard system that combines regulatory ratings and certain forward looking financial measures intended to assess the risk an institution poses to the deposit insurance fund in addition to ordinary assessments described above the fdic has the ability to impose special assessments in certain instances we are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for fdic insurance if there are additional bank or financial institution failures we may be required to pay even higher fdic premiums if our financial condition deteriorates or if the bank regulators otherwise have supervisory concerns about us then our assessments could rise any future additional assessments increases or required prepayments in fdic insurance premiums could reduce our profitability may limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities or otherwise negatively impact our operations negative public opinion surrounding our bank and the financial institutions industry generally could damage our reputation and adversely impact our earnings reputation risk or the risk to our business earnings and capital from negative public opinion surrounding our bank and the financial institutions industry generally is inherent in our business negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities including lending practices corporate governance mergers and acquisitions and cybersecurity incidents and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to keep and attract clients and employees could impair the confidence of our investors counterparties and business partners and can affect our ability to effect transactions and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action although we take steps to minimize reputation risk in dealing with our clients and communities this risk will always be present given the nature of our business legal and regulatory risks we are subject to extensive regulation that could restrict our activities have an adverse impact on our operations and impose financial requirements or limitations on the conduct of our business we operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to examination supervision and comprehensive regulation by various regulatory agencies south state is subject to federal reserve board regulation and our bank is subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination by our primary federal regulator the fdic the cfpb and by the scbfi also as a member of the federal home loan bank the fhlb the bank must comply with applicable regulations of the federal housing finance board and the fhlb our banks activities are also regulated under consumer protection laws applicable to our lending deposit and other activities a sufficient claim against us under these laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations regulation by these agencies is intended primarily for the protection of our depositors and the deposit insurance fund and not for the benefit of our shareholders congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws regulations and policies for possible changes the doddfrank act enacted in july instituted major changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regimes the doddfrank act and other changes to statutes regulations or regulatory policies or supervisory guidance including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes regulations policies or supervisory guidance could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways including among other things subjecting us to increased capital liquidity and risk management requirements creating additional costs limiting the types of financial services and products we may offer andor increasing the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products failure to comply with laws regulations or policies could also result in heightened regulatory scrutiny and in sanctions by regulatory agencies such as a memorandum of understanding a written supervisory agreement or a cease and desist order civil money penalties andor reputation damage any of these consequences could restrict our ability to expand our business or could require us to raise additional capital or sell assets on terms that are not advantageous to us or our shareholders and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations such violations may occur despite our best efforts because our total consolidated assets exceed billion we are subject to additional regulations and oversight that have not previously been applicable to us and that could materially and adversely affect our revenues and expenses we have become subject to additional regulations and oversight that could adversely affect our revenues and expenses such regulations and oversight include the following the cfpb has broad rulemaking supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services including deposit products residential mortgages home equity loans and credit cards the cfpb has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to banks with over billion in assets such as the bank as a relatively new agency with evolving regulations and practices there is uncertainty as to how the cfpbs examination and regulatory authority might impact our business furthermore with respect to deposittaking activities banks with assets in excess of billion are subject to a deposit assessment based on a new scorecard issued by the fdic this new deposit assessment scorecard calculation which became applicable to the bank starting with the second quarter of considers among other things the banks camels rating results of assetrelated stress testing and fundingrelated stress as well as our use of core deposits among other things depending on the results of a banks performance under that scorecard the total base assessment rate is between to basis points any increase in the banks deposit insurance assessments may result in an increased expense related to our use of deposits as a funding source in addition banks with over billion in total assets are no longer exempt from the requirements of the federal reserves rules on interchange transaction fees for debit cards known as the durbin amendment beginning on july the bank was limited to receiving only a reasonable interchange transaction fee for any debit card transactions processed using debit cards issued by the bank to our customers the federal reserve has determined that it is unreasonable for a bank with more than billion in total assets to receive more than plus basis points of the transaction plus a fraud adjustment for an interchange transaction fee for debit card transactions a reduction in the amount of interchange fees we receive for electronic debit interchange transactions reduced our revenues starting in the third quarter of this regulation which we refer to herein as the durbin amendment became applicable to us on july in reaction of becoming subject to the heightened regulatory requirements we have hired and continue to hire additional compliance personnel and implement structural initiatives to address these requirements however compliance with these requirements may necessitate that we hire additional compliance or other personnel design and implement additional internal controls or incur other significant expenses any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations we are exposed to declines in the value of retirement plan assets or unfavorable changes in laws or regulations that govern retirement plan funding which could require us to provide significant amounts of funding for our retirement plan as a matter of course we anticipate that we will make cash contributions to our retirement plans in the near and long term a significant decline in the value of retirement plan assets in the future or unfavorable changes in laws or regulations that govern retirement plan funding could materially change the timing and amount of required plan funding as a result we may be required to fund our retirement plans with a greater amount of cash from operations perhaps by an additional material amount we may be subject to more stringent capital requirements in the future we are subject to regulatory requirements specifying minimum amounts and types of capital that we must maintain from time to time the regulators change these regulatory capital adequacy guidelines if we fail to meet these minimum capital guidelines and other regulatory requirements we or our subsidiaries may be restricted in the types of activities we may conduct and we may be prohibited from taking certain capital actions such as paying dividends and repurchasing or redeeming capital securities in particular the capital requirements applicable to us under the basel iii rules become fully phasedin on january we are now required to satisfy additional more stringent capital adequacy standards than we had in the past while we expect to meet the requirements of the basel iii rules we may fail to do so failure to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could have an adverse material effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition these requirements could have a negative impact on our ability to lend grow deposit balances make acquisitions or make capital distributions in the form of dividends or share repurchases higher capital levels could also lower our return on equity the federal banking agencies are implementing new liquidity standards that while not directly applicable to us could result in our having to lengthen the term of our funding restructure our business lines by forcing us to seek new sources of liquidity for them andor increase our holdings of liquid assets in the federal banking agencies adopted a liquidity coverage ratio requirement for bank holding companies with billion or more in total assets or billion or more in onbalance sheet foreign exposures and their subsidiary depository institutions with billion or more in total consolidated assets the requirement calls for sufficient high quality liquid assets to meet liquidity needs for a calendar day liquidity stress scenario in the agencies proposed a net stable funding ratio for these institutions which imposes a similar requirement over a oneyear period neither the liquidity coverage standard nor the net stable funding standard apply directly to us but the substance of the standards adequate liquidity over 30day and oneyear periods may inform the regulators assessment of our liquidity we could be required to reduce our holdings of illiquid assets and adversely affect our results and financial condition the us regulators have not yet proposed a net stable funding ratio requirement we face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the bank secrecy act and other antimoney laundering statutes and regulations the federal bank secrecy act the patriot act and other laws and regulations require financial institutions among other duties to institute and maintain effective antimoney laundering programs and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate the federal financial crimes enforcement network established by the us treasury department to administer the bank secrecy act is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators as well as the us department of justice drug enforcement administration and internal revenue service there is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the ofac federal and state bank regulators also have begun to focus on compliance with bank secrecy act and antimoney laundering regulations if our policies procedures and systems are deemed deficient or the policies procedures and systems of the financial institutions that we have already acquired or may acquire in the future are deficient we would be subject to liability including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan including our acquisition plans which would negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us federal state and local consumer lending laws restrict our ability to originate certain mortgage loans and increase our risk of liability with respect to such loans and increase our cost of doing business federal state and local laws have been adopted that are intended to eliminate certain lending practices considered predatory these laws prohibit practices such as steering borrowers away from more affordable products selling unnecessary insurance to borrowers repeatedly refinancing loans and making loans without a reasonable expectation that the borrowers will be able to repay the loans irrespective of the value of the underlying property over the course of the cfpb issued several rules on mortgage lending notably a rule requiring all home mortgage lenders to determine a borrowers ability to repay the loan loans with certain terms and conditions and that otherwise meet the definition of a qualified mortgage may be protected from liability to a borrower for failing to make the necessary determinations in response to these laws and related cfpb rules we have tightened and in the future may further tighten our mortgage loan underwriting standards to determine borrowers ability to repay although it is our policy not to make predatory loans and to determine borrowers ability to repay these laws and related rules create the potential for increased liability with respect to our lending and loan investment activities they increase our cost of doing business and ultimately may prevent us from making certain loans and cause us to reduce the average percentage rate or the points and fees on loans that we do make we are subject to federal and state fair lending laws and failure to comply with these laws could lead to material penalties federal and state fair lending laws and regulations such as the equal credit opportunity act and the fair housing act impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions the department of justice cfpb and other federal and state agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institutions performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation a successful challenge to our performance under the fair lending laws and regulations could adversely impact our rating under the community reinvestment act and result in a wide variety of sanctions including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties injunctive relief imposition of restrictions on merger and acquisition activity and restrictions on expansion activity which could negatively impact our reputation business financial condition and results of operations the federal reserve board may require us to commit capital resources to support the bank the federal reserve board requires a bank holding company to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to a subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank under the source of strength doctrine the federal reserve board may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank in addition the doddfrank act directs the federal bank regulators to require that all companies that directly or indirectly control an insured depository institution serve as a source of strength for the institution under these requirements in the future we could be required to provide financial assistance to our bank if the bank experiences financial distress a capital injection may be required at times when we do not have the resources to provide it and therefore we may be required to borrow the funds in the event of a bank holding companys bankruptcy the bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank moreover bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the holding companys general unsecured creditors including the holders of its note obligations thus any borrowing that must be done by the holding company in order to make the required capital injection becomes more difficult and expensive and will adversely impact the holding companys cash flows financial condition results of operations and prospects a downgrade of the us credit rating could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition in august standard poors ratings services lowered its longterm sovereign credit rating on the us from aaa to aa if us debt ceiling budget deficit or debt concerns domestic or international economic or political concerns or other factors were to result in further downgrades to the us governments sovereign credit rating or its perceived creditworthiness it could adversely affect the us and global financial markets and economic conditions a downgrade of the us governments credit rating or any failure by the us government to satisfy its debt obligations could create financial turmoil and uncertainty which could weigh heavily on the global banking system it is possible that any such impact could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we are party to various claims and lawsuits incidental to our business litigation is subject to many uncertainties such that the expenses and ultimate exposure with respect to many of these matters cannot be ascertained from time to time we our directors our management and our employees are the subject of various claims and legal actions by customers employees shareholders and others whether such claims and legal actions are legitimate or unfounded if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in our favor they may result in significant financial liability andor adversely affect the market perception of us and our products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services in light of the potential cost and uncertainty involved in litigation we have in the past and may in the future settle matters even when we believe we have a meritorious defense certain claims may seek injunctive relief which could disrupt the ordinary conduct of our business and operations or increase our cost of doing business our insurance or indemnities may not cover all claims that may be asserted against us any judgments or settlements in any pending litigation or future claims litigation or investigation could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition and results of operations from time to time we are or may become involved in suits legal proceedings informationgatherings investigations and proceedings by governmental and selfregulatory agencies that may lead to adverse consequences many aspects of the banking business involve a substantial risk of legal liability from time to time we are or may become the subject of informationgathering requests reviews investigations and proceedings and other forms of regulatory inquiry including by bank regulatory agencies selfregulatory agencies the sec and law enforcement authorities the results of such proceedings could lead to significant civil or criminal penalties including monetary penalties damages adverse judgements settlements fines injunctions restrictions on the way we conduct our business or reputational harm we could be subject to changes in tax laws regulations and interpretations or challenges to our income tax provision we compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate any change in enacted tax laws rules or regulatory or judicial interpretations or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could adversely affect our effective tax rate tax payments and results of operations the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our tax positions which could increase our effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations we are subject to audit and review by us federal and state tax authorities any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our financial position and results of operations in addition changes in enacted tax laws such as adoption of a lower income tax rate in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could impact our ability to obtain the future tax benefits represented by our deferred tax assets in addition the determination of our provision for income taxes and other liabilities requires significant judgment by management although we believe that our estimates are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made there is uncertainty surrounding the potential legal regulatory and policy changes by the current presidential administration in the us that may directly affect financial institutions and the global economy the current presidential administration has indicated that it would like to see changes made to certain financial reform regulations including the doddfrank act which has resulted in increased regulatory uncertainty and we are assessing the potential impact on financial and economic markets and on our business changes in federal policy and at regulatory agencies are expected to occur over time through policy and personnel changes which could lead to changes involving the level of oversight and focus on the financial services industry the nature timing and economic and political effects of potential changes to the current legal and regulatory framework affecting financial institutions remain highly uncertain at this time it is unclear what laws regulations and policies may change and whether future changes or uncertainty surrounding future changes will adversely affect our operating environment and therefore our business financial condition and results of operations risks related to an investment in our common stock our ability to pay cash dividends is limited and we may be unable to pay future dividends even if we desire to do so our ability to pay cash dividends may be limited by regulatory restrictions by our banks ability to pay cash dividends to south state and by our need to maintain sufficient capital to support our operations the federal reserve board has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends by bank holding companies in general the federal reserve boards policies provide that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the bank holding company appears consistent with the organizations capital needs asset quality and overall financial condition the federal reserves policies also require that a bank holding company serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks by standing ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to those banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and by maintaining the financial flexibility and capitalraising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks where necessary under the prompt corrective action regulations the ability of a bank holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized these regulatory policies could affect the ability of south state to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions since south state is a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank and does not conduct standalone operations its ability to pay dividends depends on the ability of the bank to pay dividends to it as a south carolina chartered bank the bank is subject to limitations on the amount of dividends that it is permitted to pay unless otherwise instructed by the scbfi or the commissioner of banking the bank is generally permitted under south carolina state banking regulations to pay cash dividends of up to of net income in any calendar year without obtaining the prior approval of the scbfi the federal banking agencies have issued policy statements which provide that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current earnings in addition under federal reserve board regulations a dividend cannot be paid by the bank if it would be less than wellcapitalized after the dividend the federal reserve board may also prevent the payment of a dividend by the bank if it determines that the payment would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice if our bank is not permitted to pay cash dividends to south state it is unlikely that we would be able to pay cash dividends on our common stock moreover holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends only when and if declared by our board of directors although we have historically paid cash dividends on our common stock we are not required to do so and our board of directors could reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future we may issue additional shares of stock or equity derivative securities that will dilute the percentage ownership interest of existing shareholders and may dilute the book value per share of our common stock and adversely affect the terms on which we may obtain additional capital our authorized capital includes  of common stock and  of preferred stock as of december we had  of common stock outstanding and had reserved for issuance  underlying options that are or may become exercisable at an average price of per share in addition as of december we had the ability to issue  of common stock pursuant to options and restricted stock that may be granted in the future under our existing equity compensation plans subject to applicable nasdaq rules our board generally has the authority without action by or vote of the shareholders to issue authorized but unissued shares of stock for any corporate purpose such corporate purposes could include among other things issuances of equitybased incentives under or outside of our equity compensation plans issuances of equity in business combination transactions and issuances of equity to raise additional capital to support growth or to otherwise strengthen our balance sheet any issuance of additional shares of stock or equity derivative securities will dilute the percentage ownership interest of our shareholders and may dilute the book value per share of our common stock shares we issue in connection with any such offering will increase the total number of outstanding shares and may dilute the economic and voting ownership interest of our existing shareholders in connection with our proposed merger with centerstate which was announced on january based on the number of shares of south state common stock and centerstate common stock outstanding as of december and based on the number of shares of south state common stock expected to be issued in the merger the former shareholders of centerstate as a group will receive shares in the merger constituting approximately of the outstanding shares of south state common stock immediately after the merger as a result current shareholders of south state as a group will own approximately of the combined company after the merger the merger which is expected to close in the third quarter of is subject to among other things required regulatory approvals and the affirmative vote of each companys shareholders to approve the merger agreement and in the case of south state to approve an amendment to our articles of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of south state common stock our stock price may be volatile which could result in losses to our investors and litigation against us our stock price has been volatile in the past and several factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future these factors include but are not limited to actual or anticipated variations in earnings changes in analysts recommendations or projections our announcement of developments related to our businesses operations and stock performance of other companies deemed to be peers new technology used or services offered by traditional and nontraditional competitors news reports of trends concerns irrational exuberance on the part of investors and other issues related to the financial services industry our stock price may fluctuate significantly in the future and these fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance general market declines or market volatility in the future especially in the financial institutions sector could adversely affect the price of the companys common stock and the current market price may not be indicative of future market prices stock price volatility may make it more difficult for our investors to resell their common stock when they desire and at prices they find attractive moreover in the past securities class action lawsuits have been instituted against some companies following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities we could in the future be the target of similar litigation securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert managements attention and resources from our normal business future sales of our stock by our shareholders or the perception that those sales could occur may cause our stock price to decline significant sales of our common stock in the public market or the perception that those sales may occur could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline or to be lower than it otherwise might be in the absence of those sales or perceptions state law and provisions in our articles of incorporation or bylaws could make it more difficult for another company to purchase us even though such a purchase may increase shareholder value in many cases shareholders may receive a premium for their shares if we were purchased by another company state law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws could make it difficult for anyone to purchase us without the approval of our board of directors for example our articles of incorporation divide the board of directors into three classes of directors serving staggered threeyear terms with approximately onethird of the board of directors elected at each annual meeting of shareholders this classification of directors makes it more difficult for shareholders to change the composition of the board of directors as a result at least two annual meetings of shareholders would be required for the shareholders to change a majority of the directors whether or not a change in the board of directors would be beneficial and whether or not a majority of shareholders believe that such a change would be desirable our articles of incorporation provide that a merger exchange or consolidation of the company with or the sale exchange or lease of all or substantially all of our assets to any person or entity referred to herein as a fundamental change must be approved by the holders of at least of our outstanding voting stock if the board of directors does not recommend a vote in favor of the fundamental change the articles of incorporation further provide that a fundamental change involving a shareholder that owns or controls or more of our voting stock at the time of the proposed transaction a controlling party must be approved by the holders of at least i of our outstanding voting stock and ii of our outstanding voting stock held by shareholders other than the controlling party unless x the transaction has been recommended to the shareholders by a majority of the entire board of directors or y the consideration per share to be received by our shareholders generally is not less than the highest price per share paid by the controlling party in the acquisition of its holdings of our common stock during the preceding three years the approval by the holders of at least of our outstanding voting stock is required to amend or repeal these provisions contained in our articles of incorporation finally in the event that any such fundamental change is not recommended by the
