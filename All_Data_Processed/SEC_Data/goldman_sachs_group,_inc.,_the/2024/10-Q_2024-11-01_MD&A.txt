credit rating agencies assessment of our liquidity market credit and operational risk management practices our level and variability of earnings our capital base our franchise reputation and management our corporate governance and the external operating and economic environment including in some cases the assumed level of government support or other systemic considerations such as potential resolution certain of our derivatives have been transacted under bilateral agreements with counterparties who may require us to post collateral or terminate the transactions based on changes in our credit ratings we manage our gcla to ensure we would among other potential requirements be able to make the additional collateral or termination payments that may be required in the event of a twonotch reduction in our longterm credit ratings as well as collateral that has not been called by counterparties but is available to them see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information about derivatives with creditrelated contingent features and the additional collateral or termination payments related to our net derivative liabilities under bilateral agreements that could have been called by counterparties in the event of a one or twonotch downgrade in our credit ratings cash flows as a global financial institution our cash flows are complex and bear little relation to our net earnings and net assets consequently we believe that traditional cash flow analysis is less meaningful in evaluating our liquidity position than the liquidity and assetliability management policies described above cash flow analysis may however be helpful in highlighting certain macro trends and strategic initiatives in our businesses nine months ended september our cash and cash equivalents decreased by billion to billion at the end of the third quarter of primarily due to net cash used for operating and investing activities partially offset by net cash provided by financing activities the net cash used for operating activities primarily reflected cash outflows from trading assets partially offset by cash inflows from collateralized transactions reflecting a decrease in collateralized agreements and an increase in collateralized financings trading liabilities and net earnings the net cash used for investing activities primarily reflected net purchases of investments primarily us government and agency obligations accounted for as availableforsale and heldtomaturity securities the net cash provided by financing activities primarily reflected cash inflows from deposits reflecting an increase in consumer deposits partially offset by a decrease in transaction banking deposits and cash inflows from other secured financings partially offset by net repayments of unsecured longterm borrowings nine months ended september our cash and cash equivalents decreased by billion to billion at the end of the third quarter of primarily due to net cash used for investing activities and the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents partially offset by net cash provided by operating activities the net cash used for investing activities primarily reflected net purchases of investments primarily us government obligations accounted for as heldtomaturity securities the decrease in net cash and cash equivalents as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates was due to the us dollar strengthening during the first nine months of the net cash provided by operating activities primarily reflected cash inflows from collateralized transactions reflecting both an increase in collateralized financings and a decrease in collateralized agreements partially offset by cash outflows from trading assets goldman sachs september form 10q the goldman sachs group inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis market risk management overview market risk is the risk of an adverse impact to our earnings due to changes in market conditions our assets and liabilities that give rise to market risk primarily include positions held for market making for our clients and for our investing and financing activities and these positions change based on client demands and our investment opportunities we employ a variety of risk measures each described in the respective sections below to monitor market risk categories of market risk include the following interest rate risk results from exposures to changes in the level slope and curvature of yield curves the volatilities of interest rates prepayment speeds and credit spreads equity price risk results from exposures to changes in prices and volatilities of individual equities baskets of equities and equity indices currency rate risk results from exposures to changes in spot prices forward prices and volatilities of currency rates and commodity price risk results from exposures to changes in spot prices forward prices and volatilities of commodities such as crude oil petroleum products natural gas electricity and precious and base metals market risk which is independent of our revenueproducing units and reports to our chief risk officer has primary responsibility for assessing monitoring and managing our market risk through firmwide oversight across our global businesses managers in revenueproducing units treasury and market risk discuss market information positions and estimated loss scenarios on an ongoing basis managers in revenueproducing units and treasury are accountable for managing risk within prescribed limits these managers have indepth knowledge of their positions markets and the instruments available to hedge their exposures market risk management process our process for managing market risk includes the critical components of our risk management framework described in the overview and structure of risk management as well as the following monitoring compliance with established market risk limits and reporting our exposures diversifying exposures controlling position sizes and evaluating mitigants such as economic hedges in related securities or derivatives our market risk management systems enable us to perform an independent calculation of valueatrisk var earningsatrisk ear and other stress measures capture risk measures at individual position levels attribute risk measures to individual risk factors of each position report many different views of the risk measures eg by desk business product type or entity and produce ad hoc analyses in a timely manner risk measures we produce risk measures and monitor them against established market risk limits these measures reflect an extensive range of scenarios and the results are aggregated at product business and firmwide levels we use a variety of risk measures to estimate the size of potential losses for both moderate and more extreme market moves over both short and longterm time horizons our primary risk measures are var ear and other stress tests our risk reports detail key risks drivers and changes for each desk and business and are distributed daily to senior management of both our revenueproducing units and our independent risk oversight and control functions valueatrisk var is the potential loss in value due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level for assets and liabilities included in var see financial statement linkages to market risk measures we typically employ a oneday time horizon with a confidence level we use a single var model which captures risks including those related to interest rates equity prices currency rates and commodity prices as such var facilitates comparison across portfolios of different risk characteristics var also captures the diversification of aggregated risk at the firmwide level goldman sachs september form 10q the goldman sachs group inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis we are aware of the inherent limitations to var and therefore use a variety of risk measures in our market risk management process inherent limitations to var include var does not estimate potential losses over longer time horizons where moves may be extreme var does not take account of the relative liquidity of different risk positions and previous moves in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of all future market moves to comprehensively capture our exposures and relevant risks in our var calculation we use historical simulations with full valuation of market factors at the position level by simultaneously shocking the relevant market factors for that position these market factors include spot prices credit spreads funding spreads yield curves volatility and correlation and are updated periodically based on changes in the composition of positions as well as variations in market conditions we sample from five years of historical data to generate the scenarios for our var calculation the historical data is weighted so that the relative importance of the data reduces over time this gives greater importance to more recent observations and reflects current asset volatilities which improves the accuracy of our estimates of potential loss as a result even if our positions included in var were unchanged our var would increase with increasing market volatility and vice versa given its reliance on historical data var is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions our var measure does not include positions that are not accounted for at fair value such as heldtomaturity securities and loans deposits and unsecured borrowings that are accounted for at amortized cost availableforsale securities for which the related unrealized fair value gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive incomeloss positions that are best measured and monitored using sensitivity measures and the impact of changes in counterparty and our own credit spreads on derivatives as well as changes in our own credit spreads on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected we perform daily backtesting of our var model ie comparing daily net revenues for positions included in var to the var measure calculated as of the prior business day at the firmwide level and for each of our businesses and major regulated subsidiaries earningsatrisk we manage our interest rate risk using the ear metric ear measures the estimated impact of changes in interest rates to our net revenues and preferred stock dividends over a defined time horizon ear complements the var metric which measures the impact of interest rate changes that have an immediate impact on the fair values of our assets and liabilities ie marktomarket changes our exposure to interest rate risk occurs due to a variety of factors including but not limited to differences in maturity or repricing dates of assets liabilities preferred stock and certain offbalance sheet instruments differences in the amounts of assets liabilities preferred stock and certain offbalance sheet instruments with the same maturity or repricing dates certain interest rate sensitive fees treasury manages the aggregated interest rate risk from all businesses using our investment securities portfolio and interest rate derivatives we measure ear over a oneyear time horizon following a and 200basis point instantaneous parallel shock in both short and longterm interest rates this sensitivity is calculated relative to a baseline market scenario which takes into consideration among other things the markets expectation of forward rates as well as our expectation of future business activity these scenarios include contractual elements of assets liabilities preferred stock and certain offbalance sheet instruments such as rates of interest principal repayment schedules maturity and reset dates and any interest rate ceilings or floors as well as assumptions with respect to our balance sheet size and composition prepayment behavior and deposit repricing deposit repricing is captured by evaluating the change in deposit rate paid relative to the change in market rates deposit beta and we calibrate the deposit betas used in our models by using a number of factors including observed historical behavior future expectations funding needs and the competitive landscape we continuously monitor the performance of our key assumptions against observed behavior and regularly review their sensitivity on our risk metrics we manage ear with a goal to reduce potential volatility resulting from changes in interest rates so it remains within our ear risk appetite our ear scenario is regularly evaluated and updated if necessary to reflect changes in our business plans market conditions and other macroeconomic factors while management uses the best information available to estimate ear actual results may differ materially as a result of among other things changes in the economic environment or assumptions used in the process we also measure the sensitivity of the economic value of our equity eve to changes in interest rates compared to ear eve provides a longerterm measurement of the interest rate risk exposure primarily on nontrading assets and liabilities by capturing the net impact of changes in interest rates to the present value of their cash flows goldman sachs september form 10q the goldman sachs group inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis risk which is independent of our revenueproducing units and treasury have primary responsibility for assessing and monitoring ear and eve sensitivity through firmwide oversight including oversight of interest rate risk stress testing and assumptions and the establishment of our risk appetite stress testing stress testing is a method of determining the effect of various hypothetical stress scenarios we use stress tests to examine risks of specific portfolios as well as the potential impact of our significant risk exposures we use a variety of stress testing techniques to calculate the potential loss from a wide range of market moves on our portfolios including firmwide stress tests sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis the results of our various stress tests are analyzed together for risk management purposes see overview and structure of risk management for information about firmwide stress tests sensitivity analysis is used to quantify the impact of a market move in a single risk factor across all positions eg equity prices or credit spreads using a variety of defined market shocks ranging from those that could be expected over a oneday time horizon up to those that could take many months to occur we also use sensitivity analysis to quantify the impact of the default of any single entity which captures the risk of large or concentrated exposures scenario analysis is used to quantify the impact of a specified event including how the event impacts multiple risk factors simultaneously for example for sovereign stress testing we calculate potential direct exposure associated with our sovereign positions as well as the corresponding debt equity and currency exposures associated with our nonsovereign positions that may be impacted by the sovereign distress when conducting scenario analysis we often consider a number of possible outcomes for each scenario ranging from moderate to severely adverse market impacts in addition these stress tests are constructed using both historical events and forwardlooking hypothetical scenarios unlike var measures which have an implied probability because they are calculated at a specified confidence level there may not be an implied probability that our stress testing scenarios will occur instead stress testing is used to model both moderate and more extreme moves in underlying market factors when estimating potential loss we generally assume that our positions cannot be reduced or hedged although experience demonstrates that we are generally able to do so limits we use market risk limits at various levels to manage the size of our market exposures these limits are set based on var ear and on a range of stress tests relevant to our exposures see overview and structure of risk management for information about the limit approval process limits are monitored by treasury and risk risk is responsible for identifying and escalating to senior management andor the appropriate risk committee on a timely basis instances where limits have been exceeded eg due to positional changes or changes in market conditions such as increased volatilities or changes in correlations such instances are remediated by a reduction in the positions we hold andor a temporary or permanent increase to the limit if warranted metrics we analyze var at the firmwide level and a variety of more detailed levels including by risk category business and region diversification effect in the tables below represents the difference between total var and the sum of the vars for the four risk categories this effect arises because the four market risk categories are not perfectly correlated substantially all positions in var are included within global banking markets the table

diversification effect total our average daily var of million for the three months ended september was essentially unchanged compared with the three months ended june increases in the equity prices and commodity prices categories and a decrease in the diversification effect were largely offset by decreases in the interest rates and currency rates categories our average daily var increased to million for the three months ended september from million for the three months ended september primarily due to increased exposures the total increase was primarily driven by increases in the equity prices and currency rates categories partially offset by a decrease in the interest rates category goldman sachs september form 10q the goldman sachs group inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis our average daily var decreased to million for the nine months ended september from million for the nine months ended september due to lower levels of volatility partially offset by

increase to the firmwide var risk limit due to higher levels of volatility and increased exposures the firmwide var risk limit was not exceeded during this period during the firmwide var risk limit was not exceeded and there were no permanent changes to the firmwide var risk limit however the firmwide var risk limit was temporarily changed on four occasions as a result of changes in the market

prices currency rates commodity prices firmwide var the chart below presents our daily var for the nine months ended september the table below presents by number of business days the frequency distribution of our daily net revenues for positions included in var three months ended september nine months ended september in millions total daily net revenues for positions included in var are compared with var calculated as of the end of the prior business day net losses incurred on a single day for such positions exceeded our oneday var ie a var exception on two occasions during the three and nine months ended september there were no var exceptions during the three months ended september and there was one var exception during the nine months ended september during periods in which we have significantly more positive net revenue days than net revenue loss days we expect to have fewer var exceptions because under normal conditions our business model generally produces positive net revenues in periods in which our franchise revenues are adversely affected we generally have more loss days resulting in more var exceptions the daily net revenues for positions included in var used to determine var exceptions reflect the impact of any intraday activity including bidoffer net revenues which are more likely than not to be positive by their nature goldman sachs september form 10q

interest rate risk for all positions within our consolidated balance sheets using the ear metric credit risk management overview credit risk represents the potential for loss due to the default or deterioration in credit quality of a counterparty eg an otc derivatives counterparty or a borrower or an issuer of securities or other instruments we hold our exposure to credit risk comes mostly from client transactions in otc derivatives and loans and lending commitments credit risk also comes from cash placed with banks securities financing transactions ie resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending activities and customer and other receivables credit risk which is independent of our revenueproducing units and reports to our chief risk officer has primary responsibility for assessing monitoring and managing our credit risk through firmwide oversight across our global businesses in addition we hold other positions that give rise to credit risk eg bonds and secondary bank loans these credit risks are captured as a component of market risk measures which are monitored and managed by market risk we also enter into derivatives to manage market risk exposures such derivatives also give rise to credit risk which is monitored and managed by credit risk credit risk management process our process for managing credit risk includes the critical components of our risk management framework described in the overview and structure of risk management as well as the following monitoring compliance with established credit risk limits and reporting our credit exposures and credit concentrations establishing or approving underwriting standards assessing the likelihood that a counterparty will default on its payment obligations measuring our current and potential credit exposure and losses resulting from a counterparty default using credit risk mitigants including collateral and hedging and maximizing recovery through active workout and restructuring of claims we also perform credit analyses which incorporate initial and ongoing evaluations of the capacity and willingness of a counterparty to meet its financial obligations for substantially all of our credit exposures the core of our process is an annual counterparty credit evaluation or more frequently if deemed necessary as a result of events or changes in circumstances we determine an internal credit rating for the counterparty by considering the results of the credit evaluations and assumptions with respect to the nature of and outlook for the counterpartys industry and the economic environment for collateralized loans we also take into consideration collateral received or other credit support arrangements when determining an internal credit rating senior personnel with expertise in specific industries inspect and approve credit reviews and internal credit ratings our risk assessment process may also include where applicable reviewing certain key metrics including but not limited to delinquency status collateral value fico credit scores and other risk factors goldman sachs september form 10q the goldman sachs group inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis our credit risk management systems capture credit exposure to individual counterparties and on an aggregate basis to counterparties and their subsidiaries these systems also provide management with comprehensive information about our aggregate credit risk by product internal credit rating industry country and region risk measures we measure our credit risk based on the potential loss in the event of nonpayment by a counterparty using current and potential exposure for derivatives and securities financing transactions current exposure represents the amount presently owed to us after taking into account applicable netting and collateral arrangements while potential exposure represents our estimate of the future exposure that could arise over the life of a transaction based on market movements within a specified confidence level potential exposure also takes into account netting and collateral arrangements for loans and lending commitments the primary measure is a function of the notional amount of the position stress tests we conduct regular stress tests to calculate the credit exposures including potential concentrations that would result from applying shocks to counterparty credit ratings or credit risk factors eg currency rates interest rates equity prices these shocks cover a wide range of moderate and more extreme market movements including shocks to multiple risk factors consistent with the occurrence of a severe market or economic event in the case of sovereign default we estimate the direct impact of the default on our sovereign credit exposures changes to our credit exposures arising from potential market moves in response to the default and the impact of credit market deterioration on corporate borrowers and counterparties that may result from the sovereign default unlike potential exposure which is calculated within a specified confidence level stress testing does not generally assume a probability of these events occurring we also perform firmwide stress tests see overview and structure of risk management for information about firmwide stress tests to supplement these regular stress tests as described above we also conduct tailored stress tests on an ad hoc basis in response to specific market events that we deem significant we also utilize these stress tests to estimate the indirect impact of certain hypothetical events on our country exposures such as the impact of credit market deterioration on corporate borrowers and counterparties along with the shocks to the risk factors described above the parameters of these shocks vary based on the scenario reflected in each stress test we review estimated losses produced by the stress tests in order to understand their magnitude highlight potential loss concentrations and assess and seek to mitigate our exposures where necessary limits we use credit risk limits at various levels as well as underwriting standards to manage the size and nature of our credit exposures limits for industries and countries are based on our risk appetite and are designed to allow for regular monitoring review escalation and management of credit risk concentrations see overview and structure of risk management for information about the limit approval process credit risk is responsible for monitoring these limits and identifying and escalating to senior management andor the appropriate risk committee on a timely basis instances where limits have been exceeded risk mitigants to reduce our credit exposures on derivatives and securities financing transactions we may enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties we may also reduce credit risk with counterparties by entering into agreements that enable us to obtain collateral from them on an upfront or contingent basis andor to terminate transactions if the counterpartys credit rating falls below a specified level we monitor the fair value of the collateral to ensure that our credit exposures are appropriately collateralized we seek to minimize exposures where there is a significant positive correlation between the creditworthiness of our counterparties and the market value of collateral we receive for loans and lending commitments depending on the credit quality of the borrower and other characteristics of the transaction we employ a variety of potential risk mitigants risk mitigants include collateral provisions guarantees covenants structural seniority of the bank loan
