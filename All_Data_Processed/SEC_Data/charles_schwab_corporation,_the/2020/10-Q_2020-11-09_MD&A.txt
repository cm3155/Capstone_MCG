anticipate the acquisition of td ameritrade will significantly increase our scale to help support the companys ongoing efforts to enhance the client experience provide deeper resources for individual investors as well as rias and continue to improve our operating efficiency with a combined total for schwab and td ameritrade of approximately trillion in client assets and million brokerage accounts at the time of closing we expect our enhanced scale will lower total expenses as a percentage of client assets combining the respective strengths of schwab and td ameritrade will enable the company to invest in enhanced client experience capabilities and further our financial success to the benefit of clients employees and stockholders the integration of schwabs and td ameritrades operations is expected to occur over to months from the date of acquisition though planning for integration has been underway since the acquisition was announced on november in october the company began efforts to reduce overlapping or redundant roles across the two firms and to rationalize branch locations of schwab and tda these and other integration activities are expected to continue throughout the integration process until the integration is complete schwab and td ameritrade will continue to operate separate brokerdealers to serve their respective clients starting in the fourth quarter of td

institutions cash held in td ameritrades eligible customer accounts will continue to be swept to money market deposit accounts at the td depository institutions schwab will provide marketing

certain yields less a service fee on client cash deposits held at the td depository institutions fdic deposit assessments and interest on deposits paid to customers under the amended ida the service fee on client cash deposits held at the td depository institutions was reduced by from basis points to basis points for the life of the agreement under tdas prior ida agreement tda had floors in place which enabled them to carveout up to billion of floatingrate investments from the applicable service fee during specified lowrate environments pursuant to the amended ida agreement the basis point service fee will be applied across all designated fixed and floating ida balances beginning in the fourth quarter of we expect to begin recognizing significant bank deposit account fee revenue pursuant to the amended ida agreement with the td depository institutions and tdas existing agreements with other thirdparty depository institutions the net fees earned by schwab under these arrangements will be included in a new revenue line item in our consolidated statement of income titled bank deposit account fees in addition as part of our management of interest rate risk schwab will begin performing interest rate sensitivity analysis on our bank deposit account fee revenue beginning july schwab will have the option to begin reducing deposit balances swept to the td depository institutions by up to billion over each 12month period subject to certain limitations and adjustments migrating them instead to schwabs balance sheet our ability to migrate these balances to our balance sheet is dependent on certain binding limitations including schwabs obligation to move all of the uninsured ida sweep balances on that date and the requirement that schwab can only move floating ida balances schwabs initial reduction will also be affected by the net change in ida sweep balances between the effective date of the ida agreement and june in addition schwab also must maintain a minimum billion ida sweep balance through june and at least of the ida sweep balances must be designated as fixedrate obligations through june the charles schwab corporation managements

amounts and the spread between short and longterm interest rates interestearning assets primarily include investment securities margin loans and bank loans these assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in prepayment levels that tend to increase in a declining rate environment and decrease in a rising rate environment because we establish the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and bank deposits and the rates charged on certain margin and bank loans and control the composition of our investment securities we have some ability to manage our net interest spread depending on competitive factors and market conditions the charles schwab corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tabular amounts in millions except ratios or as noted net interest revenue sensitivity analysis assumes that the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates as we actively manage the consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure in all likelihood we would take steps to manage additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment the following table shows the simulated net interest revenue change over the next months beginning september and december of a gradual basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates at the end of each reporting period september december increase of basis points decrease of basis points the change in net interest revenue sensitivities as of september reflects a significantly lower interest rate curve from the fourth quarter of due to the global economic impact from the covid19 pandemic higher shortterm interest rates would positively impact net interest revenue as yields on interestearning assets are expected to rise faster than the cost of funding sources a decline in interest rates could negatively impact the yield on the companys investment and loan portfolio to a greater degree than any offsetting reduction in interest expense from funding sources compressing net interest margin in addition to measuring the effect of a gradual basis point parallel increase or decrease in current interest rates we regularly simulate the effects of larger parallel and nonparallel shifts in interest rates on net interest revenue economic value of equity simulation management also uses economic value of equity eve simulations to measure interest rate risk eve sensitivity measures the longterm impact of interest rate changes on the net present value of assets and liabilities eve is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to hypothetical instantaneous shifts in the level of interest rates this analysis is highly dependent upon asset and liability assumptions based on historical behaviors as well as our expectations of the economic environment key assumptions in our eve calculation include projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors prepayment speeds of mortgagerelated investments term structure models of interest rates nonmaturity deposit behavior and pricing assumptions as a result of the low interest rate environment in the third quarter and first nine months of the downward assessments of our net interest revenue and eve simulations as of september reflected the assumption of nonnegative investment yields through our ida agreement and bank deposit account agreements with other thirdparty depository institutions resulting from our acquisition of td ameritrade we expect to start earning significant bank deposit account fee revenue beginning in the fourth quarter of though accounted for and presented separately from net interest revenue bank deposit account fee revenue will be sensitive to interest rates therefore beginning in the fourth quarter of management will evaluate bank deposit account fee revenue as part of schwabs comprehensive management of our exposure to interest rate risk through modeling and simulation analysis see overview and item notes and for additional information on the companys acquisition of td ameritrade and the amended ida agreement expected phaseout of libor the company has established a firmwide team to address the likely discontinuation of libor as part of our efforts we have assessed our libor exposures the largest of which are certain investment securities and loans in purchasing new investment securities we ensure that appropriate fallback language is in the securitys prospectus in the event that libor is unavailable or deemed unreliable and we have sold certain securities lacking appropriate fallback language we are updating loan agreements to ensure new liborbased loans adequately provide for an alternative to libor furthermore we plan to phaseout the use of libor as a reference rate in our new lending products before december consistent with our through clients eyes strategy our focus throughout the libor transition process is to ensure clients are treated fairly and consistently as this major change is occurring in the financial markets the
