sensitivity analysis we use net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates the simulations include all balance sheet interest ratesensitive assets and liabilities key assumptions include the projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors prepayment speeds of mortgagerelated investments repricing of financial instruments and reinvestment of matured or paiddown securities and loans net interest revenue is affected by various factors such as the distribution and composition of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities the spread between yields earned on interestearning assets and rates paid on interestbearing liabilities which may reprice at different times or by different amounts and the spread between short and longterm interest rates interestearning assets include investment securities margin loans and bank loans these assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in prepayment levels that tend to increase in a declining rate environment and decrease in a rising rate environment because we establish the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and bank deposits and the rates charged on certain margin and bank loans and control the composition of our investment securities we have some ability to manage our net interest spread depending on competitive factors and market conditions net interest revenue sensitivity analysis assumes the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates as we actively manage the consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure in all likelihood we would take steps to manage additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment the following table shows the simulated change to net interest revenue over the next months beginning december and of a gradual basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates at the end of each reporting period table start december increase of basis points decrease of basis points table end the companys simulated increase of basis points in market interest rates had a slightly lower impact on net interest revenue at yearend compared with yearend due to an increase in the companys projected repricing of client deposit rates across higher market interest rate scenarios which was partially offset as a result of holding a higher allocation of floatingrate assets on the balance sheet at december relative to the prior yearend a simulated decrease of basis points in market interest rates had a slightly larger impact yearoveryear primarily as a result of holding a higher allocation of floatingrate assets higher shortterm interest rates would positively impact net interest revenue as yields on interestearning assets are expected to rise faster than the cost of funding sources a decline in interest rates could negatively impact the yield on the companys investment and loan portfolio to a greater degree than any offsetting reduction in interest expense from funding sources compressing net interest margin the charles schwab corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tabular amounts in millions except ratios or as noted in addition to measuring the effect of a gradual basis point parallel increase or decrease in current interest rates we regularly simulate the effects of larger parallel and nonparallel shifts in interest rates on net interest revenue bank deposit account fees simulation consistent with the presentation on the consolidated statement of income the sensitivity of bank deposit account fee revenue to interest rate changes is assessed separately from the net interest revenue simulation described above as of december and simulated changes in bank deposit account fee revenue from gradual basis point changes in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates did not have a significant impact on the companys total net revenues economic value of equity simulation management also uses eve simulations to measure interest rate risk eve sensitivity measures the longterm impact of interest rate changes on the net present value of assets and liabilities eve is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to hypothetical instantaneous shifts in the level of interest rates this analysis is highly dependent upon asset and liability assumptions based on historical behaviors as well as our expectations of the economic environment key assumptions in our eve calculation include projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors prepayment speeds of

company might face the capital contingency plan is issued under the authority of the financial risk oversight committee and provides guidelines for sustained capital events it does not specifically address every contingency but is designed to provide a framework for responding to any capital stress the results of the stress testing indicate there are two scenarios which could stress the companys capital inflows of balance sheet cash during a period of very low interest rates and outflows of balance sheet cash when other sources of financing are not available and the company is required to sell assets to fund the flows at a loss the capital contingency plan is reviewed annually and updated as appropriate for additional information see business regulation in part i item regulatory capital requirements csc is subject to capital requirements set by the federal reserve and is required to serve as a source of strength for our banking subsidiaries and to provide financial assistance if our banking subsidiaries experience financial distress schwab is required to maintain a tier leverage ratio for csc of at least and we have a longterm operating objective of due to the relatively low risk of our balance sheet assets and riskbased capital ratios at csc and csb that are well in excess of regulatory requirements the tier leverage ratio is the most restrictive capital constraint on cscs asset growth our banking subsidiaries are subject to capital requirements set by their regulators that are substantially similar to those imposed on csc by the federal reserve our banking subsidiaries failure to remain well capitalized could result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that could have a direct material effect on the banks schwabs principal banking subsidiary csb is required to maintain a tier leverage ratio of at least to be well capitalized but seeks to maintain a ratio of at least based on its regulatory capital

of significant inflows of client cash in our tier leverage ratio for consolidated csc and csb declined below our longterm operating objectives in the companys issuances of preferred stock and strength in earnings helped to largely maintain our tier leverage ratio even as bank deposits and payables to brokerage clients grew by a total of billion or during the year we ended with a consolidated tier leverage ratio of down slightly from the prior yearend of earnings in as well as capital contributions from csc drove an increase in csbs tier leverage ratio from at yearend to at yearend though our tier leverage ratio is below our longterm operating objective for consolidated csc this ratio is well above the regulatory minimum the pace of return to our longterm operating objective over time depends on a number of factors including the overall size of the companys balance sheet earnings and capital issuance and deployment ida agreement through december schwab had moved billion of ida balances to its balance sheet which included uninsured balances and certain international account balances the companys overall capital management strategy includes supporting migration of ida balances in future periods as available pursuant to the terms of the ida agreement the companys ability to migrate these balances to its balance sheet is dependent upon multiple factors including having sufficient capital levels to sustain the charles schwab corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tabular amounts in millions except

schwab have been prepared in accordance with gaap item note contains more information on our significant accounting policies made in applying these accounting principles while the majority of the revenues expenses assets and liabilities are not based on estimates there are certain accounting principles that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change where such change may result in a material adverse impact on schwabs financial position and financial results these critical accounting estimates are described below management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors additionally management has reviewed with the audit committee the companys significant estimates discussed in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations income taxes schwab estimates income tax expense based on amounts expected to be owed to the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate including federal state and local domestic jurisdictions and immaterial amounts owed to several foreign jurisdictions the estimated income tax expense is reported in the consolidated statements of income in taxes on income accrued taxes are reported in other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from taxing jurisdictions either currently or deferred to future periods deferred taxes arise from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting purposes versus income tax reporting purposes deferred tax assets are recognized if in managements judgment their realizability is determined to be more likely than not uncertain tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize an uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit management believes is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement in estimating accrued taxes we assess the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment considering statutory judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the tax position because of the complexity of tax laws and regulations interpretation can be difficult and subject to legal judgment given specific facts and circumstances changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates interpretations of tax laws the status of examinations being conducted by various taxing authorities and newly enacted statutory judicial and regulatory guidance that impacts the relative merits and risks of tax positions these changes when they occur affect accrued taxes and can be significant to the operating results of the company see item note for more information on the companys income taxes the charles schwab corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tabular amounts in millions except ratios or as noted legal and regulatory reserves reserves for legal and regulatory claims and proceedings reflect an estimate of probable losses for each matter after considering among other factors the progress of the case prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases available defenses and the opinions and views of legal counsel in many cases including most class action lawsuits it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred or to estimate the range of that loss until the matter is close to resolution in which case no accrual is made until that time reserves are adjusted as more information becomes available significant judgment is required in making these estimates and the actual cost of resolving a matter may ultimately differ materially from the amount reserved see item note for more information on the companys contingencies related to legal and regulatory reserves business combinations we have accounted for our acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting the acquisition method requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially at the acquisition date as we allocate the purchase price to the estimated fair values of acquired tangible and intangible assets and the liabilities assumed we also use our best estimates to determine the useful lives of the tangible and definitelived intangible assets which impact the periods over which depreciation and amortization of those assets are recognized these best estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain as they pertain to forward looking views of our businesses client behavior and market conditions in our acquisitions we have also recognized goodwill at the amount by which the purchase price paid exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired see item notes and for more information on our valuation methods and the results of applying the acquisition method of accounting including the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and where relevant the estimated remaining useful lives our ongoing accounting for goodwill and the tangible and intangible assets acquired requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions as we exercise judgement to evaluate these assets for impairment our processes and accounting policies for evaluating impairments are further described in item note one of our reporting units has an immaterial amount of goodwill the results of the annual goodwill impairment testing for our other two reporting units indicated that the estimated fair values substantially exceeded their carrying amounts the charles schwab corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tabular amounts in millions except ratios or as noted nongaap financial measures in addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us gaap managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contain references to the nongaap financial measures described below we believe these nongaap financial measures provide useful supplemental information about the financial performance of the company and facilitate meaningful comparison of schwabs results in the current period to both historic and future results these nongaap measures should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap and may not be comparable to nongaap financial measures presented by other companies schwabs use of nongaap measures is reflective of certain adjustments made to gaap financial measures as described below table start nongaap adjustment or measure definition usefulness to investors and uses by management acquisition and integrationrelated costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets schwab adjusts certain gaap financial measures to exclude the impact of acquisition and integrationrelated costs incurred as a result of the companys acquisitions amortization of acquired intangible assets and where applicable the income tax effect of these expenses adjustments made to exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets are reflective of all acquired intangible assets which were recorded as part of purchase accounting these acquired intangible assets contribute to the companys revenue generation amortization of acquired intangible assets will continue in future periods over their remaining useful lives we exclude acquisition and integrationrelated costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets for the purpose of calculating certain nongaap measures because we believe doing so provides additional transparency of schwabs ongoing operations and is useful in both evaluating the operating performance of the business and facilitating comparison of results with prior and future periods acquisition and integrationrelated costs fluctuate based on the timing of acquisitions and integration activities thereby limiting comparability of results among periods and are not representative of the costs of running the companys ongoing business amortization of acquired intangible assets is excluded because management does not believe it is indicative of the companys underlying operating performance return on tangible common equity return on tangible common equity represents annualized adjusted net income available to common stockholders as a percentage of average tangible common equity tangible common equity represents common equity less goodwill acquired intangible assets net and related deferred tax liabilities acquisitions typically result in the recognition of significant amounts of goodwill and acquired intangible assets we believe return on tangible common equity may be useful to investors as a supplemental measure to facilitate assessing capital efficiency and returns relative to the composition of schwabs balance sheet table end the company also uses adjusted diluted eps and return on tangible common equity as components of performance criteria for employee bonus and certain executive management incentive compensation arrangements the compensation committee of cscs board of directors maintains discretion in evaluating
