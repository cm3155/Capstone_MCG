was and in the third quarter and first nine months of respectively compared with and in the same periods in the prior year the increases in both return on average common stockholders equity and rotce were due primarily to lower stockholders equity and higher net income stockholders equity declined in the first nine months of due to a significant decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci as higher market interest rates resulted in larger unrealized losses on our available for sale afs portfolio the company continued its diligent approach to balance sheet management amid a rapidly evolving macroeconomic environment in the first nine months of maintaining appropriate capital and liquidity to support client activity and returning excess capital to stockholders total balance sheet assets of billion at september were down in the third quarter and down from yearend primarily due to decreases in bank deposits and payables to brokerage clients as a result of client cash allocation

effective october the company completed its acquisition of td ameritrade holding corporation tda holding and its consolidated subsidiaries collectively referred to as td ameritrade or tda integration work continued during the first nine months of based on our current integration plans and expanded scope of technology work the company now expects to complete most client conversions across multiple groups over the course of with certain client groups to be completed in early we now expect to incur total acquisition and integrationrelated costs and capital expenditures of between billion and billion which reflects increased costs resulting from incremental complexity in conversion work due in part to the replacement of certain vendor resources following russias invasion of ukraine as well as overall inflationary pressures the companys estimates of the nature amounts and timing of recognition of acquisition and integrationrelated costs remain subject to change based on a number of factors including the expected duration and complexity of the integration process and the continued uncertainty of the economic environment more specifically factors that could cause variability in our expected acquisition and integrationrelated costs include the level of employee attrition and availability of thirdparty labor workforce redeployment from eliminated positions into open roles changes in the levels of client activity as well as changes in the scope and cost of technology and real estaterelated exit cost variability due to effects of changes in remote working trends acquisition and integrationrelated costs which are inclusive of related exit costs totaled million and million for the third quarter and first nine months of respectively and million and million for the third quarter and first nine months of respectively over the course of the integration we continue to expect to realize annualized cost synergies of between billion and billion and through september we have achieved over half of this amount on an annualized runrate basis the company expects to realize the vast majority of the remaining estimated cost synergies by the end of estimated timing and amounts of synergy realization are subject to change as we progress in the integration refer to part ii item overview in our form 10k and item note for additional information regarding our integration of td ameritrade current regulatory environment and other developments results of the federal reserves comprehensive capital analysis and review in june the company received the results of the federal reserves comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar these results included the federal reserves estimate of cscs minimum capital ratios under the supervisory severely adverse scenario for the ninequarter horizon beginning december and ending march based on these results cscs calculated stress capital buffer was below the minimum resulting in a stress capital buffer at the floor this stress capital buffer became applicable on october see item note for additional information regarding our capital requirements inflation reduction act of excise tax on share repurchases in august the inflation reduction act of inflation reduction act was enacted into law among many other items the inflation reduction act imposes a nondeductible excise tax on a publicly traded corporation on the fair market value of certain stock that it repurchases net of issuances effective for repurchases after december the company believes share repurchases made under its current repurchase authorization beginning in will become subject to this tax we expect to recognize the tax as a direct and incremental cost associated with these transactions for repurchases of common stock we expect the tax will be recorded as part of the cost basis of the treasury stock repurchased resulting in no income statement impact federal deposit insurance corporation fdic assessment rate increase in october the fdic adopted a final rule to increase the initial base deposit insurance assessment rates by basis points beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of the fdic has stated that this change is intended to raise the fdics deposit insurance fund dif reserve ratio to the minimum threshold within the fdics established dif restoration plan and will remain in effect until the dif reserve ratio meets the fdics longterm goal of a basis point increase in the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate will result in a corresponding increase in regulatory fees and assessments

the charles schwab corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tabular amounts in millions except ratios or as noted net interest revenue revenue on interestearning assets is affected by various factors such as the composition of assets prevailing interest rates and spreads at the time of origination or purchase changes in interest rates on floatingrate securities and loans and changes in prepayment levels for mortgagebacked and other assetbacked securities and loans schwab establishes the rates paid on clientrelated liabilities and management expects that it will generally adjust the rates paid on these liabilities at some fraction of any movement in shortterm rates interest expense on longterm debt shortterm borrowings and other funding sources is impacted by market interest rates at the time of borrowing and changes in interest rates on floatingrate debt interest rates increased significantly from yearend through september shortterm rates were near zero until the federal reserve began its aggressive tightening cycle in response to rising inflation beginning in march ultimately increasing the federal funds target overnight rate five times between march and september for a total increase of basis points while longterm interest rates increased throughout the first nine months of the year schwab continued to see strength in net new client assets during the first nine months of which along with transfers of bda balances to the companys balance sheet see bank deposit account fees drove growth in schwabs average interestearning assets in the third quarter and first nine months of relative to the same periods in partially offsetting this growth we experienced significant seasonal tax outflows in the second quarter and due to the rapid increases to the federal funds overnight rate changes in client cash allocations increased in the third quarter which resulted in a total decrease in bank deposits and payables to brokerage clients of during the third quarter and since yearend in recent quarters the company increased its cash holdings and reduced the duration of incremental investment securities purchases which has provided flexibility to support such changes in client cash allocations associated with higher shortterm interest rates these steps also help keep schwab positioned to benefit from

services total expenses excluding interest increased by and in the third quarter and first nine months of respectively compared to the same periods in while advisor services total expenses excluding interest increased by and in the third quarter and first nine months of respectively compared to the same periods in both segments saw higher compensation and benefits expenses due to increases in headcount to support our expanding client base annual merit increases as well as a employee salary increase and other targeted compensation adjustments that went into effect in late occupancy and equipment expenses increased in both segments primarily due to an increase in software maintenance and other agreements as well as other technology equipment costs to support growth of the business and the integration of td ameritrade in addition depreciation and amortization increased for both segments primarily due to higher amortization of purchased and internally developed software and higher depreciation of hardware driven by capital expenditures in and the first nine months of to enhance our technological infrastructure to support growth of the business for investor services these increases in the first nine months of compared to the same period in were partially offset by lower other expenses due to a charge of approximately million in the second quarter of for a nowsettled

comprehensive risk management program to identify and manage these risks and their associated potential for financial and reputational impact as part of our ongoing integration of td ameritrade the company has aligned td ameritrades risk management practices with schwabs risk appetite our integration work included evaluating new or changed risks impacting the combined company the charles schwab corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tabular amounts in millions except ratios or as noted and taking action through various means though integration work continues the companys operations inclusive of td ameritrade remain consistent with our enterprise risk management erm framework for a discussion of our risk management programs see part ii item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk management in the form 10k interest rate risk simulations net interest revenue simulation for our net interest revenue sensitivity analysis we use net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates the simulations include all balance sheet interest ratesensitive assets and liabilities key assumptions include the projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors prepayment speeds of mortgagerelated investments repricing of financial instruments and reinvestment of matured or paiddown securities and loans net interest revenue is affected by various factors such as the distribution and composition of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities the spread between yields earned on interestearning assets and rates paid on interestbearing liabilities which may reprice at different times or by different amounts and the spread between short and longterm interest rates interestearning assets include investment securities margin loans bank loans and cash and cash equivalents these assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in prepayment levels that tend to increase in a declining rate environment and decrease in a rising rate environment because we establish the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and bank deposits and the rates charged on certain margin and bank loans and control the composition of our investment securities we have some ability to manage our net interest spread depending on competitive factors and market conditions net interest revenue sensitivity analysis assumes the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates as we actively manage the consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure in all likelihood we would take steps to manage additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment the following table shows the simulated change to net interest revenue over the next months beginning september and december of a gradual basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates at the end of each reporting period september december increase of basis points decrease of basis points the companys simulated increase of basis points in market interest rates had a lower impact on net interest revenue as of september compared to december primarily due to increased sensitivity to the companys higher projected client deposit rates and decreased sensitivity to the companys mortgagebacked investment securities a simulated decrease of basis points in market interest rates had a slightly larger impact on net interest revenue as of september compared to december primarily due to increased sensitivity from a higher allocation to cash and shortterm investments this increased sensitivity was partially offset by higher starting client deposit rates which relative to the december simulation provide greater responsiveness to lower simulated interest rates higher shortterm interest rates would positively impact net interest revenue as yields on interestearning assets are expected to rise faster than the cost of funding sources a decline in interest rates could negatively impact the yield on the companys investment and loan portfolio to a greater degree than any offsetting reduction in interest expense from funding sources compressing net interest margin in addition to measuring the effect of a gradual basis point parallel increase or decrease in current interest rates we regularly simulate the effects of larger parallel and nonparallel shifts in interest rates on net interest revenue the charles schwab corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tabular amounts in millions except ratios or as noted bank deposit account fees simulation consistent with the presentation on the consolidated statement of income the sensitivity of bank deposit account fee revenue to interest rate changes is assessed separately from the net interest revenue simulation described above as of september and december simulated changes in bank deposit account fee revenue from gradual basis point changes in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates did not have a significant impact on the companys total net revenues economic value of equity simulation management also uses economic value of equity eve simulations to measure interest rate risk eve sensitivity measures the longterm impact of interest rate changes on the net present value of assets and liabilities eve is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to hypothetical instantaneous shifts in the level of interest rates this analysis is highly dependent upon asset and liability assumptions based on historical behaviors as well as our expectations of the economic environment key assumptions in our eve calculation include projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors prepayment speeds of mortgagerelated investments term structure models of interest rates nonmaturity deposit behavior and pricing assumptions our net interest revenue bank deposit account fee revenue and eve simulations reflect the assumption of nonnegative investment yields phaseout of libor the company has made significant progress to prepare for the phasingout of libor as described in part ii item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk management in the form 10k and additional transition efforts to prepare for the phasingout of libor are ongoing on march president biden signed the consolidated appropriations act of into law which includes the adjustable interest rate libor act containing legislation related to the transition away from libor this legislation is intended to establish a uniform process for replacing libor in existing contracts and securities that continue after the cessation of libor and do not contain clearly defined or practicable fallback provisions on july the federal reserve board released a proposal that provides default rules for certain contracts that use libor which would implement the libor act with replacement rates based on the secured overnight financing rate sofr the company believes the libor act and the federal reserve boards proposed regulation help provide clarity for the transition of our legacy libor contracts including investment securities loans and preferred stock to alternative reference rates in an orderly manner liquidity risk liquidity risk is the potential

item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting estimates in the form 10k there have been no changes to critical accounting estimates during the first nine months of nongaap financial measures in addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us gaap managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contain references to the nongaap financial measures described below we believe these nongaap financial measures provide useful supplemental information about the financial performance of the company and facilitate meaningful comparison of schwabs results in the current period to both historic and future results these nongaap measures should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap and may not be comparable to nongaap financial measures presented by other companies schwabs use of nongaap measures is reflective of certain adjustments made to gaap financial measures as described below nongaap adjustment or measure definition usefulness to investors and uses by management acquisition and integrationrelated costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets schwab adjusts certain gaap financial measures to exclude the impact of acquisition and integrationrelated costs incurred as a result of the companys acquisitions amortization of acquired intangible assets and where applicable the income tax effect of these expenses adjustments made to exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets are reflective of all acquired intangible assets which were recorded as part of purchase accounting these acquired intangible assets contribute to the companys revenue generation amortization of acquired intangible assets will continue in future periods over their remaining useful lives we exclude acquisition and integrationrelated costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets for the purpose of calculating certain nongaap measures because we believe doing so provides additional transparency of schwabs ongoing operations and is useful in both evaluating the operating performance of the business and facilitating comparison of results with prior and future periods acquisition and integrationrelated costs fluctuate based on the timing of acquisitions and integration activities thereby limiting comparability of results among periods and are not representative of the costs of running the companys ongoing business amortization of acquired intangible assets is excluded because management does not believe it is indicative of the companys underlying operating performance return on tangible common equity return on tangible common equity represents annualized adjusted net income available to common stockholders as a percentage of average tangible common equity tangible common equity represents common equity less goodwill acquired intangible assets net and related deferred tax liabilities acquisitions typically result in the recognition of significant amounts of goodwill and acquired intangible assets we believe return on tangible common equity may be useful to investors as a supplemental measure to facilitate assessing capital efficiency and returns relative to the composition of schwabs balance sheet the company also uses adjusted diluted eps and return on tangible common equity as components of performance criteria for employee bonus and certain executive management incentive compensation arrangements the
