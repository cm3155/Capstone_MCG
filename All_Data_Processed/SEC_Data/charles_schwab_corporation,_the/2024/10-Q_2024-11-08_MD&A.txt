credit market and liquidity risks the company has a comprehensive risk management program to identify and manage these risks and their associated potential for financial and reputational impact for a discussion of our risk management programs see part ii item risk management in the form 10k market risk market risk is the potential for changes in earnings or the value of financial instruments held by schwab as a result of fluctuations in interest rates equity prices or market conditions schwab is exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates within our interestearning assets relative to changes in the costs of funding sources that finance these assets to manage interest rate risk we have established policies and procedures which include setting limits on net interest revenue risk and economic value of equity eve risk to remain within these limits we manage the maturity repricing and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios management monitors established guidelines to stay within the companys risk appetite the company utilizes interest rate swap derivative instruments to assist with managing interest rate risk the effects of which are incorporated into the companys net interest revenue and eve analyses for further information on our interest rate risk management strategies utilizing interest rate swaps see item note net interest revenue simulation for our net interest revenue sensitivity analysis we use net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates the simulations include all balance sheet interest ratesensitive assets and liabilities and include derivative instruments key assumptions include the projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors rates and balances of nonmaturity client cash held on the balance sheet prepayment speeds of mortgagerelated investments repricing of financial instruments and reinvestment of matured or paiddown securities and loans we use independent thirdparty models to simulate net interest revenue sensitivity and related analyses fixed income analytical vendors provide term structure models prepayment speed models for mortgagebacked securities and mortgage loans and cash flow projections based on interest income contractual maturities and prepayments consistent with our policies related to the management of interest rate risk the companys net interest revenue sensitivity analysis primarily involves gradual parallel increasesdecreases in interest rates over a twelvemonth period though we also regularly simulate the effects of nonparallel shifts and instantaneous shifts of interest rates on net interest revenue net interest revenue is affected by various factors such as the distribution and composition of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities the spread between yields earned on interestearning assets and rates paid on interestbearing liabilities which may reprice at different times or by different amounts and the spread between short and longterm interest rates interestearning assets include investment securities margin loans bank loans and cash and cash equivalents these assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in prepayment levels that tend to increase in a declining rate environment and decrease in a rising rate environment because we establish the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash the charles schwab corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tabular amounts in millions except ratios or as noted balances and bank deposits and the rates charged on certain margin and bank loans and control the composition of our investment securities we have some ability to manage our net interest spread depending on competitive factors and market conditions when we have liquidity needs that exceed our primary sources of funding the company has needed to utilize highercost funding sources which can reduce net interest margin and net interest revenue higher prevailing shortterm interest rates generally improve yields on shorter duration interestearning assets during periods of rapidly rising interest rates clients tend to reallocate cash out of sweep products into higheryielding offbalance sheet fixed income investments and money market funds within schwabs product offerings this can result in lower interestearning assets andor may require supplemental funding with higher funding costs which therefore tend to constrain net interest revenue when interest rates are moving rapidly higher a decline in shortterm interest rates could negatively impact the yield on the companys investment and loan portfolios to a greater degree than any offsetting reduction in interest expense from funding sources compressing net interest margin net interest revenue sensitivity analysis assumes the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates while this approach is useful to isolate the impact of changes in interest rates on a staticallysized asset and liability structure it does not capture changes to client cash allocations we conduct simulations on eve to capture the impact of client cash allocation changes on our balance sheet as we actively manage the consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure we have taken and would typically seek to take steps to manage additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment the following table presents simulated changes to net interest revenue over the next months beginning september and december of a gradual increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates at the end of each reporting period september december increase of basis points increase of basis points increase of basis points decrease of basis points decrease of basis points decrease of basis points the companys simulated incremental increases in market interest rates had a largely consistent impact on net interest revenue as of september compared to december the companys simulated incremental decreases in market interest rates had a larger impact on net interest revenue as of september compared to december primarily due to lower nonmaturity deposit rates which reduced interest expense savings in a lower interest rate environment and a decreased allocation to shorterterm liabilities across the companys banking subsidiaries partially offset by lower cash balances effective duration effective duration measures price sensitivity relative to a change in prevailing interest rates taking account of amortizing cash flows and prepayment optionality for mortgagerelated securities and loans duration is measured in years and commonly interpreted as the average timing of principal and interest cash flows we seek to manage the companys asset duration in relation to managements estimate of the companys liability duration the companys liability duration is impacted by the composition of funding sources and typically decreases in periods of rising market interest rates and increases in periods of declining market interest rates the charles schwab corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and

remaining balance sheet assets in aggregate was less than one year as of both september and economic value of equity simulation management also uses eve simulations to measure interest rate risk eve sensitivity measures the longterm impact of interest rate changes on the net present value of assets and liabilities and includes the impact of derivative instruments while eve does not have a direct accounting relationship the measure aims to capture a theoretical value of assets and liabilities under a variety of interest rate environments eve is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to hypothetical instantaneous shifts in the level of interest rates this analysis is highly dependent upon asset and liability assumptions based on historical behaviors key assumptions in our eve calculation include projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors prepayment speeds of mortgagerelated investments term structure models of interest rates behavior of nonmaturity client cash held on the balance sheet and pricing assumptions we use both proprietary and independent thirdparty models to simulate eve sensitivity and related analyses we develop and maintain client credits and deposits runoff models internally based on historical experience and prevailing client cash realignment behaviors we rely on thirdparty models for term structure modeling and prepayment speed modeling for mortgagebacked securities and mortgage loans as interest rates rose in the federal reserves tightening cycle eve sensitivity has generally trended higher due to a shortening of liability duration while the companys asset duration remained largely stable during the period of rising interest rates liability duration shortened significantly and is now consistent with asset duration bank deposit account fees simulation consistent with the presentation on the consolidated statement of income the sensitivity of bank deposit account fee revenue to interest rate changes is assessed separately from the net interest revenue simulation described above as of september and december simulated changes in bank deposit account fee revenue from gradual changes in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates under the interest rate scenarios described above for net interest revenue did not have a significant impact on the companys total net revenues our net interest revenue eve and
