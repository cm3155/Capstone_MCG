item risk factors we face a variety of risks that may affect our operations financial results or stock price and many of those risks are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict the following discussion addresses those risks that management believes are the most significant although there may be other risks that could arise or may prove to be more significant than expected that may affect our operations or financial results for a discussion of our risk management governance and processes including operational risk compliance risk credit risk market risk and liquidity risk see risk management and capital management in part ii item for additional information regarding cybersecurity risk see item cybersecurity economic and market risks developments in the business economic and geopolitical environment could negatively impact our business our business can be adversely affected by the general environment economic corporate securities market regulatory and geopolitical developments all play a role in client asset valuations trading activity interest rates and overall investor engagement and are outside of our control deterioration in the housing and credit markets and decreases in securities valuations negatively impact our results of operations and capital resources the monetary policies of the federal reserve which regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states have a significant effect on our operating results actions taken by the federal reserve including changes in its target funds rate and its own balance sheet management are difficu lt to predict and can affect our financial results including net interest revenue and bank deposit account fees these policies can have implications for clients allocation to cash as we experienced in and and higher or lower client cash balances have an impact on our capital requirements as well as liquidity implications if such changes in allocation are sudden investor sentiment and market and trading dynamics can affect client preferences and security selection and can impact transactions and assetbased revenues the charles schwab corporation a significant change in client cash allocations could negatively impact our income we rely heavily on client cash balances to generate revenue cash awaiting investment in a portion of our client brokerage accounts is swept to our banking subsidiaries and those bank deposits are then used to extend loans to clients and purchase investment securities we also sweep a portion of such cash to the td depository institutions pursuant to the ida agreement through which we earn bank deposit account fees a significant reduction in our clients allocation to cash a change in the allocation of that cash or a transfer of cash away from the company would likely reduce our income as a result of the rapid increases in shortterm interest rates in and the company saw a significant decrease in clients asset allocation to sweep cash and greater client investment in higheryielding alternatives at schwab such as fixed income investments and proprietary purchased money market funds to help facilitate these changes in client cash allocations the company has utilized highercost supplemental funding sources which has negatively impacted the companys net income significant interest rate changes could affect our profitability the direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings a decline in interest rates may have a negative impact on our net interest revenue and our bank deposit account fee revenue the companys interestearning assets include significant holdings of investment securities which include fixed and floatingrate debt securities including substantial holdings of mortgagebacked securities as well as mortgages the company could be adversely affected by a decline in interest rates if the rates that the company earns on interestearning assets decline more than the rates that the company pays on its funding sources or if prepayment rates increase on the mortgages and mortgagebacked securities that the company holds a low interest rate environment may also have a negative impact on our asset management and administration fee revenues when we have to waive a portion of our management fees as we experienced in and for certain schwabsponsored money market mutual funds in order to continue providing a positive return to clients a decline in interest rates may also negatively impact our bank deposit account fee revenue which is earned primarily pursuant to the ida agreement a rise in interest rates may cause our funding costs to increase if market conditions or the competitive environment induces us to raise our interest rates to avoid losing deposits or replace deposits with highercost funding sources without offsetting increases in yields on interestearning assets which can reduce the benefit of higher market interest rates to our net interest revenue as we experienced in and the rapid increases in market interest rates recently experienced have also contributed to increased unrealized losses on our investment securities portfolios increased unrealized losses on investment securities or other assets on our balance sheet can reduce market or client confidence in us which could limit our ability to attract new client assets and accounts or result in the transfer of client assets and accounts from the company a rise in interest rates may also reduce our bank deposit account fee revenue as clients may reallocate assets out of bank deposit account balances and into higheryielding investment alternatives as we experienced in and the ida agreement involves certain commitments including the maintenance of prescribed minimum and maximum ida balances that limit our ability to respond to changes in interest rates and may impact our profitability and bank deposit account fee revenue the bank deposit account fee revenue that we earn related to the ida agreement may be less than the net interest revenue that we could have earned if the deposit balances were swept to our banking subsidiaries rather than the td depository institutions when we are permitted to reduce the ida balances we can only move the balances to our banking subsidiaries if we have sufficient capital problems encountered by other financial institutions and responsive measures to manage such problems could adversely affect financial markets generally could have an adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations and have indirect adverse effects on us concerns regarding the soundness or creditworthiness of other financial institutions can cause substantial disruption within the financial markets and have negative impacts for us and our industry including reductions in availability of liquidity higher borrowing costs and higher costs of capital such concerns regarding one or more financial institutions may also advance public concerns regarding schwab or the financial services industry more broadly which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition even if underlying matters impacting other financial institutions are of limited or no direct applicability to us financial institutions are interrelated through trading clearing or other relationships and as a result concerns about the financial condition of one or more institutions could lead to significant marketwide liquidity and credit problems losses or defaults by other institutions this risk may adversely affect financial intermediaries such as brokerdealers banks clearing houses securities exchanges market makers and others with which we interact on a daily basis and therefore could adversely affect us the charles schwab corporation events affecting the financial services industry may also result in potentially adverse changes to laws or regulations governing banks and savings and loan holding companies or result in the imposition of restrictions through supervisory or enforcement activities including higher capital or liquidity requirements which could have a material impact on our business following the failure of several us banks in the us federal banking agencies proposed rules that would significantly impact our regulatory capital requirements including requiring us to include aoci in regulatory capital as well as rules that would require minimum levels of eligible longterm debt at csc and our banking subsidiaries as a result of increased regulatory expectations regarding capital requirements applicable to the company we have been taking and continue to take measures to increase our capital including the cessation of share repurchases in addition the cost of resolving the recent bank failures has resulted in increased fdic costs and may prompt the fdic to further increase its premiums or to issue additional special assessments which could have a material negative impact on our profitability and our business liquidity risk a significant decrease in our liquidity could negatively affect our business as well as reduce client confidence in us maintaining adequate liquidity is crucial to our business operations including transaction settlement custody requirements and lending commitments among other liquidity needs we meet our liquidity needs primarily from working capital and cash generated by client activity as well as external financing fluctuations in client cash or deposit balances as well as market conditions or changes in regulatory treatment of client deposits may affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs a reduction in our liquidity position could reduce client confidence in us which could result in the transfer out of client assets and accounts or could cause us to fail to satisfy our liquidity requirements including the lcr in addition if our brokerdealer or depository institution subsidiaries fail to meet regulatory capital guidelines or if a depository institution subsidiary is unable to obtain regulatory approval when required to declare a dividend regulators could limit the subsidiaries ability to upstream funds to csc or limit their operations which could reduce cscs liquidity and adversely affect its ability to repay debt pay dividends on cscs preferred stock and common stock repurchase its shares or redeem its preferred stock in addition csc may need to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries factors which may adversely affect our liquidity position include csco and tdac having temporary liquidity demands due to timing differences between brokerage transaction settlements and the availability of segregated cash balances fluctuations in cash held in banking or brokerage client accounts such as the significant client reallocation from sweep cash to higheryielding investments that we experienced in and in response to rapid interest rate increases a dramatic increase in our lending activities including margin mortgagerelated and personal lending increased capital requirements changes in regulatory guidance or interpretations other regulatory changes or a loss of market or client confidence in us resulting in unanticipated withdrawals of client funds as a member firm of securities and derivatives clearing houses we are required to deposit cash stock andor government securities for margin requirements and to clearing funds the margin requirements may fluctuate significantly from time to time based upon the nature and size of clients trading activity and market volatility and member firms like us have been required to deposit additional funds clearing houses could also require additional funds from member firms if a clearing member defaults on its obligations to the clearing house in an amount larger than its own margin and clearing fund deposits when available cash is not sufficient for our liquidity needs we may be required to seek external financing during periods of disruptions in the credit and capital markets potential sources of external financing could be reduced and borrowing costs could increase although csc csco and tdac maintain uncommitted unsecured bank credit lines and csc has a commercial paper issuance program as well as a universal shelf registration statement filed with the sec which can be used to sell securities financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all due to market conditions or disruptions in the credit markets in addition a downgrade in the companys credit ratings could increase its borrowing costs and limit its access to the capital markets when shortterm interest rates rapidly increase as they did in and client movement of certain cash balances out of our sweep features and into higheryielding alternatives generally increases when these outflows outpace excess cash on hand and cash generated by maturities and paydowns on our investment and loan portfolios as they did in and we may need to rely on temporary supplemental funding such as advances under federal home loan bank fhlb secured credit facilities borrowings under repurchase agreements with external financial institutions issuances of brokered certificates of deposit cds or other sources of funding which have higher costs and could be subject to limitations on availability in addition to access new fhlb advances or roll over existing advances our banking subsidiaries must maintain positive tangible capital as defined by the federal housing finance agency larger unrealized losses on our available for sale afs portfolio due to higher market interest rates negatively impact our capital position inclusive of aoci including our tangible capital the charles schwab corporation compliance risks extensive regulatory supervision of our businesses may subject us to significant penalties or limitations on business activities as a participant in the securities banking and financial services industries we are subject to extensive regulation under federal state and foreign laws by governmental agencies supervisory authorities and sros the costs and uncertainty related to complying with such regulations continue to increase these regulations affect our business operations and impose capital client prote ction and market conduct requirements on us as well as restrictions on the activities that we are allowed to conduct we become subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny as we grow regulators have broad discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies and could prevent us from pursuing our business strategy regulators could also limit our ability to grow including adding assets launching new products making acquisitions and undertaking strategic investments our banking regulators could require csc andor our banking subsidiaries to hold more capital increase liquidity or limit their ability to pay dividends or cscs ability to repurchase or redeem shares despite our efforts to comply with applicable legal requirements there are a number of risks particularly in areas where applicable laws or regulations may be unclear or where regulators could revise their previous guidance any enforcement actions or other proceedings brought by our regulators against us or our affiliates officers or employees could result in fines penalties cease and desist orders enforcement actions suspension disqualification or expulsion or other disciplinary sanctions including limitations on our business activities any of which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition while we maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations violations could occur in addition some legalregulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though systems and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations were in place at the time there may be other negative consequences resulting from a finding of noncompliance including restrictions on certain activities such a finding may also damage our reputation and our relationships with our regulators and could restrict the ability of institutional investment managers to invest in our securities legislation or changes in rules and regulations could negatively affect our business and financial results new legislation rules regulations and guidance or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing federal state foreign and sro rules regulations and guidance including changes relating to mutual funds money market funds standards of conduct with clients conflicts of interest regulatory treatment of deposit accounts cra changes in required minimum capital and capital structure and changes in equity market structure including rules relating to order routing and orderrelated revenues may directly affect our operations and profitability or our specific business lines recently the sec has proposed or adopted a number of new rules and these new or proposed rules involve sweeping changes that could require significant shifts in industry operations and practices thereby increasing uncertainty for markets and investors the us federal banking agencies have recently proposed rules regarding regulatory capital and longterm debt and compliance with these proposed rules may result in increased costs and reduce our net income in addition the us department of labor recently proposed rules to significantly broaden the definition of fiduciary under the employee retirement income security act of which among other requirements would subject brokerdealers who provide nondiscretionary investment advice to retirement plans to a best interest standard our profitability could also be affected by rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities generally including changes to the laws governing taxation electronic commerce client privacy and security of client data in addition the rules and regulations could result in limitations on the lines of business we conduct modifications to our business practices more stringent capital and liquidity requirements increased deposit insurance assessments or additional costs and could limit our ability to return capital to stockholders these changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes to our compliance risk management treasury and operations functions failure to meet capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines could affect our financial condition csc together with its banking brokerdealer and fcmfdm subsidiaries must meet certain capital and liquidity standards subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about the adequacy of our capital and our internal assessment of our capital needs the uniform net capital rule limits the ability of our brokerdealer entities to transfer capital to csc and other affiliates new regulatory capital liquidity capital planning and stress testing requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital including paying dividends stock repurchases and redemptions and may require us to increase our capital andor liquidity or to limit our growth failure by either csc or its banking subsidiaries to meet minimum capital requirements could the charles schwab corporation result in certain mandatory and additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could have a negative impact on us in addition failure by csc or our banking subsidiaries to maintain a sufficient amount of capital to satisfy their stress capital buffer csc or capital conservation buffer banking subsidiaries and countercyclical capital buffer requirements would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions and discretionary cash bonus payments to executive officers any requirement that we increase our regulatory capital replace certain capital instruments which presently qualify as tier capital or increase regulatory capital ratios or liquidity could require us to liquidate assets deleverage or otherwise change our business andor investment plans which may adversely affect our financial results issuing additional common stock would dilute the ownership of existing stockholders csc is subject to the ccar process which requires submission of an annual capital plan and determination of cscs stress capital buffer the plan must include a description of all planned capital actions including dividends or stock repurchases over a ninequarter planning horizon beginning with the first quarter of the calendar year the capital plan is submitted cscs riskbased capital ratios must exceed the regulatory minimum plus the stress capital buffer the stress capital buffer could make us subject to progressively more stringent constraints on capital actions if we approach our minimum ratios this could lead to restrictions on our ability to pay or increase dividends or otherwise return capital to stockholders if the average of cscs total consolidated assets for four consecutive calendar quarters reaches billion or if the average of crossjurisdictional activity for four consecutive calendar quarters reaches billion csc will become subject to more stringent category ii requirements including annual stress testing the advanced approaches framework and the inability to opt out of including aoci in regulatory capital calculations at december csc had approximately billion in total assets and crossjurisdictional activity of approximately billion see also part ii item current regulatory and other developments for discussion of regulatory proposals that could among other things require the company to include aoci in its regulatory capital calculations we are subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings and may not be successful in defending against claims or proceedings the financial services industry faces significant litigation and regulatory risks we are subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business including arbitrations class actions and other litigation some of which include claims for substantial or unspecified damages we are also the subject of inquiries investigations and proceedings by regulatory and other governmental agencies litigation and arbitration claims include those brought by our clients and the clients of thirdparty advisors whose assets are custodied with us claims from clients of thirdparty advisors may allege losses due to investment decisions made by the thirdparty advisors or the advisors misconduct litigation claims also include claims from third parties alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights eg patents such litigation can require the expenditure of significant company resources if we were found to have infringed on a thirdparty patent or other intellectual property rights we could incur substantial damages and in some circumstances could be enjoined from using certain technology or providing certain products or services actions brought against us may result in settlements awards injunctions fines penalties or other results adverse to us including reputational harm even if we are successful in defending against these actions the defense of such matters may result in us incurring significant expenses we may also determine that it is in the companys best interests to settle a matter such as to avoid protracted litigation even though the company may have strong defenses a substantial judgment settlement fine or penalty could be material to our operating results or cash flows for a particular future period depending on our results for that period in market downturns and periods of heightened volatility the volume of legal claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services companies have historically increased operational risk security breaches of our systems or those of our clients or third parties may subject us to significant liability and damage our reputation our business involves the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential information about our clients and us information security risks for financial institutions are increasing in part because of the use of the internet and mobile and cloud technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities including the use of artificial intelligence technologies of organized crime activists hackers and other external parties including foreign state actors our systems and those of other financial institutions as well as those of our thirdparty service providers have been and will continue to be the target of cyber attacks malicious code computer viruses ransomware and denial of service attacks that could the charles schwab corporation result in unauthorized access misuse loss or destruction of data including confidential client information account takeovers unavailability of service or other events despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems we may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources data security breaches may also result from nontechnical means for example employee misconduct given the high volume of transactions that we process the large number of clients counterparties and thirdparty service providers with which we do business including cloud service providers and the increasing sophistication of cyber attacks a cyber attack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected the extent of a particular cyber attack and the steps we may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear and it may take a significant amount of time before an investigation is completed and full and reliable information about the attack is known during such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated all or any of which would further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack security breaches including breaches of our security measures or those of our thirdparty service providers or clients could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws and could subject us to significant liability or loss that may not be covered by insurance actions by our regulators damage to our reputation or a loss of confidence in our security measures which could harm our business we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures we may also be required to pay ransom to threat actors to restore or prevent dissemination of data we also face risk related to external fraud involving the misappropriation and use of clients user names passwords or other personal information to gain access to our clients financial accounts this could occur from the compromise of clients personal electronic devices or as a result of a data security breach at an unrelated company where clients personal information is taken and then made available to fraudsters additionally data exposure can result from a failure to adequately destroy data during system or asset decommissioning which might result in client or company information being made available to external parties in error such risks have grown in recent years due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime and other external parties including foreign statesponsored parties losses reimbursed to clients under our guarantee against unauthorized account activity could have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations technology and operational failures or errors and other operational risks could subject us to losses litigation regulatory actions and reputational damage we must process record and monitor a large number of transactions and our operations are highly dependent on the integrity of our technology systems and our ability to make timely enhancements and additions to our systems system interruptions errors or downtime can result from a variety of causes including changes in client use patterns technological failure changes to our systems linkages with thirdparty systems and power failures and can have a significant impact on our business and operations our systems are vulnerable to disruptions from human error execution errors errors in models such as those used for asset management capital planning and management risk management stress testing and compliance employee misconduct unauthorized trading external fraud computer viruses distributed denial of service attacks cyber attacks terrorist attacks natural disaster extreme weather power outage capacity constraints software flaws events impacting key business partners and vendors and similar events for example we and other financial institutions have been the target of various denial of service attacks that have in certain circumstances made websites mobile applications and email unavailable for periods of time cloud technologies are critical to the operation of our systems and platforms and our reliance on cloud technologies is growing cloud service disruptions may lead to delays in accessing data that is important to our businesses and may hinder our clients access to our platforms it could take an extended period of time to restore full functionality to our technology or other operating systems in the event of an unforeseen occurrence which could affect our ability to process and settle client transactions despite our efforts to identify areas of risk oversee operational areas involving risk and implement policies and procedures designed to manage these risks there can be no assurance that we will not suffer unexpected losses reputational damage or regulatory action due to technology or other operational failures or errors including those of our vendors or other third parties while we devote substantial attention and resources to the reliability capacity and scalability of our systems we occasionally experience extraordinary trading volumes which have caused and could cause our computer systems to operate at unacceptably slow speeds or even fail affecting our ability to process client transactions and potentially resulting in some clients orders being executed at prices they did not anticipate disruptions in service and slower system response times could result in substantial losses decreased client satisfaction reputational damage and regulatory inquiries we are also dependent on the integrity and performance of securities exchanges clearing houses market makers dealers and other intermediaries to which client orders are the charles schwab corporation routed for execution and settlement system failures and constraints and transaction errors at such intermediaries could result in delays and erroneous or unanticipated execution prices and cancelled orders cause substantial losses for us and for our clients and subject us to claims from our clients for damages and cause reputational harm certain events could increase our client service and processing times due to staffing shortages remote work or the temporary loss of services from outsourced service providers such as occurred during the covid19 pandemic we consider service quality to be an important part of the client experience and our failure to meet client expectations could result in decreased client satisfaction we take steps to prevent and detect fraud but the ways that fraudulent activity is attempted is continuously evolving although we monitor for new types of fraud there may be a delay in recognizing the fraud is happening besides potential losses shutting down fraudulent activity often requires a balance with client experience instances of fraud might negatively impact our reputation and client confidence in the company in addition to any direct losses that might result from such instances our investment management operations may subject us to fiduciary or other legal liability for client losses fund and trust management and administration are complex activities and include functions such as recordkeeping and accounting security pricing corporate actions compliance with investment restrictions daily net asset value computations account reconciliations and required distributions to fund shareholders failure to properly perform operational tasks or the misrepresentation of our services and products could subject us to regulatory sanctions penalties or litigation and result in reputational damage liability to clients and the termination of investment management or administration agreements and the withdrawal of assets under our management in the management and administration of funds and client accounts we use quantitative models and other tools and resources to support investment decisions and processes including those related to risk assessment portfolio management trading and hedging activities and product valuations errors in the design function or underlying assumptions used in these models and tools particularly if we fail to detect the errors over an extended period could subject us to claims of a breach of fiduciary duty and potentially large liabilities for makewhole payments litigation andor regulatory fines we rely on outsourced service providers to perform key functions we rely on external service providers to perform certain key technology cloud infrastructure processing servicing and support functions these service providers face technology operating business and economic risks and any significant failures by them including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client employee or company information could cause us to incur losses and could harm our reputation an interruption in or the cessation of service by any external service provider as a result of systems failures capacity constraints financial difficulties natural disasters extreme weather power outage public health crises political developments war international disputes or for any other reason and our inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner could disrupt our operations impact our ability to offer certain products and services and result in financial losses to us we temporarily lost the services from some of our outsourced service providers during the covid19 pandemic which contributed to increased client service response and processing times following russias invasion of ukraine we had to replace certain vendor resources which added incremental complexity in earlier phases of our td ameritrade conversion work switching to an alternative service provider may require a transition period and result in less efficient operations we rely on financial intermediaries to execute and settle client orders and transactions with financial intermediaries are a significant source of revenue we rely on market makers dealers securities exchanges clearing houses and other financial intermediaries to execute and settle our clients orders in addition payments received from market makers and exchanges in connection with the execution of client equity and options trades and from dealers and other counterparties in connection with securities lending account for significant revenue the unwillingness or inability of any of these parties to perform their usual functions coupled with the unavailability of alternative arrangements could result in our clients orders not getting executed or settled this may be due to market volatility uneconomic trading conditions capacity constraints financial constraints system failures unanticipated trading halts invoked by securities exchanges market closures or other reasons our inability to get client orders executed or settled because of the unwillingness or inability of these parties to perform their usual functions could result in client dissatisfaction and reputational harm and expose us to client claims for damages the charles schwab corporation credit risk we may suffer significant losses from our credit exposures our businesses are subject to the risk that a client counterparty or issuer will fail to perform its contractual obligations or that the value of collateral held to secure obligations will prove to be inadequate while we have policies and procedures designed to manage this risk the policies and procedures may not be fully effective our exposure mainly results from margin lending clients options and futures trading securities lending mortgage lending pledged asset lending our role as a counterparty in financial contracts and investing activities and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the proprietary funds that the company sponsors when clients purchase securities on margin borrow on lines of credit collateralized by securities or trade options or futures we are subject to the risk that clients may default on their obligations when the value of the securities and cash in their accounts falls below the amount of clients indebtedness our margin options and futures business has materially increased as a result of our td ameritrade acquisition and market liquidity represents an increased risk abrupt changes in securities valuations and the failure of clients to meet margin calls could result in substantial losses especially if there is a lack of liquidity we have exposure to credit risk associated with our investments those investments are subject to price fluctuations loss of value of securities can negatively affect earnings if management determines that such loss of value has resulted from a credit loss the evaluation of whether a credit loss exists is a matter of judgment which includes the assessment of multiple factors if management determines that a securitys decline in fair value is the result of a credit loss an allowance for credit losses on the security will be recorded and a corresponding loss will be recognized in current earnings even if a decline in fair value of a security is not determined to have resulted from a credit loss if we were ever forced to sell the security sooner than intended prior to maturity due to liquidity needs we would have to recognize any unrealized losses at that time our bank loans primarily consist of first mortgages pals and helocs increases in delinquency and default rates housing and stock price declines increases in the unemployment rate and other economic factors can result in increases in allowances for credit losses and related credit loss expense as well as write downs on such loans heightened credit exposures to specific counterparties or instruments can increase our risk of loss examples include large positions in financial instruments collateralized by assets with similar economic characteristics or in securities of a single issuer or industry mortgage loans and helocs to banking clients which are secured by properties in the same geographic region and client margins options or futures pledged assets and securities lending activities collateralized by or linked to securities of a single issuer index or industry the company sponsors a number of proprietary money market mutual funds and other proprietary funds although the company has no obligation to do so the company may decide for competitive or other reasons to provide credit liquidity or other support to our funds in the event of significant declines in valuation of fund holdings or significant redemption activity that exceeds available liquidity such support could cause the company to take significant charges could reduce the companys liquidity and in certain situations could with respect to proprietary funds other than money market mutual funds result in the company having to consolidate one or more funds in its financial statements if the company were to choose not to provide credit liquidity or other support in such a situation the company could suffer reputational damage and its business could be adversely affected risks related to our td ameritrade integration we are working to complete one of the largest brokerage account conversions and could experience unanticipated issues as part of our integration of td ameritrade the company expects to complete the remaining client transitions from td ameritrade to schwab in a final transition group in may of this final transition group includes our most active trader accounts which drive significant revenue for td ameritrade and are therefore important to the revenue of the combined company although we have undertaken extensive planning and testing the account transitions are complicated and we could experience issues which cause the final transition group or the remaining integration work to be delayed or negatively impact the client experience such issues could adversely impact client retention integrationrelated costs the timing for realizing synergies including those dependent on the winddown of the operations of the td ameritrade brokerdealers our reputation and compliance with regulatory requirements the charles schwab corporation we have experienced unanticipated issues earlier in the integration process that added complexity to our conversion work including a need to increase capacity of our systems earlier in the integration process beyond our original technology buildout plan and other complexities of technology development though technology development to support the remaining client account transitions is now substantially complete unanticipated issues could arise including in relation to the winddown of certain technology used by our brokerdealer subsidiaries in connection with the completed transitions the company experienced attrition in client assets from former td ameritrade retail accounts and rias that was within our initial estimates when we announced the acquisition it is possible that the remaining integration process could result in the loss of clients including to a greater degree than previously planned or experienced in relation to the client account conversions we expect to continue to incur significant costs in to finish combining the operations of schwab and td ameritrade including workforce technologyrelated and facilities consolidation costs additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration process if we are not able to successfully transition the remaining client accounts and complete planned technology winddown activities within the anticipated time frames the anticipated cost savings and other benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected other business risks potential strategic transactions could have a negative impact on our financial position we evaluate potential strategic transactions including business combinations acquisitions and dispositions any such transaction could have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows the process of evaluating negotiating effecting and integrating any such strategic transaction may divert managements attention from other business concerns and might cause the loss of key clients employees and business partners moreover integrating businesses and systems may result in unforeseen expenditures as well as numerous risks and uncertainties including the need to integrate operational financial and management information systems and management controls integrate relationships with clients and business partners and manage facilities and employees in different geographic areas the integration process could result in the disruption of ongoing businesses or changes to inconsistent standards controls procedures and policies that could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients employees outsourced service providers and vendors in addition an acquisition may cause us to assume liabilities or become subject to litigation or regulatory proceedings or require the amortization of a large amount of acquired intangible assets further we may not realize the anticipated benefits from an acquisition including without limitation the acquisition of td ameritrade in a timely manner or at all and any future acquisition could be dilutive to our current stockholders percentage ownership or to earnings per common share eps our acquisitions and dispositions are typically subject to closing conditions including regulatory approvals and the absence of material adverse changes in the business operations or financial condition of the entity or part of an entity being acquired or sold to the extent we enter into an agreement to buy or sell an entity or part of an entity there can be no guarantee that the transaction will close when expected or at all if a material transaction does not close our stock price could decline our industry is highly competitive and characterized by aggressive price competition we operate in a highly competitive environment with a broad array of competitors from large integrated banks to venturecapital backed private companies we continually monitor our pricing in relation to competitors and periodically adjust interest rates on deposits and loans fees for advisory services expense ratios on mutual funds and etfs trade commission rates and other pricing and incentives to sustain our competitive position increased price competition from other financial services firms to attract clients such as reduced commissions higher deposit rates reduced mutual fund or etf expense ratios or the increased use of incentives could impact our results of operations and financial condition we face competition in hiring and retaining qualified employees the market for qualified personnel in our business is highly competitive at various times different functions and roles are in especially high demand in the market compelling us to pay more to attract talent our ability to continue to compete effectively will depend upon our ability to attract new employees and retain existing employees while managing compensation costs the charles schwab corporation our stock price has fluctuated historically and may continue to fluctuate our stock price can be volatile among the factors that may affect the volatility of our stock price are the following speculation in the investment community or the press about or actual changes in our competitive position organizational structure executive team operations financial condition financial reporting and results expense discipline strategic transactions the expected benefits from our td ameritrade acquisition or ratings from third parties the announcement of new products services acquisitions or dispositions by us or our competitors increases or decreases in revenue or earnings changes in earnings estimates by the investment community and variations between estimated financial results and actual financial results business metrics such as client cash and net new client assets and sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by large stockholders changes in the stock market generally or as it concerns our industry as well as geopolitical corporate regulatory business and economic factors may also affect our stock price future sales of cscs equity securities may adversely affect the market price of cscs common stock and result in dilution cscs certificate of incorporation authorizes cscs board of directors among other things to issue additional shares of common or preferred stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into equity securities without stockholder approval csc may issue additional equity or convertible securities to raise additional capital or for other purposes the issuance of any additional equity or convertible securities could be substantially dilutive to holders of cscs common stock and may adversely affect the market price of cscs common stock our ongoing relationships with the torontodominion bank and its affiliates could have a negative impact on us although our acquisition of td ameritrade was structured such that completion of the merger would not result in csc either i being deemed to be controlled as that term is interpreted by the federal reserve under the bhc act or hola by the torontodominion bank td bank or ii being deemed to be in control of any of td banks depository institutions changes in circumstances could trigger presumptions of control under the federal reserves regulations this could occur if td bank and its affiliates own more than of schwab common stock as interpreted in accordance with the applicable rules of the federal reserve while the stockholder agreement between csc and td bank prohibits td bank and its affiliates from exceeding the threshold it could happen unintentionally this presumption of control could also be triggered if the revenue generated to either us or to any of the td bank depository institutions exceeds a certain percentage the stockholder agreement contains provisions to address such situations
