item risk factors there are no material changes from any of the risk factors previously disclosed in pncs form 10k in response to part i item other than the addition of the following risk factor the recent outbreak of the novel strain of coronavirus covid19 had and is likely to continue to have an adverse effect possibly materially on our overall business and financial performance in december an outbreak of covid19 occurred in china which has subsequently spread throughout many regions of the world including the us on march the world health organization declared covid19 a global pandemic and recommended worldwide containment and mitigation measures on march 13th president trump announced a national emergency relating to the virus federal state and local governments and their respective agencies have enacted and are expected to continue to enact and implement a variety of measures to manage the public health effects including restricting travel ordering the closure of nonessential businesses and prohibiting individual interactions through required social distancing measures and mandatory stay at home orders collectively these measures together with voluntary changes in behavior have led to a substantial decrease in economic activity and a dramatic increase in unemployment sectors such as retail hospitality travel shipping consumer services elective healthcare and oil and gas have been particularly hard hit governmental bodies have also enacted and are expected to continue to enact and implement laws designed to stabilize the economy and provide relief to businesses and individuals to mitigate the consequences of covid19 and the policies restricting the operation of businesses and the movement of individuals the effectiveness of these efforts is uncertain and we cannot predict future developments including how long the outbreak and related restrictions will last which geographical regions may be particularly affected or what other government responses may occur the outbreak and its consequences including responsive measures to manage it had and are likely to continue to have an adverse effect possibly materially on our overall business and financial performance the longer the public health crisis lasts and the greater its severity the greater the likely adverse impact on the economy our customers and our business and financial performance the following are examples of the most likely impacts on pnc the deterioration of national and global economic conditions substantial increases in unemployment and associated turmoil and volatility in the financial markets has negatively affected and is likely to continue to negatively affect possibly materially our financial performance and capital and liquidity the following are the key factors contributing to this risk there is a greater likelihood that more of our commercial and consumer customers or counterparties will become delinquent on their loans or other obligations to us which in turn will result in a higher level of nonperforming loans and net chargeoffs it will result in a higher and more volatile provision for credit losses for financial instruments held by us that are subject to cecl even if a loan returns to full performing status it may be on modified terms that result in for example a term extension interest rate reduction or principal deferral or forgiveness increases in loan delinquencies or modifications will also result in increased administrative costs there has been and there is likely to continue to be a decrease in the demand for certain of our products and services these rapidly changing and unprecedented market conditions have impacted and are likely to continue to impact the valuation of assets as reported within our consolidated financial statements as well as causing substantial reductions in the value of our assets under management all with the possible effects described in item of our form the pnc financial services group inc form 10q k in the risk factor headed our business and financial performance are vulnerable to the impact of changes in the values of financial assets although pncs capital and liquidity continue to be strong these conditions also have and are likely to continue to negatively affect our capital and liquidity positions possibly materially which are critical to our ability to operate and grow our business in addition continued or accelerated disruption and volatility in the financial markets or longlasting or deeper recessionary conditions may diminish our access to the capital markets we have suspended our discretionary common share repurchase program and may take further actions that would limit a return of capital to shareholders including potentially a reduction or suspension of the dividend payable to common shareholders as a result of these conditions and their effect on our financial performance and position or as a result of regulatory guidance some of the legislation responsive to the outbreak including the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act provides for certain commercial and consumer protections which are likely to alter the profitability of the transactions in which we engage such as by allowing borrowers to delay payments on loans or other obligations to us and imposing other costs on us these laws are also likely to delay or restrict our ability to realize the value of collateral by for example providing temporary foreclosure protection and eviction protection even when a customer is in breach of its obligations to us we may also be limited in our ability to realize the value of collateral as a result of court closures and related delays moreover collateral may be liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of exposure to us as a result of deteriorating economic conditions and volatile markets see recent regulatory developments in this report for more information on pncs implementation of these programs other laws related to employee benefits and the treatment of employees could also negatively impact us by increasing administrative compensation and benefits costs by for example mandating coverage of certain covid19 related testing and treatment or mandating additional paid or unpaid leave further governmental action that is taken to mitigate the economic effects of the pandemic as well as additional compensation or benefit actions taken by pnc could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations possibly materially in other ways that are not known now in response to the outbreak and its economic consequences the federal reserve lowered its target for the federal funds rate to a range of to as a result of the high percentage of our assets and liabilities that are in the form of interestbearing or interestrelated instruments this change in interest rates will have a negative impact on our net interest income and net interest margin which could be material and which could materially adversely affect our profitability the possible effects of a low interest rate environment are further described in item of our form 10k in the risk factor headed our business and financial performance are impacted significantly by market interest rates and movements in those rates moreover such low rates increase the risk in the us of a negative interest rate environment in which interest rates drop below zero either broadly or for some types of instruments for example yields on onemonth and threemonth treasuries briefly dropped below zero in march such an occurrence would likely further reduce the interest we earn on loans and other earning assets while also likely requiring us to pay to maintain our deposits with the federal reserve bank our systems may not be able to handle adequately a negative interest rate environment and not all variable rate instruments are designed for such a circumstance we cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary policies in response to the outbreak or the precise effects that they may have on our activities and financial results to protect our employees customers and the communities in which we operate we have modified the operations of many of our retail branches including temporarily closing some branches and have otherwise implemented workfromhome policies for a significant portion of our workforce we believe we are capable of meeting the needs of our customers despite these modifications however these efforts may result in the loss of customers impede our ability to perform certain transactions and impair our ability to effectively identify manage and control risk for example customers may be unwilling or unable to conduct transactions with us via online channels or through a local branch that is operating only in a drivethrough mode another example is the infrastructure needed to provide products and services via online channels or to work effectively in a workfromhome environment such as internet telecommunications and internal information technology systems may fail to perform as anticipated resulting in our inability to deliver products or services or effectively manage the risks arising from our businesses in addition we rely on our employees third party vendors and service providers and other counterparties both domestically and abroad to support many aspects of our business reduced workforces which may be caused by but not limited to illness quarantine stay at home or other government mandates or difficulties transitioning back to an in office environment could result in an adverse impact to our operations and financial performance redeployment of employees from current positions and of technology from current uses to support products and services responsive to the outbreak may further adversely impact our operations further third party vendors service providers and other counterparties both domestically and abroad face access connectivity or other challenges operating within a workfromhome virtual environment the pnc financial services group inc form 10q in support of our employees customers and communities we may take steps beyond or in addition to those required by governmental or regulatory minimums which may further adversely impact our profitability for example we have and may continue to provide additional relief or forbearance to customers health and wellness benefits to employees or financial support for community initiatives to assist those in need as a result of the outbreak the actual or perceived failure to provide sufficient services support or relief to those businesses or individuals in need or properly implement legislation responsive to the outbreak or our voluntary commitments to regulators could negatively impact our reputation with adverse consequences to our business in addition such actual or perceived failure or operational and other issues that arise in connection with the implementation of governmentmandated or other financial assistance or relief programs present elevated levels of legal and reputational risk including the potential for governmental and regulatory inquiries investigations and enforcement actions as well as private lawsuits participation by pnc in governmental programs designed to provide liquidity to the financial system or impacted businesses such as borrowing through the federal reserve discount window or borrowing from or selling financial assets to facilities established by the federal reserve or participation in programs under the cares act also could expose us to governmental or public scrutiny and criticism either at the time we participate in the program or subsequently you should also review our risk factors discussion in item of our form 10k for information regarding other factors that have and are likely to continue to affect our business and financial performance as a result of the pandemic
