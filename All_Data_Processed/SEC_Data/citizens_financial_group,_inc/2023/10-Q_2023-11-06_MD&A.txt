proposed rulemaking that would impose special assessments to recover the loss to the deposit insurance fund dif arising from the protection of uninsured depositors in connection with the systemic risk determination announced on march following the closures of svb and signature bank as required by the federal deposit insurance act under the proposal the special assessment would be levied on the insured depository institutions idi assessment base which would be equal to estimated uninsured deposits as reported on the idis december call report excluding the first billion in estimated uninsured deposits the special assessment would be imposed at an annual rate of approximately basis points and would be collected over eight quarterly assessment periods beginning with the first quarter of the fdics initial estimate of the loss attributable to this systemic risk determination was billion this estimate will be periodically adjusted as assets are sold liabilities are satisfied and receivership expenses are incurred the fdic would cease collection of special assessments before the end of the initial eightquarter collection period if they expect the loss to be less than expected assessment collections the fdic also reserves the right to extend the collection period if there is a shortfall in the amount collected relative to the estimated or actual loss based on the proposed rulemaking and related accounting guidance the special assessment would impact our noninterest expense by approximately million upon adoption this amount is subject to final rulemaking by the fdic and associated revisions if any relative to the application andor levy of the special assessment on idis including the eventual loss to the dif should it differ from the fdics estimate citizens financial group inc proposed regulatory capital revisions on july the frb fdic and occ issued a proposal to implement the basel committee on banking supervisions finalization of the postcrisis bank regulatory capital reforms the proposal commonly referred to as basel iii endgame would significantly revise the capital requirements applicable to large banking organizations with total assets of billion or more including the company under the proposal category iii and iv firms including the company as a category iv firm would become subject to the same capital treatment regarding the inclusion of aoci deductions and rules for minority interest as category i and ii firms the proposal would also replace the existing modelsbased approaches for credit and operational risk which currently apply only to category i and ii firms with two new approaches applicable to category firms i through iv the first would use the existing standardized approach and a proposed revised market risk capital rule the second would use a new expanded riskbased approach which consists of new nonmodelsbased approaches for credit risk operational risk and credit valuation adjustment risk as well as the proposed revised market risk capital rule the approach resulting in the lower ratio would establish the binding ratio for purposes of satisfying regulatory capital requirements and buffers including the scb category iii and iv firms would also be required to calculate counterparty credit exposure relating to derivatives transactions using the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk additionally category iv firms would become subject to the supplementary leverage ratio and the countercyclical capital buffer the proposal provides for a july effective date subject to a threeyear transition period if the rule is adopted as proposed the company estimates as of september a pro forma cet1 ratio of adjusted for the aoci optout removal in addition the basel iii endgame proposal is estimated to modestly increase rwa on a fully phasedin basis comments on the proposal are due by january we continue to evaluate the full impact of the proposal aoci impact on regulatory capital under the current applicable regulatory capital rules we have made the aoci optout election which enables us to exclude components of aoci from regulatory capital as noted above the regulatory agencies are

holding companies and idis with total assets of billion or more including the company and cbna to maintain a minimum amount of longterm debt the joint agency proposal aims to increase the resolvability and resiliency of large banking organizations by mandating a longterm debt requirement to provide the regulatory agencies additional resources to resolve failed banking organizations foster depositor confidence and decrease costs to the dif in the event of a large banking organization failure under the proposal large bank holding companies and idis would each be required to maintain a minimum amount of eligible longterm debt equal to the greater of percent of rwa percent of average total consolidated assets and percent of total leverage exposure for those banks subject to the supplementary leverage ratio the proposal also prohibits large banking organizations from engaging in certain activities that could complicate their resolution and discourages them from holding longterm debt issued by other banks to reduce interconnectedness the proposal provides for a threeyear transition period with percent of the longterm debt requirement to be met one year after the rule is finalized percent after two years and percent after three years if the rule is adopted as proposed the company estimates as of september that approximately billion of incremental eligible longterm debt will need to be issued to meet the minimum requirement comments on the proposal are due by november we continue to evaluate the full impact of the proposal proposed resolution plan requirements on august the fdic issued a proposal that would require idis with total assets of billion or more including cbna to submit more robust resolution plans biennially that include a comprehensive strategy from the point of failure to liquidation or return of the institution to the private sector the identified strategy must ensure timely access to insured deposits maximize value from the sale or disposition of assets minimize losses realized by creditors and address potential risks of adverse effects on us economic conditions or financial stability in addition the strategy would generally expect but not require a default scenario whereby the fdic as receiver of the failed institution operates the institution under a bridge bank the proposal also enhances how the credibility of resolution plans will be assessed expands expectations regarding engagement and capabilities testing and requires idis to demonstrate the capability to promptly establish a virtual data room in the runup to or upon failure the proposal provides that idis submit their initial resolution plan no earlier than days from the effective date of the amended rule comments on the proposal are due by november we are in the process of evaluating the impact of the proposal on our business citizens financial group inc liquidity we define liquidity as our ability to meet our cashflow and collateral obligations in a timely manner at a reasonable cost as a financial institution we must maintain operating liquidity to meet expected daily and forecasted cashflow requirements as well as contingent liquidity to meet unexpected stress scenario funding requirements reflecting the importance of meeting all unexpected and stressscenario funding requirements we identify and manage contingent liquidity consisting of cash balances at the frb unencumbered highquality liquid securities and unused fhlb borrowing capacity separately we also identify and manage asset liquidity as a subset of contingent liquidity consisting of cash balances at the frb and unencumbered highquality liquid securities we maintain additional secured borrowing capacity at the frb discount window but do not view this as a primary means of funding but rather a potential source of liquidity in a stressed environment or during a market disruption we consider the effective and prudent management of liquidity fundamental to our health and strength we manage liquidity at the consolidated enterprise level and at each material legal entity parent company liquidity our parent companys primary sources of cash are dividends and interest received from cbna resulting from investing in bank equity and subordinated debt as well as externally issued preferred stock senior debt and subordinated debt uses of cash include the routine cash flow requirements as a bank holding company including periodic share repurchases and payments of dividends interest and expenses the needs of subsidiaries including cbna for additional equity and as required its need for debt financing and the support for extraordinary funding requirements when necessary to the extent the parent company has relied on wholesale borrowings uses also include payments of related principal and interest during the three months ended september and the parent company declared dividends on common stock of million and million respectively and declared dividends on preferred stock of million and million respectively during the nine months ended september and the parent company declared dividends on common stock of million and million respectively and declared dividends on preferred stock of million and million respectively during the nine months ended september the parent company repurchased million of its outstanding common stock our parent companys cash and cash equivalents represent a source of liquidity that can be used to meet various needs and totaled billion and billion as of september and december respectively the parent companys doubleleverage ratio the combined equity investment in parent company subsidiaries divided by parent company equity is a measure of reliance on equity cash flows from subsidiaries to fund parent company obligations the parent companys doubleleverage ratio was and as of september and december respectively cbna liquidity as cbnas primary business involves taking deposits and making loans a key role of liquidity management is to ensure that customers have timely access to funds from deposits and for loans liquidity management also involves maintaining sufficient liquidity to repay wholesale borrowings pay operating expenses and support extraordinary funding requirements when necessary in the ordinary course of business the liquidity of cbna is managed by matching sources and uses of cash the primary sources of bank liquidity include deposits from our consumer and commercial customers payments of principal and interest on loans and debt securities and wholesale borrowings as needed and as described under liquidity risk management and governance the primary uses of bank liquidity include withdrawals and maturities of deposits payment of interest on deposits funding of loans and related commitments and funding of securities purchases to the extent that cbna has relied on wholesale borrowings uses also include payments of related principal and interest for further information on cbnas outstanding debt see note during the nine months ended september cbna completed the following transactions issued million of fixedtofloating rate senior notes redeemed million of senior notes due march and issued billion of secured borrowings collateralized by auto loans citizens financial group inc liquidity risk we define liquidity risk as the risk that an entity will be unable to meet its payment obligations in a timely manner at a reasonable cost liquidity risk can arise due to contingent liquidity risk andor funding liquidity risk contingent liquidity risk is the risk that market conditions may reduce an entitys ability to liquidate pledge andor finance certain assets and thereby substantially reduce the liquidity value of such assets drivers of contingent liquidity risk include general market disruptions as well as specific issues regarding the credit quality andor valuation of a security or loan issuer or borrower andor asset class funding liquidity risk is the risk that market conditions andor entityspecific events may reduce an entitys ability to raise funds from depositors andor wholesale market counterparties drivers of funding liquidity risk may be idiosyncratic or systemic reflecting impediments to operations andor damaged market confidence factors affecting liquidity given the composition of assets and borrowing sources contingent liquidity risk at cbna would be materially affected by events such as deterioration of financing markets for highquality securities eg mortgagebacked securities and other instruments issued by gnma fnma and fhlmc by any inability of the fhlbs to provide collateralized advances andor by a refusal of the frb to act as a lender of last resort in systemic stress similarly the funding liquidity risk of cbna could be materially affected by an adverse idiosyncratic event eg a major loss causing a perceived or actual deterioration in its financial condition an adverse systemic event eg default or bankruptcy of a significant capital markets participant or a combination of both consequently and despite ongoing exposure to a variety of idiosyncratic and systemic events we view our contingent liquidity risk and our funding liquidity risk to be relatively low an additional variable affecting our access to unsecured wholesale market funds and to large denomination ie uninsured customer deposits is the credit ratings assigned by such agencies as moodys standard poors and fitch table credit ratings september moodys standard poors fitch citizens financial group inc longterm

ratings could affect both the cost and availability of our wholesale funding existing and evolving regulatory liquidity requirements represent another key driver of systemic liquidity conditions and liquidity management practices the frb occ and fdic regularly evaluate our liquidity as part of the overall supervisory process in addition we are subject to existing and evolving regulatory liquidity requirements some of which are subject to further rulemaking guidance and interpretation by the applicable federal regulators for further discussion see regulation and supervision tailoring of prudential requirements and liquidity requirements in our form 10k citizens financial group inc liquidity risk management and governance liquidity risk is measured and managed by the funding and liquidity unit within our treasury group in accordance with policy guidelines promulgated by our board and the asset liability committee the funding and liquidity unit is responsible for maintaining a liquidity management framework that effectively manages liquidity risk processes within this framework include but are not limited to regular and comprehensive reporting including current levels versus threshold limits for a broad set of liquidity metrics and early warning indicators explanatory commentary relating to emerging risk trends and as appropriate recommended remedial strategies liquidity stress testing contingency funding plans and collateral management our funding and liquidity units primary goals are to deliver and maintain prudent levels of operating liquidity to support expected and projected funding requirements contingent liquidity to support unexpected funding requirements resulting from idiosyncratic systemic and combination stress events and regulatory liquidity requirements in a timely manner from stable and costefficient funding sources we seek to accomplish these goals by funding loans with stable deposits by prudently controlling dependence on wholesale funding particularly shortterm unsecured funding and by maintaining ample available liquidity including a contingent liquidity buffer of unencumbered highquality loans and securities we maintain a contingency funding plan designed to ensure that liquidity sources are sufficient to meet ongoing obligations and commitments particularly in a stressed environment or during a market disruption the plan identifies members of the liquidity contingency team and provides a framework for management to follow including notification and escalation of potential liquidity stress events in response to the recent us bank failures the frb established the bank term funding program to make additional funding available to eligible depository institutions to ensure the ability to meet the needs of all depositors this program was designed to provide another source of liquidity against the par value of highquality securities eliminating the need to sell these securities during times of stress the company is eligible to borrow under this program based on its existing eligibility for primary credit under the frb discount window the company has taken steps to support readiness but has not participated in the program through september as of september organically generated deposits continue to be our primary source of funding resulting in a consolidated periodend loanstodeposits ratio excluding lhfs of estimated insuredsecured deposits comprise of our consolidated deposit base of billion our total available liquidity comprised of contingent liquidity and available discount window

of billion and available discount window capacity was billion defined as available total borrowing capacity from the frb based on identified collateral which is primarily secured by nonmortgage commercial and retail loans for a summary of our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for the nine months ended september and see the consolidated statements of cash flows in item the funding and liquidity unit monitors a variety of liquidity and funding metrics and early warning indicators and metrics including specific risk thresholds limits these monitoring tools are broadly classified as follows current liquidity sources and capacities including cash balances at the frb free and liquid securities and secured borrowing capacity at the fhlb and frb discount window liquidity stress sources including idiosyncratic systemic and combined stresses in addition to evolving regulatory requirements and current and prospective exposures including secured and unsecured wholesale funding and spot and cumulative cashflow gaps across a variety of horizons citizens financial group inc further certain of these metrics are monitored individually for cbna and for our consolidated enterprise on a daily basis including cash position unencumbered securities asset liquidity and available fhlb borrowing capacity in order to identify emerging trends and risks and inform funding decisions specific metrics are also forecasted over a oneyear horizon offbalance sheet arrangements we engage in a variety of activities that are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets that are generally referred to as offbalance sheet arrangements for more information on these types of activities see note critical accounting estimates our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements included in this report are prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our audited consolidated financial statements an accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements estimates are made using facts and circumstances known at a point in time changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates our most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed below for additional information regarding fair value measurements see critical accounting estimates in our form 10k allowance for credit losses the acl increased from billion at december to billion at september our acl as of september accounts for an economic forecast over our twoyear reasonable and supportable period with implied peak unemployment of approximately and peaktotrough gdp decline of approximately this forecast reflects a mild recession over the twoyear reasonable and supportable period this compares to our december forecast which reflected peak unemployment of approximately with a more adverse peaktotrough gdp decline of approximately our determination of the acl is sensitive to changes in forecasted macroeconomic conditions during the reasonable and supportable forecast period to illustrate the sensitivity we applied a more pessimistic scenario than that described above which reflects deeper real gdp contraction across our twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period resulting in a peaktotrough decline in real gdp excluding consideration of qualitative adjustments this scenario would result in a quantitative lifetime loss estimate of approximately our modeled periodend acl or an increase of approximately million this analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimate and not to the overall periodend acl which includes qualitative adjustments because several quantitative and qualitative factors are considered in determining the acl this sensitivity analysis does not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the acl or even what the acl would be under these economic circumstances the sensitivity is intended to provide insights into the impact of adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment and the corresponding impact to modeled loss estimates the hypothetical determination does not incorporate the impact of management judgment or other qualitative factors that could be applied in the actual estimation of the acl and does not imply any expectation of future deterioration in our loss rates it remains difficult to estimate how changes in economic forecasts might affect our acl because such forecasts consider a wide variety of variables and inputs and changes in the variables and inputs may not occur at the same time or in the same direction and such changes may have differing impacts by product type the variables and inputs may be idiosyncratically affected by risks to the economy including changing monetary and fiscal policies impacts from the recent stress on the banking industry and their impact on inflationary trends changes in one or multiple of the key macroeconomic variables may have a material impact to our estimation of expected credit losses for additional information regarding the acl see note of this report and critical accounting estimates allowance for credit losses and note in our form 10k citizens financial group inc goodwill the acquisition method of accounting requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations are recorded at their fair values business combinations typically result in goodwill which is subject to ongoing periodic impairment tests based on the fair values of the reporting units to which the goodwill has been attributed we review the goodwill of each reporting unit for impairment on an annual basis as of october st or more frequently if events or circumstances change that indicate an impairment may exist when assessing goodwill for impairment a qualitative assessment may be made to determine whether it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value alternatively a quantitative assessment may be performed without performing a qualitative assessment the process of evaluating the fair value of a reporting unit is subjective involving management assumptions and estimates and the use of external or internal valuations valuation techniques include discounted cash flow and market approach analysis cash flow projections are based on multiyear financial forecasts developed for each reporting unit that consider key business drivers such as new business initiatives customer retention standards market share changes anticipated loan and deposit growth fees and expenses forward interest rates historical performance credit performance and industry and economic trends among other considerations under the market approach valuation of our reporting units considers a combination of earnings and equity multiples from companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit since the fair values determined under the market approach are representative of noncontrolling interests the valuations incorporate a control premium at september goodwill totaled billion assigned to our reporting units as follows billion to commercial banking and billion to consumer banking we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment in the third quarter of in response to stress in the banking sector and associated market conditions based on this quantitative assessment we concluded that the estimated fair value of the consumer banking and commercial banking reporting units exceeded their carrying value the estimated fair value of our commercial banking reporting unit was not substantially in excess of its carrying value in the quantitative assessment due to impacts from the broader banking environment and the relative amount of preipo goodwill attributed to the unit we also performed a sensitivity analysis around the assumptions used and the resulting estimated fair values in the quantitative assessment while the sensitivity analysis did not indicate an impairment of a reporting unit in the third quarter of continued stress in the banking sector financial markets or our common stock price among other factors could lead to an impairment of our goodwill for additional information regarding goodwill see

measuring exposures as a percentage change in net interest income over the next year due to either instantaneous or gradual parallel changes in rates relative to the market implied forward yield curve as the following table illustrates our balance sheet is assetsensitive net interest income would benefit from an increase in interest rates while exposure to a decline in interest rates is within limits established and monitored by senior management while an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates is included in this analysis we believe that any actual shift in interest rates would be more gradual and therefore have a more modest impact the table below presents the sensitivity of net interest income to various parallel yield curve shifts from the market implied forward yield curve table sensitivity of net interest income estimated change in net interest income over months basis points september december instantaneous change in interest rates gradual change in interest rates we continue to manage asset sensitivity within the scope of our policy changing market conditions and changes in our balance sheet the companys base case net interest income assumes the forward rate path implied by the yield curve is realized which reflects a fed funds rate of at the end of and at the end of reflecting three basis point reductions beginning mid2024 the rate risk exposure is then measured based on assumed changes from that base case rate path asset sensitivity to a 200basis point gradual increase in rates above the base case forward curve was approximately neutral on september compared with on december this decrease reflects the effects of our ongoing hedge activity combined with changes in our current and projected balance sheet mix due to the higher interest rate environment given the higher rate environment and cumulative effect of the frbs tightening of monetary policy our exposure to rates below the forward curve exhibits a higher degree of sensitivity as deposit betas are expected to have an initial lagged response over the twelvemonth horizon the risk position is managed within our risk limits and longterm view of interest rates through occasional adjustments to securities investments interest rate derivatives and mix of funding citizens financial group inc we use a valuation measure of exposure to structural interest rate risk eve as a supplement to net interest income simulations eve complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure over a longterm horizon eve measures the extent to which the economic value of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates this analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with noncontractual maturities we employ sophisticated models for prepayments and deposit pricing and attrition which provide a granular view of cash flows based on the unique characteristics of the underlying products and customer segments the change in value is expressed as a percentage of regulatory capital we use interest rate contracts as part of our alm strategy to
