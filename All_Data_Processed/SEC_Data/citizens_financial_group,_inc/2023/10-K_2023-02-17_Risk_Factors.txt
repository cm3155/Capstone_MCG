item risk factors we are subject to a number of risks potentially impacting our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows as we are a financial services organization certain elements of risk are inherent in our transactions and operations and are present in the business decisions we make we therefore encounter risk as part of the normal course of our business and we design risk management processes to help manage these risks our success is dependent on our ability to identify understand and manage the risks presented by our business activities so that we can appropriately balance revenue generation and profitability these risks include but are not limited to credit risk market risk liquidity risk operational risk model risk technology regulatory and legal risk and strategic and reputational risk we discuss our principal risk management processes and in appropriate places related historical performance in the risk governance section in item you should carefully consider the following risk factors that may affect our business financial condition and results of operations other factors that could affect our business financial condition and results of operation are discussed in the forwardlooking statements section above however there may be additional risks that are not presently material or known and factors besides those discussed below or in this or other reports that we file or furnish with the sec that could also adversely affect us table start citizens financial group inc table end risks related to our business we may not be able to successfully execute our business strategy our business strategy is designed to maximize the full potential of our business and drive sustainable growth and enhanced profitability and our success rests on our ability to maintain a highperforming customercentric organization develop differentiated value propositions to acquire deepen and retain core customer segments build excellent capabilities designed to help us stand out from our competitors operate with financial discipline and a mindset of continuous improvement to selffund investments prudently grow and optimize our balance sheet modernize our technology and operational models to improve delivery organizational agility and speed to market and embed risk management within our culture and our operations our future success and the value of our stock will depend in part on our ability to effectively implement our business strategy including the cost savings and efficiency components and achieve our financial performance goals including through the integration of investors and the hsbc branches there are risks and uncertainties many of which are not within our control associated with each element of our strategy if we are not able to successfully execute our business strategy we may never achieve our financial performance goals and any shortfall may be material see the business strategy section in item for further information supervisory requirements and expectations on us as a financial holding company and a bank holding company and any regulatorimposed limits on our activities could adversely affect our ability to implement our strategic plan expand our business continue to improve our financial performance and make capital distributions to our stockholders our operations are subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination by the federal banking agencies the frb the occ and the fdic as well as the cfpb as part of the supervisory and examination process if we are unsuccessful in meeting the supervisory requirements and expectations that apply to us regulatory agencies may from time to time take supervisory actions against us that may not be publicly disclosed such actions may include restrictions on our activities or the activities of our subsidiaries informal nonpublic or formal public supervisory actions or public enforcement actions including the payment of civil money penalties which could increase our costs and limit our ability to implement our strategic plans and expand our business and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see the regulation and supervision section in item for further information difficult economic conditions including inflationary pressures or volatility in the financial markets would likely have an adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations robust demand labor shortages and supply chain constraints have led to persistent inflationary pressures throughout the economy in response to these inflationary pressures the frb has raised benchmark interest rates in recent months and may continue to raise interest rates in response to economic conditions particularly a continued high rate of inflation amidst these uncertainties including potential recessionary economic conditions financial markets have continued to experience volatility changes in interest rates can affect numerous aspects of our business and may impact our future performance see risk factor headed changes in interest rates may have an adverse effect on our profitability below for more information on the risks associated with changes in interest rates prolonged periods of inflation may impact our profitability by negatively impacting our costs and expenses including increasing funding costs and expense related to talent acquisition and retention and negatively impacting consumer demand and client purchasing power for our products and services if significant inflation continues our business could be negatively affected by among other things increased default rates leading to credit losses which could adversely impact our earnings and capital any of the effects of these adverse economic conditions would likely have an adverse impact on our earnings with the significance of the impact generally depending on the nature and severity of the adverse economic conditions table start citizens financial group inc table end changes in interest rates may have an adverse effect on our profitability net interest income historically has been and we anticipate that it will remain a significant component of our total revenue this is due to the fact that a high percentage of our assets and liabilities have been and will likely continue to be in the form of interestbearing or interestrelated instruments changes in interest rates can have a material effect on many areas of our business including net interest income deposit costs loan volume and delinquency and the value of our mortgage servicing rights interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and in particular the federal open market committee changes in monetary policy including changes in interest rates could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings but such changes could also affect our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits and the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities if the interest rates on our interestbearing liabilities increase at a faster pace than the interest rates on our interest earning assets our net interest income may decline and with it a decline in our earnings may occur our net interest income and our earnings would be similarly affected if the interest rates on our interest earning assets declined at a faster pace than the interest rates on our interestbearing liabilities we cannot control or predict with certainty changes in interest rates global national regional and local economic conditions competitive pressures and the policies of regulatory authorities including monetary policies of the frb affect interest income and interest expense although we have policies and procedures designed to manage the risks associated with changes in market interest rates as further discussed under the risk governance section in item changes in interest rates still may have an adverse effect on our profitability if our ongoing assumptions regarding borrower or depositor behavior or overall economic conditions are significantly different than we anticipate then our risk mitigation may be insufficient to protect against interest rate risk and our net income would be adversely affected changes in the method pursuant to which the libor and other benchmark rates are calculated and their planned discontinuance could adversely impact our business operations and financial results many of our lending products securities derivatives and other financial transactions utilize a benchmark rate such as libor to determine the applicable interest rate or payment amount the uk financial conduct authority and the ice benchmark administration have announced that the publication of the most commonly used us dollar libor tenors will cease to be provided or cease to be representative after june the publication of all other libor settings ceased to be provided or ceased to be representative as of december the adjustable interest rate libor act libor act enacted in march provides a statutory framework to replace u s dollar libor with a benchmark rate based on the secured overnight financing rate sofr for contracts governed by us law that have no fallbacks or fallbacks that would require the use of a poll or liborbased rate and in december the frb adopted rules which identify different sofrbased replacement rates for derivative contracts for cash instruments such as floatingrate notes and preferred stock for consumer loans for certain governmentsponsored enterprise contracts and for certain assetbacked securities we continue to monitor market developments and regulatory updates related to the cessation of libor as well as collaborate with regulators and industry groups on the transition as the transition from libor is ongoing there continues to be uncertainty as to the ultimate effect of the transition on the financial markets for liborlinked financial instruments the discontinuation of a benchmark rate changes in a benchmark rate or changes in market perceptions of the acceptability of a benchmark rate including libor could among other things adversely affect the value of and return on certain of our financial instruments or products result in changes to our risk exposures or require renegotiation of previous transactions in addition any such discontinuation or changes whether actual or anticipated could result in market volatility increased compliance legal and operational costs and risks associated with customer disclosures and contract negotiations although the libor act includes safe harbors if the frbidentified sofrbased replacement rate is selected these safe harbors are untested as a result and despite the enactment of the libor act for the most commonly used us dollar libor settings the use or selection of a successor rate could also expose us to risks associated with disputes with customers and other market participants in connection with implementing libor fallback provisions for more information on our libor transition see the market risk section in item table start citizens financial group inc table end we could fail to attract retain or motivate highly skilled and qualified personnel including our senior management other key employees or members of our board which could impair our ability to successfully execute our strategic plan and otherwise adversely affect our business a cornerstone of our strategic plan involves the hiring of highly skilled and qualified personnel accordingly our ability to implement our strategic plan and our future success depends on our ability to attract retain and motivate highly skilled and qualified personnel including our senior management and other key employees and directors the marketplace for skilled personnel is becoming more competitive which means the cost of hiring incentivizing and retaining skilled personnel may continue to increase for example the increase in remote and hybrid work arrangements has also increased competition for skilled personnel and our current or future approach to inoffice and remotework arrangements may not meet the needs or expectations of current or prospective employees or may not be perceived as favorable as compared to the arrangements offered by other companies which could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain skilled and qualified personnel the failure to attract or retain including as a result of an untimely death or illness of key personnel or replace a sufficient number of appropriately skilled and key personnel could place us at a significant competitive disadvantage and prevent us from successfully implementing our strategy which could impair our ability to implement our strategic plan successfully achieve our performance targets and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations limitations on the manner in which regulated financial institutions such as us can compensate their officers and employees including those contained in pending rule proposals implementing requirements of section of the doddfrank act may make it more difficult for such institutions to compete for talent with financial institutions and other companies not subject to these or similar limitations if we are unable to compete effectively our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected perhaps materially our ability to meet our obligations and the cost of funds to do so depend on our ability to access identified sources of liquidity at a reasonable cost liquidity risk is the risk that we will not be able to meet our obligations including funding commitments as they come due this risk is inherent in our operations and can be heightened by a number of factors including an overreliance on a particular source of funding including for example secured fhlb advances changes in credit ratings or marketwide phenomena such as market dislocation and major disasters like many banking groups our reliance on customer deposits to meet a considerable portion of our funding has grown over recent years and we continue to seek to increase the proportion of our funding represented by customer deposits however these deposits are subject to fluctuation due to certain factors outside our control such as increasing competitive pressures for retail or corporate customer deposits changes in interest rates and returns on other investment classes or a loss of confidence by customers in us or in the banking sector generally which could result in a significant outflow of deposits within a short period of time to the extent there is heightened competition among us banks for retail customer deposits this competition may increase the cost of procuring new deposits andor retaining existing deposits and otherwise negatively affect our ability to grow our deposit base an inability to grow or any material decrease in our deposits could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our liquidity needs maintaining a diverse and appropriate funding strategy for our assets consistent with our wider strategic risk appetite and plan remains challenging and any tightening of credit markets could have a material adverse impact on us in particular there is a risk that corporate and financial institution counterparties may seek to reduce their credit exposures to banks and other financial institutions for example reductions in unsecured deposits supplied by these counterparties which may cause funding from these sources to no longer be available under these circumstances we may need to seek funds from alternative sources potentially at higher costs than has previously been the case or may be required to consider disposals of other assets not previously identified for disposal in order to reduce our funding commitments table start citizens financial group inc table end a reduction in our credit ratings which are based on a number of factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations credit ratings affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding rating agencies regularly evaluate us and their ratings are based on a number of factors including our financial strength other factors considered by rating agencies include conditions affecting the financial services industry generally any downgrade in our ratings would likely increase our borrowing costs could limit our access to capital markets and otherwise adversely affect our business for example a ratings downgrade could adversely affect our ability to sell or market certain of our securities including longterm debt engage in certain longerterm derivatives transactions and retain our customers particularly corporate customers who may require a minimum rating threshold in order to place funds with us in addition under the terms of certain of our derivatives contracts we may be required to maintain a minimum credit rating or have to post additional collateral or terminate such contracts any of these results of a rating downgrade could increase our cost of funding reduce our liquidity and have adverse effects on our business financial condition and results of operations our financial performance may be adversely affected by deterioration in borrower credit quality particularly in the new england midatlantic and midwest regions where our operations are predominately concentrated we have exposure to many different industries and risks arising from actual or perceived changes in credit quality and uncertainty over the recoverability of amounts due from borrowers is inherent in our businesses our exposure may be exacerbated by the geographic concentration of our operations which are predominately located in the new england midatlantic and midwest regions the credit quality of our borrowers may deteriorate for a number of reasons that are outside our control including as a result of prevailing economic and market conditions and asset valuation the trends and risks affecting borrower credit quality particularly in the new england midatlantic and midwest regions have caused and in the future may cause us to experience impairment charges increased repurchase demands higher costs additional writedowns and losses and an inability to engage in routine funding transactions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss our risk management framework is made up of various processes and strategies to manage our risk exposure the framework to manage risk including the frameworks underlying assumptions may not be effective under all conditions and circumstances if the risk management framework proves ineffective we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected one of the main types of risks inherent in our business is credit risk an important feature of our credit risk management system is to employ an internal credit risk control system through which we identify measure monitor and mitigate existing and emerging credit risk of our customers as this process involves detailed analyses of the customer or credit risk taking into account both quantitative and qualitative factors it is subject to human error in exercising their judgment our employees may not always be able to assign an accurate credit rating to a customer or credit risk which may result in our exposure to higher credit risks than indicated by our risk rating system in addition we have undertaken certain actions to enhance our credit policies and guidelines to address potential risks associated with particular industries or types of customers as discussed in more detail under the risk governance and market risk sections in item however we may not be able to effectively implement these initiatives or consistently follow and refine our credit risk management system if any of the foregoing were to occur it may result in an increase in the level of nonaccrual loans and a higher risk exposure for us which could have a material adverse effect on us table start citizens financial group inc table end changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition from time to time the fasb and sec change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the accounting for our financial results and the preparation of our financial statements these changes can be operationally complex to implement and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations for example in june the fasb issued accounting standards update measurement of credit losses on financial instruments cecl that substantially changed the accounting for credit losses on loans and other financial assets held by banks financial institutions and other organizations upon adoption of cecl on january we recognize credit losses on these assets equal to managements estimate of credit losses over the full remaining expected life we consider all relevant information when estimating expected credit losses including details about past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts as evidenced in the first half of due to the impact of covid19 the standard introduces heightened volatility in provision for credit losses given uncertainty in the accuracy of macroeconomic forecasts over longer time horizons variances in the rate and composition of loan growth and changes in overall loan portfolio size and mix as a result it is possible that our ongoing reported earnings and lending activity could be negatively impacted for more information regarding cecl see note in item our financial and accounting estimates and risk management framework rely on analytical forecasting and models the processes we use to estimate our inherent loan losses and to measure the fair value of financial instruments as well as the processes used to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations depends upon the use of analytical and forecasting models some of our tools and metrics for managing risk are based upon our use of observed historical market behavior we rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values models may be used in such processes as determining the pricing of various products grading loans and extending credit measuring interest rate and other market risks predicting losses assessing capital adequacy and calculating regulatory capital levels as well as estimating the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items poorly designed or implemented models present the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporating such models will be adversely affected due to the inadequacy of that information moreover our models may fail to predict future risk exposures if the information used in the model is incorrect obsolete or not sufficiently comparable to actual events as they occur we seek to incorporate appropriate historical data in our models but the range of market values and behaviors reflected in any period of historical data is not at all times predictive of future developments in any particular period and the period of data we incorporate into our models may turn out to be inappropriate for the future period being modeled in such case our ability to manage risk would be limited and our risk exposure and losses could be significantly greater than our models indicated in addition if existing or potential customers believe our risk management is inadequate they could take their business elsewhere this could harm our reputation as well as our revenues and profits finally information we provide to our regulators based on poorly designed or implemented models could also be inaccurate or insufficient some of the decisions that our regulators make including those related to capital distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected due to their perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient the preparation of our financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results particularly various factors may cause our allowance for credit losses to increase the preparation of audited consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements our most critical accounting estimate is the acl the acl is a reserve established through a provision for credit losses charged to expense and represents our estimate of expected credit losses within the existing loan and lease portfolio and unfunded lending commitments the level of the acl is based on periodic evaluation of the loan and lease portfolios and unfunded lending commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable considering a number of relevant underlying factors including key assumptions and evaluation of quantitative and qualitative information table start citizens financial group inc table end the determination of the appropriate level of the acl inherently involves a degree of subjectivity and requires that we make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends all of which may undergo material changes changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers the stagnation of certain economic indicators that we are more susceptible to such as unemployment and real estate values new information regarding existing loans identification of additional problem loans and other factors both within and outside our control may require an increase in the acl in addition bank regulatory agencies periodically review our acl and may require an increase in the acl or the recognition of further loan chargeoffs based on judgments that can differ from those of our own management in addition if chargeoffs in future periods exceed the aclthat is if the acl is inadequatewe will need to recognize additional provision for credit losses should such additional provision expense become necessary it would result in a decrease in net income and capital and may have a material adverse effect on us for more information regarding our use of estimates in preparation of financial statements see note in item and the critical accounting estimates section in item operational risks are inherent in our businesses our operations depend on our ability to process a very large number of transactions efficiently and accurately while complying with applicable laws and regulations operational risk and losses can result from internal and external fraud improper conduct or errors by employees or third parties failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper authorization failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements and conduct of business rules equipment failures including those caused by natural disasters or by electrical telecommunications or other essential utility outages business continuity and data security system failures including those caused by computer viruses cyberattacks against us or our vendors or unforeseen problems encountered while implementing major new computer systems or upgrades to existing systems or the inadequacy or failure of systems and controls including those of our suppliers or counterparties although we have implemented risk controls and loss mitigation actions and substantial resources are devoted to developing efficient procedures identifying and rectifying weaknesses in existing procedures and training staff it is not possible to be certain that such actions have been or will be effective in controlling each of the operational risks faced by us any weakness in these systems or controls or any breaches or alleged breaches of such laws or regulations could result in increased regulatory supervision enforcement actions and other disciplinary action and have an adverse impact on our business applicable authorizations and licenses reputation and results of operations the financial services industry including the banking sector is undergoing rapid technological change as a result of changes in customer behavior competition and changes in the legal and regulatory framework and we may not be able to compete effectively as a result of these changes the financial services industry including the banking sector is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technologydriven products and services in addition new unexpected technological changes could have a disruptive effect on the way banks offer products and services we believe our success depends to a great extent on our ability to address customer needs by using technology to offer products and services that provide convenience to customers and to create additional efficiencies in our operations however we may not be able to among other things keep up with the rapid pace of technological changes effectively implement new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers as a result our ability to compete effectively to attract or retain new business may be impaired and our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected in addition changes in the legal and regulatory framework under which we operate require us to update our information systems to ensure compliance our need to review and evaluate the impact of ongoing rule proposals final rules and implementation guidance from regulators further complicates the development and implementation of new information systems for our business also recent regulatory guidance has focused on the need for financial institutions to perform increased due diligence and ongoing monitoring of thirdparty vendor relationships thus increasing the scope of management involvement and decreasing the efficiency otherwise resulting from our relationships with thirdparty technology providers given the significant number of ongoing regulatory reform initiatives it is possible that we incur higher than expected information technology costs in order to comply with current and impending regulations see supervisory requirements and expectations on us as a fhc and a bhc and any regulatorimposed limits on our activities could adversely affect our ability to implement our strategic plan expand our business continue to improve our financial performance and make capital distributions to our stockholders table start citizens financial group inc table end we are subject to a variety of cybersecurity risks that if realized could adversely affect how we conduct our business information security risks for large financial institutions such as us have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies such as the internet and mobile banking to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists nationstates activists and other external parties third parties with whom we or our customers do business also present operational and information security risks to us including security breaches or failures of their own systems risks relating to cyberattacks on our vendors and other third parties including supply chain attacks affecting our software and information technology service providers have been rising as such attacks become increasingly frequent and severe the possibility of employee error failure to follow security procedures or malfeasance also presents these risks particularly given the recent trend towards remote work arrangements our operations rely on the secure processing transmission and storage of confidential information in our computer systems and networks as well as in the thirdparty computer systems and networks used to provide products and services on our behalf in addition to access our products and services our customers may use personal computers smartphones tablets and other mobile devices that are beyond our control environment although we believe that we have appropriate information security procedures and controls based on our adherence to applicable laws and regulations industry standards and best practices our technologies systems networks and our customers devices may be the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse theft sale or loss or destruction of the confidential andor proprietary information of cfg our customers our vendors our counterparties or our employees we are under continuous threat of loss or network degradation due to cyberattacks such as computer viruses malicious or destructive code phishing attacks ransomware and distributed denial of service ddos attacks this is especially true as we continue to expand customer capabilities to utilize the internet and other remote channels to transact business two of the most significant cyberattack risks that we face are efraud and loss of sensitive customer data loss from efraud occurs when cybercriminals extract funds directly from customers or our accounts using fraudulent schemes that may include internetbased funds transfers we have been subject to a number of efraud incidents historically we have also been subject to attempts to steal sensitive customer data such as account numbers and social security numbers through unauthorized access to our computer systems including computer hacking such attacks are less frequent but could present significant reputational legal and regulatory costs to us if successful we have implemented certain technology protections such as customer profiling and setup authentication to be in compliance with the ffiec authentication and access to financial institution services and systems guidelines as cyber threats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our layers of defense or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities system enhancements and updates may also create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones due to the complexity and interconnectedness of information technology systems the process of enhancing our layers of defense can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues in addition addressing certain information security vulnerabilities such as hardwarebased vulnerabilities may affect the performance of our information technology systems the ability of our hardware and software providers to deliver patches and updates to mitigate vulnerabilities in a timely manner can introduce additional risks particularly when a vulnerability is being actively exploited by threat actors cyberattacks against the patches themselves have also proven to be a significant risk that companies will have to address going forward despite our efforts to prevent a cyberattack a successful cyberattack could persist for an extended period of time before being detected and following detection it could take considerable time for us to obtain full and reliable information about the cybersecurity incident and the extent amount and type of information compromised during the course of an investigation we may not necessarily know the full effects of the incident or how to remediate it and actions and decisions that are taken or made in an effort to mitigate risk may further increase the costs and other negative consequences of the incident moreover potential new regulations may require us to disclose information about a cybersecurity event before it has been resolved or fully investigated table start citizens financial group inc table end the techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently may not be recognized until launched and can be initiated from a variety of sources including terrorist organizations and hostile foreign governments these actors may attempt to fraudulently induce employees customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to data or our systems in the event that a cyberattack is successful our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected for a discussion of the guidance that federal banking regulators have released regarding cybersecurity and cyber risk management standards see the regulation and supervision section of item we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business any failure interruption or breach in security of these systems including due to hacking or other similar attempts to breach information technology security protocols could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management general ledger deposit loan and other systems although we have established policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible failure interruption or security breach of our information systems there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will be successful and that any such failure interruption or security breach will not occur or if they do occur that they will be adequately addressed the occurrence of any failure interruption or security breach of our information systems could require us to devote substantial resources including management time and attention to recovery and response efforts damage our reputation result in a loss of customer business subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability although we maintain insurance coverage for information security events we may incur losses as a result of such events that are not insured against or not fully covered by our insurance we rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology we rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology functions and the provision of information technology and business process services for example i unaffiliated third parties operate data communications networks on which certain components and services relating to our online banking system rely ii third parties host or maintain many of our applications including a commercial loan system which is hosted and maintained by automated financial systems inc and our mobile digital banking application which is hosted and maintained by amazon web services inc iii fidelity information services llc maintains our core deposits system iv infosys limited provides us with a wide range of information technology support services including service desk end user support production application support and private cloud support and v kyndryl inc provides us with mainframe support services the success of our business depends in part on the continuing ability of these and other third parties to perform these functions and services in a timely and satisfactory manner which performance could be disrupted or otherwise adversely affected due to failures or other information security events originating at the third parties or at the third parties suppliers or vendors socalled fourth party risk for example during there were a number of widely publicized cases of outages in connection with access to cloud service providers we may not be able to effectively monitor or mitigate fourthparty risk in particular as it relates to the use of common suppliers or vendors by the third parties that perform functions and services for us if we experience a disruption in the provision of any functions or services performed by third parties we may have difficulty in finding alternate providers on terms favorable to us and in reasonable time frames if these services are not performed in a satisfactory manner we would not be able to serve our customers well in either situation our business could incur significant costs and be adversely affected we are exposed to reputational risk and the risk of damage to our brands and the brands of our affiliates our success and results depend in part on our reputation and the strength of our brands we are vulnerable to adverse market perception as we operate in an industry where integrity customer trust and confidence are paramount we are exposed to the risk that litigation employee misconduct operational failures the outcome of regulatory or other investigations or actions press speculation and negative publicity perception of our environmental social and governance practices and disclosures among other factors could damage our brands or reputation our brands and reputation could also be harmed if we sell products or services that do not perform as expected or customers expectations for the product are not satisfied table start citizens financial group inc table end unpredictable catastrophic events including pandemics terrorist attacks extreme weather events and other largescale catastrophes could have an adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations the occurrence of catastrophic events including pandemics such as covid19 terrorists attacks extreme weather events such as hurricanes tropical storms or tornadoes and other largescale catastrophes could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations including by affecting the stability of our deposit base impairing the ability of our borrowers to repay outstanding loans impairing the value of collateral securing loans causing significant property damage or operational disruptions resulting in loss of revenue or causing us to incur additional expenses for example the covid19 pandemic has in the past negatively affected and could in the future negatively affect the global and us economies including by increasing unemployment levels disrupting supply chains and businesses in many industries lowering equity market valuations decreasing liquidity in fixed income markets and creating significant volatility and disruption in financial markets this has in the past resulted in and could in the future result in higher and more volatile provisions for credit losses and has in the past adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect our noninterest income the extent to which the covid19 pandemic could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations as well as our liquidity and capital profile will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including the scope and duration of the pandemic any resurgence of covid19 cases and the emergence of new variants the widespread availability use and effectiveness of vaccines actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic and the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on us our clients and customers our service providers and other market participants as the covid19 pandemic adversely affects us it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein furthermore although we maintain both business continuity and disaster recovery plans if a terrorist attack extreme weather event or other catastrophe rendered both our production data center in rhode island and our recovery data center in north carolina unusable there can be no assurance that these plans and related capabilities will adequately protect us from such events and our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected the effects of geopolitical instability such as russias invasion of ukraine may adversely affect us and create significant risks and uncertainties for our business with the ultimate impact dependent on future developments which are highly uncertain and unpredictable ongoing geopolitical instability such as russias invasion of ukraine has negatively impacted and could in the future negatively impact the global and us economies including by causing supply chain disruptions rising prices for oil and other commodities volatility in capital markets and foreign currency exchange rates rising interest rates and heightened cybersecurity risks the extent to which such geopolitical instability such as russias invasion of ukraine adversely affects our business financial condition and results of operations as well as our liquidity and capital profile will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and unpredictable including with respect to russias invasion the extent and duration of the invasion and economic sanctions imposed on russia and the immeasurable humanitarian toll inflicted on ukraine if geopolitical instability adversely affects us it may also have the effect of heightening other risks related to our business risks related to our industry any deterioration in national economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our business is affected by national economic conditions as well as perceptions of those conditions and future economic prospects changes in such economic conditions are not predictable and cannot be controlled adverse economic conditions such as challenges in the global supply chain and recent inflationary trends could require us to charge off a higher percentage of loans and increase the provision for credit losses which would reduce our net income and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations table start citizens financial group inc table end we operate in an industry that is highly competitive which could result in losing business or margin declines and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we operate in a highly competitive industry the industry could become even more competitive as a result of reform of the financial services industry resulting from the doddfrank act and other legislative regulatory and technological changes as well as continued consolidation we face aggressive competition from other domestic and foreign lending institutions and from numerous other providers of financial services including nonbanking financial institutions that are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as banks and bhcs securities firms and insurance companies and competitors that may have greater financial resources with respect to nonbanking financial institutions technology and other changes have lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks for example consumers can maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts or mutual funds consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills andor transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks in addition the emergence adoption and evolution of new technologies that do not require intermediation including distributed ledgers such as digital assets and blockchain as well as advances in robotic process automation could significantly affect the competition for financial services the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries known as disintermediation could result in the loss of fee income as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits some of our nonbank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations we are and therefore may have greater flexibility in competing for business as a result of these and other sources of competition we could lose business to competitors or be forced to price products and services on less advantageous terms to retain or attract clients either of which would adversely affect our profitability climate change manifesting as physical or transition risks could adversely affect our operations businesses and customers there is increasing global concern over the risks of climate change and related environmental sustainability matters the physical risks of climate change include discrete events such as flooding and wildfires and longerterm shifts in climate patterns such as extreme heat sea level rise and more frequent and prolonged drought such events could disrupt our operations or those of our clients customers or service

improvements in various areas if we are unable to implement and maintain any required actions in a timely and effective manner we could become subject to informal nonpublic or formal public supervisory actions and public enforcement orders that could lead to significant restrictions on our existing business or on our ability to engage in any new business such forms of supervisory action could include without limitation written agreements cease and desist orders and consent orders and may among other things result in restrictions on our ability to pay dividends requirements to increase capital restrictions on our activities the imposition of civil monetary penalties and enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders we could also be required to

advise us to operate under various restrictions as a prudential matter any such actions or restrictions if and in whatever manner imposed could adversely affect our costs and revenues moreover efforts to comply with any such nonpublic supervisory actions or restrictions may require material investments in additional resources and systems as well as a significant commitment of managerial time and

evolving regulatory requirements that could have a material adverse effect on our business and earnings we are heavily regulated by multiple banking consumer protection securities and other regulatory authorities at the federal and state levels this regulatory oversight is primarily established to protect depositors the dif consumers of financial products and the financial system as a whole not our security holders changes to statutes regulations rules or policies including the interpretation implementation or enforcement of statutes regulations rules or policies could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways including by for example subjecting us to additional costs limiting the types of financial services and other products we may offer limiting our ability to pursue acquisitions and increasing the ability of third parties including nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products in recent years we together with the rest of the financial services industry have faced particularly intense scrutiny with many new regulatory initiatives and vigorous oversight and enforcement on the part of numerous regulatory and governmental authorities legislatures and regulators have pursued a broad array of initiatives intended to promote the safety and soundness of financial institutions financial market stability the transparency and liquidity of financial markets and consumer and investor protection certain regulators and law enforcement authorities have also recently required admissions of wrongdoing and in some cases criminal pleas as part of the resolutions of matters brought by them against financial institutions any such resolution of a matter involving us could lead to increased exposure to civil litigation could adversely affect our reputation could result in penalties or limitations on our ability to do business or engage in certain activities and could have other negative effects in addition a single event or issue may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings including by multiple federal and state regulators and other governmental authorities we are also subject to laws and regulations relating to the privacy of the information of our customers employees counterparties and others and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to liability andor reputational damage as new privacyrelated laws and regulations are implemented the time and resources needed for us to comply with those laws and regulations as well as our potential liability for noncompliance and our reporting obligations in the case of data breaches may significantly increase while there have been significant revisions to the laws and regulations applicable to us that have been finalized in recent years there are other rules to implement changes that have yet to be proposed or enacted by our regulators the final timing scope and impact of these changes to the regulatory framework applicable to financial institutions remains uncertain for more information on regulations to which we are subject and recent initiatives to reform financial institution regulation see the regulation and supervision section in item we are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity standards and if we fail to meet these standards our financial condition and operations would be adversely affected we are subject to several capital adequacy and liquidity standards to the extent that we are unable to meet these standards our ability to make distributions of capital will be limited and we may be subject to additional supervisory actions and limitations on our activities see regulation and supervision in item and the capital and regulatory requirements and liquidity sections in item for further discussion of the regulations to which we are subject the parent company could be required to act as a source of strength to cbna which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations frb policy historically required bhcs to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks the doddfrank act codified this policy as a statutory requirement this support may be required by the frb at times when we might otherwise determine not to provide it or when doing so is not otherwise in the interests of cfg or our stockholders or creditors and may include one or more of the following the parent company may be compelled to contribute capital to cbna including by engaging in a public offering to raise such capital furthermore any extensions of credit from the parent company to cbna that are included in cbnas capital would be subordinate in right of payment to depositors and certain other indebtedness of cbna in the event of a bhcs bankruptcy any commitment that the bhc had been required to make to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment in the event of impairment of the capital stock of cbna the parent company as cbnas stockholder could be required to pay such deficiency table start citizens financial group inc table end the parent company depends on cbna for substantially all of its revenue and restrictions on dividends and other distributions by cbna could affect its liquidity and ability to fulfill our obligations as a bhc the parent company is a separate and distinct legal entity from cbna our banking subsidiary the parent company typically receives substantially all of our revenue from dividends from cbna these dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on our equity and interest and principal on our debt various federal andor state laws and regulations as well as regulatory expectations limit the amount of dividends that cbna may pay to the parent company also our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiarys liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiarys creditors in the event cbna is unable to pay dividends to the parent company it may not be able to service debt pay obligations or pay dividends on its common stock the inability to receive dividends from cbna could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations see the supervision and regulation section in item and the capital and regulatory matters section in item from timetotime we may become or are subject to regulatory actions that may have a material impact on our business we may become or are involved from time to time in reviews investigations and proceedings both formal and informal by governmental and selfregulatory agencies regarding our business these regulatory actions involve among other matters accounting compliance and operational matters certain of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief that may require changes to our business or otherwise materially impact our business in regulatory actions such as those referred to above it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or whether it is possible to reasonably estimate the amount of any loss we cannot predict with certainty if how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual fine penalty or other relief conditions or restrictions if any may be particularly for actions that are in their early stages of investigation the parent company may be required to make significant restitution payments to cbna customers arising from certain compliance issues and also may be required to pay civil money penalties in connection with certain of these issues this uncertainty makes it difficult to estimate probable losses which in turn can lead to substantial disparities between the reserves we may establish for such proceedings and the eventual settlements fines or penalties adverse regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we are and may be subject to litigation that may have a material impact on our business our operations are diverse and complex and we operate in legal and regulatory environments that expose us to potentially significant litigation risk in the normal course of business we have been named from time to time as a defendant in various legal actions including arbitrations class actions and other litigation arising in connection with our activities as a financial services institution including with respect to alleged unfair or deceptive business practices and misselling of certain products certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory andor punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages in some cases the entities that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or in financial distress moreover a number of recent judicial decisions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lending institutions on the basis of various evolving legal theories collectively termed lender liability generally lender liability is founded on the premise that a lender has either violated a duty whether implied or contractual of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors or stockholders this could increase the amount of private litigation to which we are subject for more information regarding ongoing significant legal proceedings in which we may be involved see note in item table start citizens financial

significant technical challenges although we believe our current policies and procedures are sufficient to comply with applicable rules and regulations we cannot guarantee that our antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing policies and procedures completely prevent situations of money laundering or terrorism financing any such failure events may have severe consequences including sanctions fines and reputational consequences which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations risks related to our common stock our stock price may be volatile and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result you should consider an investment in our common stock to be risky and you should invest in our common stock only if you can withstand a significant loss and wide fluctuation in the market value of your investment the market price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to among other things the factors described in this risk factors section and other factors some of which are beyond our control these factors include quarterly variations in our results of operations or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us changes in expectations as to our future financial performance including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors our announcements or our competitors announcements regarding new products or services enhancements significant contracts acquisitions or strategic investments fluctuations in the market valuations of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us future sales of our common stock additions or departures of members of our senior management or other key personnel changes in industry conditions or perceptions and changes in applicable laws rules or regulations and other dynamics furthermore the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market price of equity securities of many companies these fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies these broad market fluctuations as well as general economic systemic political and market conditions such as recessions loss of investor confidence interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock if any of the foregoing occurs it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to securities class action litigation that even if unsuccessful could be costly to defend and a distraction to management we may not repurchase shares or pay cash dividends on our common stock holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock we are not required to do so and may reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future this could adversely affect the market price of our common stock also as a bhc our ability to repurchase shares and declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain federal regulatory considerations including the rules of the frb regarding capital adequacy and dividends additionally we are also generally required to receive the frbs approval for any dividends share repurchases or redemption of capital securities if we are required to resubmit our capital plan further if we are unable to satisfy the capital requirements applicable to us for any reason we may be limited in our ability to repurchase shares and declare and pay dividends on our capital stock see the regulation and supervision section in item

in delaware law and our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws as well as regulatory approvals that would be required under federal law could make it more difficult for a third party to take control of us and may prevent stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares of our common stock these provisions could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could reduce the amount that stockholders might get if we are sold furthermore banking laws impose notice approval and ongoing regulatory requirements on any stockholder or other party that seeks to acquire direct or indirect control of an fdicinsured depository institution these laws include the bank holding company act and the change in bank control act
