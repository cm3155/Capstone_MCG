in meaningful ways competition the financial services industry is highly competitive our branch footprint is in the new england midatlantic and midwest regions though certain lines of business serve national markets within these markets we face competition from community banks superregional and national financial institutions credit unions savings and loan associations mortgage banking firms consumer finance companies securities brokerage firms insurance companies money market funds hedge funds and private equity firms some of our larger competitors may make available to their customers a broader array of products pricing and structure alternatives while some smaller competitors may have more liberal lending policies and processes competition among providers of financial products and services continues to increase with consumers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives the ability of nonbanking financial institutions including fintech companies to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has also intensified competition in consumer banking the industry has become increasingly dependent on and oriented toward technologydriven delivery systems permitting transactions to be conducted through telephone online and mobile channels in addition technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbank institutions to attract funds and provide lending and other financial products and services the emergence of digitalonly banking models has increased and we expect this trend to continue given their lower cost structure these models are often on average able to offer higher rates on deposit products than retail banking institutions with a traditional branch footprint the primary factors driving competition for loans and deposits are interest rates fees charged tailored value propositions to different customer segments customer service levels convenience including branch locations and hours of operation and the range of products and services offered in commercial banking there is intense competition for quality loan originations from traditional banking institutions particularly large regional banks as well as commercial finance companies leasing companies and other nonbank lenders and institutional investors including collateralized loan obligation managers hedge funds and private equity firms some larger competitors including certain national banks that compete in our market area may offer a broader array of products and due to their asset size

identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired if an agency determines that a bank fails to satisfy any standard it may require the bank to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance consistent with deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans if after being notified to submit a compliance plan an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject under the fdia see federal deposit insurance act below if an institution fails to comply with such an order the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties federal deposit insurance act the fdia requires among other things that the federal banking regulators take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements as described above in capital the fdia sets forth the following five capital categories wellcapitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized a depository institutions capital category depends upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors that are established by regulation the federal banking regulators must take certain mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions that are undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized with the actions becoming more restrictive and punitive the lower the institutions capital category under existing rules an institution that is not an advanced approaches institution is deemed to be well capitalized if it has a cet1 ratio of at least a tier capital ratio of at least a total capital ratio of at least and a tier leverage ratio of at least the fdias prompt corrective action provisions only apply to depository institutions and not to bank holding companies the frbs regulations applicable to bank holding companies separately define well capitalized for bank holding companies to require maintaining a tier capital ratio of at least and a total capital ratio of at least as described above under financial holding company regulation a financial holding company that is not wellcapitalized and wellmanaged or whose bank subsidiaries are not well table start citizens financial group inc table end capitalized and well managed under applicable prompt corrective action standards may be restricted in certain of its activities and ultimately may lose financial holding company status as of december the parent company and cbna were wellcapitalized the fdia prohibits insured banks from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in the banks normal market area or nationally depending upon where the deposits are solicited unless it is wellcapitalized or it is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the fdic a bank that is adequately capitalized and accepts brokered deposits under a waiver from the fdic may not pay an interest rate on any deposit in excess of basis points over certain prevailing market rates the fdia imposes no such restrictions on a bank that is wellcapitalized deposit insurance the fdia requires cbna to pay deposit insurance assessments fdic assessment rates for large institutions are calculated based on one of two scorecards one for most large institutions that have more than billion in assets and another for highly complex institutions that have over billion in assets and are fully owned by a parent with over billion in assets each scorecard has a performance score and a lossseverity score that are combined to produce a total score which is translated into an initial assessment rate in calculating these scores the fdic utilizes the camels ratings and forwardlooking financial measures to assess an institutions ability to withstand assetrelated stress and fundingrelated stress the fdic has the ability to make discretionary adjustments to the total score based upon significant risk factors that are not adequately captured in the scorecard the total score is then translated to an initial base assessment rate on a nonlinear sharplyincreasing scale the deposit insurance assessment is calculated based on average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity of the insured depository institution during the assessment period deposit insurance assessments are also affected by the minimum reserve ratio with respect to the deposit insurance fund dif the fdia established a minimum reserve ratio of the dif of prior to september and thereafter as of september the reserve ratio of the dif was on september the fdics board of directors voted to adopt a restoration plan to restore the dif reserve ratio
