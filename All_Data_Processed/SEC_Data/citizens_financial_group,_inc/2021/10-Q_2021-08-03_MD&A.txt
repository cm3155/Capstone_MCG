loans and related commitments and funding of securities purchases to the extent that cbna has relied on wholesale borrowings uses also include payments of related principal and interest for further information on cbnas outstanding debt see note as cbnas primary business involves taking deposits and making loans a key role of liquidity management is to ensure that customers have timely access to funds from deposits and for loans liquidity management also involves maintaining sufficient liquidity to repay wholesale borrowings pay operating expenses and support extraordinary funding requirements when necessary liquidity risk we define liquidity risk as the risk that an entity will be unable to meet its payment obligations in a timely manner at a reasonable cost liquidity risk can arise due to contingent liquidity risk andor funding liquidity risk contingent liquidity risk is the risk that market conditions may reduce an entitys ability to liquidate pledge andor finance certain assets and thereby substantially reduce the liquidity value of such assets drivers of contingent liquidity risk include general market disruptions as well as specific issues regarding the credit quality andor valuation of a security or loan issuer or borrower andor asset class funding liquidity risk is the risk that market conditions andor entityspecific events may reduce an entitys ability to raise funds from depositors andor wholesale market counterparties drivers of funding liquidity risk may be idiosyncratic or systemic reflecting impediments to operations andor damaged market confidence citizens financial group inc factors affecting liquidity given the composition of assets and borrowing sources contingent liquidity risk at cbna would be materially affected by events such as deterioration of financing markets for highquality securities eg mortgagebacked securities and other instruments issued by the gnma fnma and the fhlmc by any inability of the fhlbs to provide collateralized advances andor by a refusal of the frb to act as a lender of last resort in systemic stress similarly given the structure of its balance sheet the funding liquidity risk of cbna would be materially affected by an adverse idiosyncratic event eg a major loss causing a perceived or actual deterioration in its financial condition an adverse systemic event eg default or bankruptcy of a significant capital markets participant or a combination of both consequently and despite ongoing exposure to a variety of idiosyncratic and systemic events we view our contingent liquidity risk and our funding liquidity risk to be relatively modest an additional variable affecting our access to unsecured wholesale market funds and to large denomination ie uninsured customer deposits is the credit ratings assigned by such agencies as moodys standard and poors and fitch table credit ratings june moodys standard and poors fitch citizens financial group inc longterm issuer nr bbb bbb

funding profile cbna continues to minimize reliance on unsecured wholesale funding at june our wholesale funding consisted primarily of term debt issued by the parent company and cbna existing and evolving regulatory liquidity requirements represent another key driver of systemic liquidity conditions and liquidity management practices the frb the occ and the fdic regularly evaluate our

management and governance liquidity risk is measured and managed by the funding and liquidity unit within our treasury unit in accordance with policy guidelines promulgated by our board and the asset

metrics and early warning indicators explanatory commentary relating to emerging risk trends and as appropriate recommended remedial strategies citizens financial group inc our funding and liquidity units primary goal is to deliver and maintain prudent levels of operating liquidity to support expected and projected funding requirements as well as contingent liquidity to support unexpected funding requirements resulting from idiosyncratic systemic and combination stress events and regulatory liquidity requirements in a timely manner from stable and costefficient funding sources we seek to accomplish this goal by funding loans with stable deposits by prudently controlling dependence on wholesale funding particularly shortterm unsecured funding and by maintaining ample available

the acl decreased from billion at december to billion at june reflecting a reserve release of million to determine the acl as of june we utilized an economic forecast that generally reflects real gdp growth of approximately over the forecast also projects the unemployment rate to be in the range of to throughout this forecast reflects an overall improved macroeconomic outlook as compared to december in addition to judgment applied to the commercial portfolio as a whole we continued to apply management judgment to adjust the modeled reserves in the commercial industry sectors most impacted by the covid19 pandemic and associated lockdowns including cre retail and hospitality and casual dining our determination of the acl is sensitive to changes in forecasted macroeconomic conditions during the reasonable and supportable period to illustrate we applied a more pessimistic scenario than that described above which assumes that challenges in acceptance of vaccines cause covid19related infections to abet later than in our base case scenario with concerns rising about resistant strains consumer spending is slower to rebound with businesses reopening more slowly and vacation spending muted this pessimistic scenario reflects real gdp growth of approximately and unemployment in the range of to over excluding consideration of qualitative adjustments this scenario would result in a quantitative lifetime loss estimate of approximately our modeled periodend acl or an increase of approximately million this analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimate and not to the overall periodend acl which includes qualitative adjustments because several quantitative and qualitative factors are considered in determining the acl this sensitivity analysis does not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the acl or even what the acl would be under these economic circumstances the sensitivity is intended to provide insights into the impact of adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment and the corresponding impact to modeled loss estimates the hypothetical determination does not incorporate the impact of management judgment or other qualitative factors that could be applied in the actual estimation of the acl and does not imply any expectation of future deterioration in our loss rates to provide additional context regarding sensitivity to more pessimistic scenarios our acl balance of billion represents of the billion of n inequarter losses projected in the federal reserve run of the december supervisory

comparatively our acl represents of the billion of projected losses in the company run results of the supervisory severely adverse scenario losses projected under the company supervisory severely adverse scenario are lower than the federal reserve results due to methodology and modeling differences as an example the federal reserves models did not recognize contractual loss sharing arrangements in the merchant loan portfolio both the company and federal reserve results include incremental losses associated with loan originations assumed postjune in contrast our june acl balance considers only existing loans and lines of credit as of the reporting date while the recovery path is clearer than it was at the end of the fourth quarter significant future uncertainty still exists including progress in the rollout acceptance and effectiveness of covid19 vaccines it remains difficult to estimate how changes in economic forecasts might affect our acl because such forecasts citizens financial group inc consider a wide variety of variables and inputs and changes in the variables and inputs may not occur at the same time or in the same direction and such changes may have differing impacts by product types the variables and inputs may be idiosyncratically affected by existing or future monetary and fiscal stimulus programs and forbearance and other customer accommodation efforts changes in one or multiple of the key variables may have a material impact to our estimation of expected credit losses we continue to monitor the impact of covid19 vaccination

exchange rates equity prices commodity prices andor other relevant market rates or prices modest market risk arises from trading activities that serve customer needs including hedging of interest rate and foreign exchange risk as described below more material market risk arises from our nontrading banking activities such as loan origination and depositgathering we have established enterprisewide policies and methodologies to identify measure monitor and report market risk we actively manage market risk for both nontrading and trading activities nontrading risk we are exposed to market risk as a result of nontrading banking activities this market risk is substantially composed of interest rate risk as we have no commodity risk and de minimis direct currency and equity risk we also have market risk related to capital markets loan originations as well as the valuation of our msrs there have been no significant changes in our sources of interest rate risk interest rate risk practices risk framework metrics or assumptions as described in market risk nontrading risk in our form 10k the table below reports net interest income exposures against a variety of interest rate scenarios our policies involve measuring exposures as a percentage change in net interest income over the next year due to either instantaneous or gradual parallel changes in rates relative to the market implied forward yield curve as the following table illustrates our balance sheet is asset sensitive net interest income would benefit from an increase in interest rates while exposure to a decline in interest rates is within limit while an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates is included in this analysis we believe that any actual shift in interest rates would likely be more gradual and therefore have a more modest impact citizens financial group inc the table below presents the sensitivity of net interest income to various parallel yield curve shifts from the market implied forward yield curve table sensitivity of net interest income estimated change in net interest income over months basis points june december instantaneous change in interest rates gradual change in interest rates we continue to manage asset sensitivity within the scope of our policy and changing market conditions asset sensitivity against a basis point gradual increase in rates remained fairly steady at as of june as compared to at december resulting from the addition of billion of receivefixedpayvariable interest rate swaps current levels of asset sensitivity are elevated relative to our core sensitivity profile due to meaningful increases in cash and deposit balances as a result of monetary and fiscal stimulus programs changes in interest rates can also affect the risk positions which impacts the repricing sensitivity or beta of the deposit base as well as the cash flows on assets that allow for early payoff without a penalty the risk position is managed within our risk limits and longterm view of interest rates through occasional adjustments to securities investments interest rate swaps and mix of funding we use a valuation measure of exposure to structural interest rate risk economic value of equity eve as a supplement to net interest income simulations eve complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure over a longterm horizon eve measures the extent to which the economic value of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates this analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with noncontractual maturities the change in value is expressed as a percentage of regulatory capital we use interest rate swap contracts to manage the interest rate exposure to variability in the interest cash flows on our floatingrate assets and floatingrate wholesale funding and to hedge market risk on fixedrate capital markets debt issuances

planned discontinuance in late we formed a libor transition program designed to guide the organization through the planned discontinuation of libor the program with direction and oversight from our chief financial officer is responsible for developing maintaining and executing against a coordinated strategy to ensure a timely and orderly transition from libor the program is structured to address various initiatives including program governance transition management communications exposure management new alternative reference rate product delivery risk management contract remediation operations and technology readiness accounting and reporting as well as tax and regulation impacts we have identified and are monitoring the risks associated with the libor transition on a quarterly basis the arrc recommended that banks be systemically and operationally capable of supporting transactions in alternative reference rates such as sofr by the end of september guided by this milestone we are systemically and operationally prepared to support alternative reference rate transactions on march the financial conduct authority fca formally announced the future cessation or loss of representation of the libor benchmark settings currently published by the intercontinental exchange ice benchmark administration further the fca stated that the 1week and 2month us dollar libor rates will cease as of december and all other us dollar libor tenors will cease as of june with the frb occ and fdic collectively the agencies supporting this announcement the libor transition program adjusted libor transition activities accordingly the agencies are still urging market participants to stop entering into new us dollar libor contracts as soon as practicable but no later than the end of we are continuing all efforts to move new originations to alternative reference rates over the course of however our plans for legacy contract remediation now extend through mid2023 more broadly program governance remains robust and progress has been made in the aboveoutlined initiatives as management continues to closely monitor industry and regulatory developments pertaining to the transition c apital markets a key component of our capital markets activities is the underwriting and distribution of corporate credit facilities to partially finance merger and acquisition transactions for our clients we have a rigorous risk management process around these activities including a limit structure capping our underwriting risk our potential loss and sub limits for specific asset classes further the ability to approve underwriting exposure is delegated only to senior level individuals in the credit risk management and capital markets organizations with each transaction adjudicated in the loan underwriting approval committee mortgage servicing rights we have market risk associated with the value of residential msrs which are impacted by various types of inherent risks including duration basis convexity volatility and yield curve as part of our overall risk management strategy relative to the fair market value of the msrs we enter into various freestanding derivatives such as interest rate swaps interest rate swaptions interest rate futures and forward contracts to purchase mortgagebacked securities to economically hedge the changes in fair value as of

riskbased activities earnings atrisk excludes the impact of msrs msrs are captured under our single price risk management framework that is used for calculating a management value at risk that is consistent with the definition used by banking regulators trading risk we are exposed to market risk primarily through client facilitation activities including derivatives and foreign exchange products as well as underwriting and market making activities exposure is created as a result of changes in interest rates and related basis spreads and volatility foreign exchange rates and credit
