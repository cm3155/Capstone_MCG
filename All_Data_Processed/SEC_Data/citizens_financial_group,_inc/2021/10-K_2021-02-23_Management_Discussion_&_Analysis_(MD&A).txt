and supplemental financial information it should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements in item as well as other information contained in this document nongaap financial measures this document contains nongaap financial measures denoted as underlying results underlying results for any given reporting period exclude certain items that may occur in that period which management does not consider indicative of our ongoing financial performance we believe these nongaap financial measures provide useful information to investors because they are used by management to evaluate our operating performance and make daytoday operating decisions in addition we believe our underlying results in any given reporting period reflect our ongoing financial performance and increase comparability of periodtoperiod results and accordingly are useful to consider in addition to our gaap financial results other companies may use similarly titled nongaap financial measures that are calculated differently from the way we calculate such measures accordingly our nongaap financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by such companies we caution investors not to place undue reliance on such nongaap financial measures but to consider them with the most directly comparable gaap measures nongaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our results reported under gaap nongaap measures are denoted throughout our mda by the use of the term nongaap or underlying and where there is a reference to nongaap or underlying results in that paragraph all measures that follow that reference are on the same basis

with net interest income net interest income is our largest source of revenue and is the difference between the interest earned on interestearning assets generally loans leases and investment securities and the interest expense incurred in connection with interestbearing liabilities generally deposits and borrowed funds the level of net interest income is primarily a function of the difference between the effective yield on our average interestearning assets and the effective cost of our interestbearing liabilities these factors are influenced by the pricing and mix of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities which in turn are impacted by external factors such as local economic conditions competition for loans and deposits the monetary policy of the

business operating segments consumer banking and commercial banking segment results are derived by specifically attributing managed assets liabilities capital and related revenues provision for credit

chargeoffs is reflected in other nonsegment operations are classified as other which includes corporate functions the treasury function the securities portfolio wholesale funding activities intangible assets not directly allocated to a business operating segment community development noncore assets and other unallocated assets liabilities capital revenues provision for credit losses expenses and income tax expense in addition other includes goodwill not directly allocated to a business operating segment and any associated goodwill impairment charges for impairment testing purposes we allocate all goodwill to our consumer banking andor commercial banking reporting units our capital levels are evaluated and managed centrally however capital is allocated on a riskadjusted basis to the business operating segments to support evaluation of business performance because funding and asset liability management is a central function funds transferpricing ftp methodologies are utilized to allocate a cost of funds used or credit for the funds provided to all business operating segment assets liabilities and capital respectively using a matchedfunding concept the residual effect on net interest income of assetliability management including the residual net interest income related to the ftp process is included in other we periodically evaluate and refine our methodologies used to measure financial performance of our business operating segments noninterest income and expense are directly attributed to each business operating segment including fees service charges salaries and benefits and other direct revenues and costs and are respectively accounted for in a manner similar to our consolidated financial statements occupancy costs are allocated based on utilization of facilities by each business operating segment noninterest expenses incurred by centrally managed operations or business operating segments that directly support another business operating segments operations are charged to the applicable business operating segment based on its utilization of those services income tax expense is assessed to each business operating segment at a standard tax rate with the residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate included in other developing and applying methodologies used to allocate items among the business operating segments is a dynamic process accordingly financial results may be revised periodically as management systems are enhanced methods of evaluating performance or product lines are updated or our

extension of var but uses a longer historical lookback horizon that is fixed from january this is done not only to identify headline risks from more volatile periods but also to provide a counterbalance to var which may be low during periods of low volatility the holding period for profit and loss determination is ten days in addition to risk management purposes svar is also a component of market risk regulatory capital we calculate svar daily under its own dynamic window regime in a dynamic window regime values of the tenday var are calculated over all possible 260day periods that can be obtained from the complete historical data set refer to market risk regulatory capital above for details of svar metrics including high low average and period end svar for the combined portfolio sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is the measure of exposure to a single risk factor such as a one basis point change in rates or credit spread we conduct and monitor sensitivity on interest rates basis spreads foreign exchange exposures option prices and credit spreads whereas var is based on previous moves in market risk factors over recent periods it may not be an accurate predictor of future market moves sensitivity analysis complements var as it provides an indication of risk relative to each factor irrespective of historical market moves and is an effective tool in evaluating the appropriateness of hedging strategies and concentrations stress testing conducting a stress test of a portfolio consists of running risk models with the inclusion of key variables that simulate various historical or hypothetical scenarios for historical stress tests profit and loss results are simulated for selected time periods corresponding to the most volatile underlying returns while hypothetical stress tests aim to consider concentration risk illiquidity under stressed market conditions and risk arising from our trading activities that may not be fully captured by our other risk measurement methodologies hypothetical scenarios also assume that market moves happen simultaneously and no repositioning or hedging activity takes place to mitigate losses as market events unfold we generate stress tests of our trading positions on a daily basis for example we currently include a stress test that simulates a lehmantype crisis scenario by taking table start citizens financial group inc table end the worst 20trading day peak to trough moves for the various risk factors that go into var from that period and assumes they occurred simultaneously var model review and validation market risk measurement models used are independently reviewed and subject to ongoing performance analysis by the model owners the independent review and validation focuses on the model methodology market data and performance independent review of market risk measurement models is the responsibility of citizens model risk management and validation team aspects covered include challenging the assumptions used the quantitative techniques employed and the theoretical justification underpinning them and an assessment of the soundness of the required data over time where possible the quantitative impact of the major underlying modeling assumptions will be estimated eg through developing alternative models results of such reviews are shared with our us banking regulators the market risk models may be periodically enhanced due to changes in market price levels and price action regime behavior the market risk management and validation team will conduct internal validation before a new or changed model element is implemented and before a change is made to a market data mapping var backtesting backtesting is one form of validation of the var model and is run daily the market risk rule requires a comparison of our internal var measure to the actual net trading revenue excluding fees commissions reserves intraday trading and net interest income for each day over the preceding year the most recent business days any observed loss in excess of the var number is taken as an exception the level of exceptions determines the multiplication factor used to derive the var and svarbased capital requirement for regulatory reporting purposes when applicable we perform subportfolio backtesting as required under the market risk rule using models approved by our banking regulators for interest rate credit spread and foreign exchange positions the following graph shows our daily net trading revenue and total internal modeled var for the year ended
