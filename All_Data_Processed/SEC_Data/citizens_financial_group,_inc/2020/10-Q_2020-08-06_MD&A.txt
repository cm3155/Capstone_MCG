the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements include all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods the results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and

impairment guidance for securities afs to incorporate an allowance which allows for reversals of impairment losses in the event that the credit of an issuer improves requires a cumulativeeffect adjustment to retained earnings net of taxes as of the beginning of the reporting period of adoption requires enhanced credit quality disclosures including disaggregation of credit quality indicators by vintage the company adopted the new standard on january retrospectively for loans and leases and htm securities and prospectively for afs securities refer to note for discussion of the significant accounting policy for the allowance for credit losses following adoption adoption resulted in a cumulativeeffect reduction of million net of taxes of million to retained earnings and a corresponding increase to the acl of million refer to note for the impact of the adoption to the alll and reserve for unfunded commitments the increase in acl upon adoption will decrease the companys cet1 capital ratio by basis points on a fullyphased in basis following a twoyear delay this capital impact will be phasedin by per year or approximately basis points beginning on january through january adoption of the new standard could produce higher volatility in the quarterly provision for credit losses than the prior incurred loss reserve process and could adversely impact the companys ongoing earnings based on the credit quality of the companys existing debt securities portfolio the company did not recognize an allowance for htm and afs debt securities upon adoption goodwill issued january requires an impairment loss to be recognized when the estimated fair value of a reporting unit falls below its carrying value eliminates the second condition in the current guidance that requires an impairment loss to be recognized only if the estimated implied fair value of the goodwill is below its carrying value applied prospectively to all goodwill impairment tests performed after the adoption date the

against fhlb borrowed funds pledged against derivatives to qualify for fiduciary powers and to secure public and other deposits as required by law citizens regularly enters into security repurchase agreements with unrelated counterparties which involve the transfer of a security from one party to another and a subsequent transfer of substantially the same security back to the original party the companys repurchase agreements are typically shortterm in nature and are accounted for as secured borrowed funds on the companys consolidated balance sheets citizens recognized no offsetting of shortterm receivables or payables as of june or december citizens offsets certain derivative assets and derivative liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets for further information see note there were no securitizations of mortgage loans retained in the investment portfolio for the three and six months ended june securitizations of mortgage loans retained in the investment portfolio were million for the three months ended june and million for the six months ended june these securitizations include a substantive guarantee by a third party in the guarantors were fnma fhlmc and gnma the debt securities received from the guarantors are classified as afs impairment upon purchase of htm investment securities and each subsequent measurement period citizens recognizes a reserve for credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the security even if the risk of loss is remote recognition of a reserve for expected credit losses is not required if the amount the company expects to realize is zero commonly referred to as zero expected credit losses the company evaluated its existing htm portfolio and concluded that all of the securities met the zero expected credit loss criteria and therefore no cecl reserve was booked for htm securities as of the balance sheet date citizens reviews its afs debt securities for impairment at the individual security level on a quarterly basis or more frequently if a potential loss triggering event occurs the initial indicator of impairment for debt securities classified as afs is a decline in fair value below its amortized cost basis for any security that has declined in fair value below the amortized cost basis the company recognizes an impairment loss in current period earnings if management has the intent to sell the security or if it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis estimating the recovery of the amortized cost basis of a debt security is based upon an assessment of the cash flows expected to be collected if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected discounted at the securitys original effective yield is less than the amortized cost basis impairment equal to the shortfall in cash flows has occurred citizens evaluates whether any portion of the impairment is attributable to creditrelated factors or various other market factors affecting the fair value of the security eg interest rates spread levels liquidity in the sector etc and the public credit rating of the security if creditrelated factors exist creditrelated impairment has occurred regardless of the companys intent to hold the security until it recovers the creditrelated portion of impairment is recognized in current period earnings as provision expense through the establishment of an allowance for afs securities to the extent the allowance does not reduce the value of the afs security below its current fair value the remaining noncredit related portion of impairment is recognized in oci improvement in credit losses in subsequent periods results in a reversal of the allowance for afs securities and a corresponding decrease to provision expense to the extent the allowance does not become negative accrued interest receivable on afs debt securities is excluded from the balances used to calculate the allowance for afs securities all accrued and uncollected interest is immediately reversed against interest income when it is deemed uncollectible the company has evaluated any afs securities in an unrealized loss position at june and concluded that all unrealized losses are due to noncredit related factors as such the company does not have an allowance for afs securities as of june citizens financial group inc the following table

unrealized losses federal agencies and us government sponsored entities citizens does not currently have the intent to sell these impaired debt securities and it is not more likely than not that the company will be required to sell these debt securities prior to recovery of their amortized cost bases citizens has determined that credit losses are not expected to be incurred on the remaining agency and nonagency mbs identified with unrealized losses as of june the unrealized losses on these debt securities reflect noncreditrelated factors such as changing interest rates and market liquidity therefore citizens has determined that these debt securities are not otherthantemporarily impaired any subsequent increases in the valuation of impaired debt securities will not impact their

concentrations of credit risk allowance for credit losses managements estimate of expected credit losses in the companys loan and lease portfolios is recorded in the alll and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments collectively the acl see note in the companys form 10k for a detailed discussion of the acl reserve methodology and estimation techniques as of december upon adoption of cecl effective january the companys acl reserve methodology changed to estimate expected credit losses over the contractual life of the loans and leases the acl is maintained at a level the company believes to be appropriate to absorb expected lifetime credit losses over the contractual life of the loan and lease portfolios and on the unfunded lending commitments the determination of the acl is based on periodic evaluation of the loan and lease portfolios and unfunded lending commitments that are not unconditionally cancelable considering a number of relevant underlying factors including key assumptions and evaluation of quantitative and qualitative information key assumptions used in the acl measurement process include the use of a twoyear reasonable and supportable economic forecast period followed by a oneyear period during which the expected credit losses revert to longterm historical macroeconomic inputs citizens financial group inc the evaluation of quantitative and qualitative information is performed through assessments of groups of assets that share similar risk characteristics and certain individual loans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics with the collective group loans are grouped generally by product type eg commercial commercial real estate residential mortgage etc and significant loan portfolios are assessed for credit losses using econometric models the quantitative evaluation of the adequacy of the acl utilizes a single economic forecast and is primarily based on econometric models that use known or estimated data as of the balance sheet date and forecasted data over the reasonable and supportable period known and estimated data include current pd lgd and ead for commercial loans and leases timing and amount of expected draws for unfunded lending commitments mix and level of loan balances delinquency levels assigned risk ratings previous loss experience current business conditions amounts and timing of expected future cash flows and factors particular to a specific commercial credit such as competition business and management performance forwardlooking economic assumptions include real gross domestic product unemployment rate interest rate curve and changes in collateral values this data is aggregated to estimate expected credit losses over the contractual life of the loans and leases adjusted for expected prepayments in highly volatile economic environments historical information such as commercial customer financial statements or consumer credit ratings may not be as important to estimating future expected losses as forecasted inputs to the models the acl may also be affected materially by a variety of qualitative factors that the company considers to reflect current judgment of various events and risks that are not measured in the statistical procedures including uncertainty related to the economic forecasts used in the modeled credit loss estimates loan growth back testing results credit underwriting policy exceptions regulatory and audit findings and peer comparisons the qualitative allowance is further informed by multiple alternative scenarios to support the periodend acl balance the measurement process results in specific or pooled allowances for loans leases and unfunded lending commitments and qualitative allowances that are judgmentally determined and applied across the portfolio there are certain loan portfolios that may not need an econometric model to enable the company to calculate managements best estimate of the expected credit losses less data intensive nonmodeled approaches to estimating losses are considered more efficient and practical for portfolios that have lower levels of outstanding balances eg runoff or closed portfolios new products or products that are not significant to the companys overall credit risk exposure loans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics are individually assessed for expected credit losses nonaccruing commercial and commercial real estate loans with an outstanding balance of million or greater and all commercial and commercial real estate tdrs regardless of size are assessed on an individual loan level basis generally the measurement of acl on individual loans and leases is the present value of its future cash flows or the fair value of its underlying collateral if the loan or lease is collateral dependent loans that are deemed to be collateral dependent are written down to the fair value less costs to sell if sale of the collateral is expected as of the evaluation date and are reassessed each subsequent period to determine if a change to the acl is required subsequent evaluations may result in an increase or decrease to the acl based on a corresponding change in the fair value of the collateral during the period any subsequent decrease to the acl because of an increase to the collateraldependent loans fair value is limited to the total amount previously written off for that loan for retail tdrs that are not collateral dependent the acl is developed using the present value of expected future cash flows compared to the amortized cost basis in the loans expected redefault factors are considered in this analysis retail tdrs that are deemed collateral dependent are written down to fair market value less cost to sell expected recoveries are considered in managements estimate of the acl and may result in a negative adjustment ie reduction to the acl balance a loan is collateral dependent if repayment

associated with the acquisition of a business and is assigned to the companys reporting units at the acquisition date a reporting unit is a business operating segment or a component of a business operating segment citizens has identified and assigned goodwill to two reporting units consumer banking and commercial banking based upon reviews of the structure of the companys executive team and supporting functions resource allocations and financial reporting processes once goodwill has been assigned to reporting units it no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition and all of the activities within a reporting unit whether acquired or organically grown are available to support the value of the goodwill goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests citizens reviews goodwill for impairment annually as of october st and in interim periods when events or changes indicate the carrying value of one or more reporting units may not be recoverable the company has the option of performing a qualitative assessment of goodwill to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than the carrying value if it is more likely than not that the fair value exceeds the carrying value then no further testing is necessary otherwise citizens must perform a quantitative assessment of goodwill citizens may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative assessment the quantitative assessment used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting units fair value to its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value inclusive of goodwill applicable goodwill is deemed to be not impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit inclusive of goodwill exceeds its fair value an impairment charge is recorded for the excess the impairment loss recognized cannot exceed the amount of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit and the loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted under the quantitative impairment assessment the fair values of the companys reporting units are determined using a combination of income and marketbased approaches citizens relies on the income approach discounted cash flow method for determining fair value market and transaction approaches are used as benchmarks only to corroborate the value determined by the discounted cash flow method citizens relies on several assumptions when estimating the fair value of its reporting units using the discounted cash flow method these assumptions include the discount rate as well as projected loan loss income tax and capital retention rates discount rates are estimated based on the capital asset pricing model which considers the riskfree interest rate market risk premium beta and size premium adjustments specific to a particular reporting unit the discount rates are also calibrated on the assessment of the risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit cash flow projections include estimates for projected loan loss income tax and capital retention rates multiyear financial forecasts are developed for each reporting unit by considering several key business drivers such as new citizens financial group inc business initiatives customer retention standards market share changes anticipated loan and deposit growth forward interest rates historical performance and industry and economic trends among other considerations the longterm growth rate used in determining the terminal value of each reporting unit is estimated based on managements assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of each reporting unit as well as broader economic considerations such as gdp and inflation in economic conditions deteriorated significantly with the spread of the covid19 pandemic the outbreak resulted in social distancing requirements throughout the world severely restricting the economy in response to the crisis the federal reserve lowered the federal funds rate in march to close to zero additionally the us government initiated numerous measures to support the economy including the cares act given the current macroeconomic environment citizens assessed whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units was less than carrying value as of june impairment indicators evaluated included economic conditions including projections of the duration of current conditions and timing of a potential recovery industry and market considerations government intervention and regulatory updates the impact of recent events to financial performance and cost factors of the reporting units performance of the companys stock and other relevant events citizens further considered the amount by which fair value exceeded book value for each unit in the most recent quantitative analysis and sensitivities performed at the conclusion of the assessment the company determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value as of june the interim assessment of goodwill impairment included evaluation of various factors that continue to rapidly evolve and for which significant uncertainty remains including future growth rates and operating margins the impact of the covid19 pandemic to the economy and ongoing government intervention to mitigate that impact further weakening in the economic environment such as continued decline in the performance of the reporting units or other factors could cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below their carrying value resulting in a goodwill impairment charge additionally new legislative or regulatory changes not anticipated in managements expectations may cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below the carrying value resulting in a goodwill impairment charge any impairment charge would not affect the companys regulatory capital ratios tangible common equity ratio or liquidity position the change in the carrying value of
