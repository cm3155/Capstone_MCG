aspects of our results of operations and our financial condition including the levels and trends of the line items included in our balance sheet and statement of operations used in calculating various key performance metrics commonly used in our industry the primary line items we use in calculating our key performance metrics to manage and evaluate our statement of operations include net interest income noninterest income total revenue provision for credit losses noninterest expense net income and net income available to common stockholders the primary line items we use in calculating our key performance metrics to manage and evaluate our balance sheet data include loans and leases securities allowance for credit losses deposits borrowed funds and derivatives we analyze these key performance metrics and financial trends against our own historical performance our budgeted performance and the financial condition and performance of comparable banking institutions in our region and nationally we consider the following key performance metrics when evaluating our performance and making daytoday operating decisions as well as evaluating capital utilization and adequacy including table start return on average tangible common equity which we define as annualized net income available to common stockholders divided by average common equity excluding average goodwill net of related deferred tax liability and average other intangibles table endtable start efficiency ratio which we define as the ratio of total noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income and total noninterest income the efficiency ratio helps us to evaluate the efficiency of our operations as it helps us monitor how costs are changing compared to income a decrease in the efficiency ratio

interest income net interest income is our largest source of revenue and is the difference between the interest earned on interestearning assets generally loans leases and investment securities and the interest expense incurred in connection with interestbearing liabilities generally deposits and borrowed funds the level of net interest income is primarily a function of the difference between the effective yield on our average interestearning assets and the effective cost of our interestbearing liabilities these factors are influenced by the pricing and mix of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities which in turn are impacted by external factors such as local economic conditions competition for loans and deposits the monetary policy of the frb and market interest rates

collateral values and factors particular to table start citizens financial group inc table end a specific commercial credit such as competition business and management performance the alll may be adjusted to reflect our current assessment of various qualitative risks factors and events that may not be measured in our statistical procedures there is no certainty that the alll and reserve for unfunded lending commitments will be appropriate over time to cover losses because of unanticipated adverse changes in any of these internal external or qualitative factors there were no material changes in assumptions or estimation techniques compared with prior years that impacted the determination of the current years alll and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments the evaluation of the adequacy of the commercial commercial real estate and lease alll and reserve for unfunded lending commitments is primarily based on risk rating models that assess probability of default pd loss given default lgd and exposure at default on an individual loan basis the models are primarily driven by individual customer financial characteristics and are validated against historical experience additionally qualitative factors are included in the risk rating models after the aggregation of individual borrower incurred loss additional overlays can be made based on backtesting against historical losses and forward loss curve ratios for nonaccruing commercial and commercial real estate loans with an outstanding balance of million or greater and for all commercial and commercial real estate tdrs regardless of size we conduct specific analysis on a loan level basis to determine the probable amount of credit loss if appropriate a specific alll is established for the loan through a charge to the provision for credit losses for all classes of impaired loans individual loan measures of impairment may result in a chargeoff to the alll if deemed appropriate in such cases the provision for credit losses is not affected when a specific reserve for at least that amount already exists techniques utilized include comparing the loans carrying amount to the estimated present value of its future cash flows the fair value of its underlying collateral or the loans observable market price the technique applied to each impaired loan is based on the workout officers opinion of the most probable workout scenario historically this has generally led to the use of the estimated present value of future cash flows approach the fair value of underlying collateral will be used if the loan is deemed collateral dependent for loans that use the fair value of underlying collateral approach a chargeoff assessment is performed quarterly to write the loans down for declines in value to fair value less cost to sell for most nonimpaired retail loan portfolio types the alll is based upon the incurred loss model utilizing the pd lgd and exposure at default on an individual loan basis when developing these factors we may consider the loan product and collateral type delinquency status ltv ratio lien position borrowers credit time outstanding geographic location and incurred loss period incurred loss periods are reviewed and updated at least annually and potentially more frequently when economic situations change rapidly as they tend to fluctuate with economic cycles incurred loss periods are generally longer in good economic times and shorter in bad times certain retail portfolios including education unsecured personal loans sbo home equity loans and credit card receivables utilize roll rate or vintage models to estimate the alll for home equity lines and loans a number of factors impact the pd specifically the borrowers current fico score the utilization rate delinquency statistics borrower income current cltv ratio and months on books are all used to assess the borrowers creditworthiness similarly lgd is also impacted by various factors including the utilization rate the cltv ratio the lien position the housing price index change for the location as measured by the caseshiller index age of the loan and current loan balance when we are not in a first lien position we use delinquency information on the first lien exposures obtained from thirdparty credit information providers in the credit assessment for all first liens whether owned by a third party or by us an additional assessment is performed on a quarterly basis in this assessment the most recent three months performance of the senior liens is reviewed for delinquency days or more past due modification foreclosure andor bankruptcy statuses if any derogatory status is present the junior lien will be placed on nonaccrual status regardless of its delinquency status on our books this subsequent change to nonaccrual status will alter the treatment in the pd model thus affecting the reserve calculation in addition the first lien exposure is combined with the second lien exposure to generate a cltv the cltv is a more accurate reflection of the leverage of the borrower against the property value as compared to the ltv from just the junior liens the cltv is used for modeling both the junior lien pd and lgd this also impacts the alll rates for the junior lien helocs the above measures are all used to assess the pd and lgd for heloc borrowers for whom we originated the loans for retail tdrs that are not collateraldependent allowances are developed using the present value of expected future cash flows compared to the recorded investment in the loans expected redefault factors are considered in this analysis retail tdrs that are deemed collateraldependent are written down to the fair market table start citizens financial group inc table end value of the collateral less costs to sell the fair value of collateral is periodically monitored subsequent to the modification changes in the levels of estimated losses can significantly affect managements determination of an appropriate alll for retail loans losses are affected by such factors as loss severity collateral values economic conditions and other factors a one basis point and five basis point increase in the estimated loss rate for retail loans at december would have increased the alll by million and million respectively the alll for our commercial banking segment is sensitive to assigned credit risk ratings and inherent loss rates if and of the december year end loan balances including unfunded commitments within each risk rating category of our commercial banking segment had experienced downgrades of two risk categories the alll would have increased by million and million respectively commercial loans and leases are charged off to the alll when there is little prospect of collecting either principal or interest chargeoffs of commercial loans and leases usually involve receipt of borrowerspecific adverse information for commercial collateraldependent loans an appraisal or other valuation is used to quantify a shortfall between the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell and the recorded investment in the commercial loan retail loan chargeoffs are generally based on established delinquency thresholds rather than borrowerspecific adverse information when a loan is collateraldependent any shortfalls between the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell and the recorded investment is promptly charged off placing any loan or lease on nonaccrual status does not by itself require a partial or total chargeoff however any identified losses are charged off at that time for additional information regarding the alll and reserve for unfunded lending commitments see note and note in item fair value we measure fair value using the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date fair value is based upon quoted market prices in an active market where available if quoted prices are not available observable marketbased inputs or independently sourced parameters are used to develop fair value whenever possible such inputs may include prices of similar assets or liabilities yield curves interest rates prepayment speeds and foreign exchange rates we classify our assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value in accordance with the threelevel valuation hierarchy table start level quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities table endtable start level observable inputs other than level prices such as quoted prices for similar instruments quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability and table endtable start level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market information and that are significant to the fair value measurement table end classification in the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the asset or liability for instruments classified in level and where inputs are primarily based upon observable market data there is less judgment applied in arriving at the fair value for instruments classified in level management judgment is more significant due to the lack of observable market data we review and update the fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis changes from one quarter to the next related to the observability of inputs in fair value measurements may result in a reclassification between the fair value hierarchy levels and are recognized based on yearend balances we also verify the accuracy of the pricing provided by our primary external pricing service on a quarterly basis this process involves using a secondary external vendor to provide valuations for our securities portfolio for comparison purposes any securities with discrepancies beyond a certain threshold are researched and if necessary valued by an independent outside broker fair value is also used on a nonrecurring basis to evaluate certain assets for impairment or for disclosure purposes examples of nonrecurring uses of fair value include mortgage servicing rights accounted for by the amortization method loan impairments for certain loans and goodwill the fair value of assets under operating leases is determined using collateral specific pricing digests external appraisals broker opinions recent sales data from industry equipment dealers and the discounted cash flows table start citizens financial group inc table end derived from the underlying lease agreement as market data for similar assets and lease agreements is available and used in the valuation these assets are classified as level msrs do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices msrs are classified as level since the valuation methodology utilizes significant unobservable inputs the fair value was calculated using a discounted cash flow model which used assumptions including weightedaverage life prepayment assumptions and weightedaverage option adjusted spread it is important to note that changes in our assumptions may not be independent of each other changes in one assumption may result in changes to another eg changes in interest rates which are inversely correlated to changes in prepayment rates may result in changes to discount rates which could impact sensitivities the underlying assumptions and estimated values are corroborated by values received from independent third parties based on their review of the servicing portfolio and comparisons to market transactions in addition the msr policy is approved by the asset liability

applicant when approving customers for a new loan or extension of an existing credit line credit scores are used in conjunction with other credit risk variables such as affordability length of term collateral value collateral type and lien subordination to ensure proper oversight of the underwriting teams lending authority is granted by the second line of defense credit risk function to each underwriter the amount of delegated authority depends on the experience of the individual we periodically evaluate the performance of each underwriter and annually reauthorize their delegated authority only senior members of the second line of defense credit risk team are authorized to approve significant exceptions to credit policies it is not uncommon to make exceptions to established policies when compensating factors are present there are exception limits which when reached trigger a comprehensive analysis table start citizens financial group inc table end once an account is established credit scores and collateral values are refreshed at regular intervals to allow for proactive identification of increasing or decreasing levels of credit risk our approach to managing credit risk is highly analytical and where appropriate is automated to ensure consistency and efficiency commercial on the commercial banking side of credit risk the structure is broken into ci loans and leases and cre within ci loans and leases there are separate verticals established for certain specialty products eg assetbased lending leasing franchise finance health care and technology midcorporate a specialty vertical is a standalone team of industry or product specialists substantially all activity that falls under the ambit of the defined industry or product is managed through a specialty vertical when one exists cre also operates as a specialty vertical commercial credit risk management begins with defined credit products and policies commercial transactions are subject to individual analysis and approval at origination and with few exceptions are subject to a formal annual review requirement the underwriting process includes the establishment and approval of credit grades that confirm the pd and lgd all material transactions then require the approval of both a business line approver and an independent credit approver with the requisite level of delegated authority the approval level of a particular credit facility is determined by the size of the credit relationship as well as the pd the checks and balances in the credit process and the independence of the credit approver function are designed to appropriately assess and sanction the level of credit risk being accepted facilitate the early recognition of credit problems when they occur and to provide for effective problem asset management and resolution all authority to grant credit is delegated through the independent credit risk function and is closely monitored and regularly updated the primary factors considered in commercial credit approvals are the financial strength of the borrower assessment of the borrowers management capabilities cash flows from operations industry sector trends type and sufficiency of collateral type of exposure transaction structure and the general economic outlook while these are the primary factors considered there are a number of other factors that may be considered in the decision process in addition to the credit analysis conducted during the approval process at origination and annual review our credit quality assurance group performs testing to provide an independent review and assessment of the quality of the portfolio and new originations this group conducts portfolio reviews on a riskbased cycle to evaluate individual loans and validate risk ratings as well as test the consistency of the credit processes and the effectiveness of credit risk management the maximum level of credit exposure to individual credit borrowers is limited by policy guidelines based on the perceived risk of each borrower or related group of borrowers concentration risk is managed through limits on industry asset class and loan quality factors we focus predominantly on extending credit to commercial customers with existing or expandable relationships within our primary markets for this purpose defined as our state footprint plus contiguous states although we do engage in lending opportunities outside our primary markets if we believe that the associated risks are acceptable and aligned with strategic initiatives substantially all loans categorized as classified are managed by a specialized group of credit professionals market risk market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices commodity prices andor other relevant market rates or prices modest market risk arises from trading activities that serve customer needs including hedging of interest rate and foreign exchange risk as described below more material market risk arises from our nontrading banking activities such as loan origination and depositgathering we have established enterprisewide policies and methodologies to identify measure monitor and report market risk we actively manage market risk for both trading and nontrading activities nontrading risk we are exposed to market risk as a result of nontrading banking activities this market risk is substantially composed of interest rate risk as we have no commodity risk and de minimis direct currency and equity risk we also have market risk related to capital markets loan originations as well as the valuation of our msrs interest rate risk interest rate risk emerges from the balance sheet after the aggregation of our assets liabilities and equity we refer to this nontrading risk embedded in the balance sheet as structural interest rate risk or interest rate risk in the banking book table start citizens financial group inc table end a major source of structural interest rate risk is a difference in the repricing of assets relative to liabilities and equity there are differences in the timing and drivers of rate changes reflecting the maturity andor repricing of assets and liabilities for example the rate earned on a commercial loan may reprice monthly with changes in libor while the rate paid on debt or certificates of deposit may be fixed for a longer period there may also be differences in the drivers of rate changes loans may be tied to a specific index rate such as libor or prime while deposits may be only loosely correlated with libor and dependent upon competitive demand due to these basis differences net interest income is sensitive to changes in spreads between certain indices or repricing rates another important source of structural interest rate risk relates to the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options for example most consumer loans can be prepaid without penalty and most consumer deposits can also be withdrawn without penalty the exercise of such options by customers can exacerbate the timing differences discussed above a primary source of our structural interest rate risk relates to faster repricing of floatingrate loans relative to retail deposit funding this source of asset sensitivity is more biased toward the short end of the yield curve after a period of slowly raising shortterm rates to a more neutral stance the frb adjusted their policy stance with a midcycle adjustment reducing short term rates by basis points in as this shift occurred we reduced our asset sensitivity to a more moderate level to account for the less certain outlook for policy rates the secondary source of our interest rate risk is driven by longer term rates comprising the rollover or reinvestment risk on fixedrate loans as well as prepayment risk on mortgagerelated loans and securities funded by nonrate sensitive deposits and equity the primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk within policy limits approved by our board these limits and guidelines reflect our tolerance for interest rate risk over both shortterm and longterm horizons to ensure that exposure to interest rate risk is managed within our risk appetite we must measure the exposure and hedge it as necessary the treasury asset and liability management team is responsible for measuring monitoring and reporting on our structural interest rate risk position these exposures are reported on a monthly basis to the asset liability committee and at board meetings we measure structural interest rate risk through a variety of metrics intended to quantify both shortterm and longterm exposures the primary method we use to quantify interest rate risk is simulation analysis in which we model net interest income from assets liabilities and hedge derivative positions under various interest rate scenarios over a threeyear horizon exposure to interest rate risk is reflected in the variation of forecasted net interest income across the scenarios key assumptions in this simulation analysis relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads the changes in product balances and the behavior of loan and deposit clients in different rate environments the most material of these behavioral assumptions relate to the repricing characteristics and balance fluctuations of deposits with indeterminate ie noncontractual maturities as well as the pace of mortgage prepayments assessments are periodically made by running sensitivity analyses to determine the impact of key assumptions the results of these analyses are reported to the asset liability committee as the future path of interest rates cannot be known in advance we use simulation analysis to project net interest income under various interest rate scenarios including a most likely implied forward scenario as well as a variety of deliberately extreme and perhaps unlikely scenarios these scenarios may assume gradual ramping of the overall level of interest rates immediate shocks to the level of rates and various yield curve twists in which movements in short or longterm rates predominate generally projected net interest income in any interest rate scenario is compared to net interest income in a base case where market forward rates are realized the table below reports net interest income exposures against a variety of interest rate scenarios our policies involve measuring exposures as a percentage change in net interest income over the next year due to either instantaneous or gradual parallel changes in rates relative to the market implied forward yield curve as the following table illustrates our balance sheet is assetsensitive net interest income would benefit from an increase in interest rates while exposure to a decline in interest rates is within limit while an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis we believe that any actual shift in interest rates would likely be more gradual and therefore have a more modest impact table start citizens financial group inc table end the table below presents the sensitivity of net interest income to various parallel yield curve shifts from the market implied forward yield curve table start estimated change in net interest income over months december basis points instantaneous change in interest rates gradual change in interest rates table end given broad expectations that the frb will maintain its current policy stance we continue to manage asset sensitivity within the scope of our policy and changing market conditions asset sensitivity against a basis point gradual increase in rates was at december compared with at december additionally approximately to of this asset sensitivity is tied to longterm interest rate exposure greater than six months the risk position can be affected by changes in interest rates which impact the repricing sensitivity or beta of the deposit base as well as the cash flows on assets that allow for early payoff without a penalty the risk position is managed within our risk limits and long term view of interest rates through occasional adjustments to securities investments interest rate swaps and mix of funding we use a valuation measure of exposure to structural interest rate risk economic value of equity eve as a supplement to net interest income simulations eve complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure over a longterm horizon eve measures the extent to which the economic value of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates this analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with noncontractual maturities the change in value is expressed as a percentage of regulatory capital we use interest rate swap contracts to manage the interest rate exposure to variability in the interest cash flows on our floatingrate assets and floatingrate wholesale funding and to hedge market risk on fixedrate capital markets debt issuances the

underwriting and distribution of corporate credit facilities to partially finance mergers and acquisitions transactions for our clients we have a rigorous risk management process around these activities including a limit structure capping our underwriting risk our potential loss and sublimits for specific asset classes further the ability to approve underwriting exposure is delegated only to senior level individuals in the credit risk management and capital markets organizations with each transaction adjudicated in the loan underwriting approval committee mortgage servicing rights we have market risk associated with the value of residential msrs which are impacted by various types of inherent risks including risks related to duration basis convexity volatility and yield curve through december we had elected to account for the msrs acquired from famc at fair value while maintaining a lower of cost or market approach on our msrs held before the famc acquisition on january we elected to change our accounting treatment such that all msrs will be accounted for at fair value as part of our overall risk management strategy relative to the fair market value of the msrs we enter into various freestanding derivatives such as interest rate swaps interest rate swaptions interest rate futures and forward contracts to purchase mortgagebacked securities to economically hedge the changes in fair value as of december and the fair value of the famc msrs was million and million respectively and the total notional amount of related derivative contracts was billion and billion respectively gains and losses on msrs and the related derivatives used for hedging are included in mortgage banking fees on the consolidated statements of operations as of december and our msrs held before the famc acquisition had a book value of million and million respectively and were carried at the lower of cost or market as of december and these msrs had a fair value of million and million respectively which exceeded the carrying value at those dates as with our traded market riskbased activities earnings at risk excludes the impact of msrs msrs are captured under our single price risk management framework that is used for calculating a management value at risk that is consistent with the definition used by banking regulators as defined below trading risk we are exposed to market risk primarily through client facilitation activities including derivatives and foreign exchange products as well as underwriting and market making activities exposure is created as a result of changes in interest rates and related basis spreads and volatility foreign exchange rates and credit spreads on a select range of interest rates foreign exchange commodities corporate bonds and secondary loan instruments these trading activities are conducted through cbna and ccmi client facilitation activities consist primarily of interest rate derivatives financially settled commodity derivatives and foreign exchange contracts where we enter into offsetting trades with a separate counterparty or exchange to manage our market risk exposure in addition to the aforementioned activities we operate a secondary loan trading desk with the objective to meet secondary liquidity needs of our issuing clients transactions and investor clients we do not engage in any trading activities with the intent to benefit from shortterm price differences we record these rate derivatives and foreign exchange contracts as derivative assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets trading assets and liabilities are carried at fair value with income earned related to these activities included in net interest income changes in fair value of trading assets and liabilities are reflected in other income a component of noninterest income on the consolidated statements of operations market risk governance the market risk limit setting process is established inline with the formal enterprise risk appetite process and policy this appetite reflects the strategic and enterprise level articulation of opportunities for creating franchise value set to the boundaries of how much market risk to assume dealing authorities represent the key control tool in the management of market risk that allows the cascading of the risk appetite throughout the enterprise a dealing authority sets the operational scope and tolerances within which a business andor trading desk is permitted to operate which is reviewed at least annually dealing authorities are structured to accommodate client facing trades and hedges needed to manage the risk profile primary responsibility for keeping within established tolerances table start citizens financial group inc table end resides with the business key risk indicators including var open foreign currency positions and single name risk are monitored on a daily basis and reported against tolerances consistent with our risk appetite and business strategy to relevant business line management and risk counterparts market risk measurement we use var as a statistical measure for estimating potential exposure of our traded market risk in normal market conditions our var framework for risk management and regulatory reporting is the same risk management var is based on a one day holding period to a confidence level whereas regulatory var is based on a ten day holding period to the same confidence level in addition to var nonstatistical measurements for measuring risk are employed such as sensitivity analysis market value and stress testing our market risk platform and associated market risk and valuation models capture correlation effects across all our covered positions and allow for aggregation of market risk across products risk types business lines and legal entities we measure monitor and report market risk for both management and regulatory capital purposes var overview the market risk measurement model is based on historical simulation the var measure estimates the extent of any fair value losses on trading positions that may occur due to broad market movements general var such as changes in the level of interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices it is calculated on the basis that current positions remain broadly unaltered over the course of a given holding period it is assumed that markets are sufficiently liquid to allow the business to close its positions if required within this holding period vars benefit is that it captures the historic correlations of a portfolio based on the composition of our covered positions we also use a standardized addon approach for the loan trading desks specific risk capital which estimates the extent of any losses that may occur from factors other than broad market movements the general var approach is expressed in terms of a confidence level over the past trading days the internal var measure used as the basis of the main var trading limits is a confidence level with a one day holding period meaning that a loss greater than the var is expected to occur on average on only one day in trading days ie of the time theoretically there should be a loss event greater than var two to three times per year the regulatory measure of var is done at a confidence level with a tenday holding period the historical market data applied to calculate the var is updated on a two business day lag refer to market risk regulatory capital below for details of our tenday var metrics for the quarters ended december and respectively including high low average and period end var for interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks as well as total var table start citizens financial group inc table end market risk regulatory capital the us banking regulators market risk rule covers the calculation of market risk capital for the purposes of the market risk rule all of our client facing trades and associated hedges maintain a net low risk and do qualify as covered positions for the three months ended december we were subject to the reporting threshold under the market risk rule which resulted in the inclusion of million of calculated riskweighted assets however for the three months ended december we were not subject to the reporting threshold as a result million of calculated market riskweighted assets as of december was not included in our riskweighted assets and our covered trading activities were riskweighted under us basel iii standardized credit risk rules the internal

historical lookback horizon that is fixed from january this is done not only to identify headline risks from more volatile periods but also to provide a counterbalance to var which may be low during periods of low volatility the holding period for profit and loss determination is ten days in addition to risk management purposes svar is also a component of market risk regulatory capital we calculate svar daily under its own dynamic window regime in a dynamic window regime values of the tenday var are calculated over all possible 260day periods that can be obtained from the complete historical data set refer to market risk regulatory capital above for details of svar metrics including high low average and period end svar for the combined portfolio sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is the measure of exposure to a single risk factor such as a one basis point change in rates or credit spread we conduct and monitor sensitivity on interest rates basis spreads foreign exchange exposures option prices and credit spreads whereas var is based on previous moves in market risk factors over recent periods it may not be an accurate predictor of future market moves sensitivity analysis complements var as it provides an indication of risk relative to each factor irrespective of historical market moves and is an effective tool in evaluating the appropriateness of hedging strategies and concentrations table start citizens financial group inc table end stress testing conducting a stress test of a portfolio consists of running risk models with the inclusion of key variables that simulate various historical or hypothetical scenarios for historical stress tests profit and loss results are simulated for selected time periods corresponding to the most volatile underlying returns while hypothetical stress tests aim to consider concentration risk illiquidity under stressed market conditions and risk arising from our trading activities that may not be fully captured by our other models hypothetical scenarios also assume that market moves happen simultaneously and no repositioning or hedging activity takes place to mitigate losses as market events unfold we generate stress tests of our trading positions on a daily basis for example we currently include a stress test that simulates a lehmantype crisis scenario by taking the worst 20trading day peak to trough moves for the various risk factors that go into var from that period and assumes they occurred simultaneously var model review and validation market risk measurement models used are independently reviewed and subject to ongoing performance analysis by the model owners the independent review and validation focuses on the model methodology market data and performance independent review of market risk measurement models is the responsibility of citizens model risk management and validation team aspects covered include challenging the assumptions used the quantitative techniques employed and the theoretical justification underpinning them and an assessment of the soundness of the required data over time where possible the quantitative impact of the major underlying modeling assumptions will be estimated eg through developing alternative models results of such reviews are shared with our us banking regulators the market risk models may be periodically enhanced due to changes in market price levels and price action regime behavior the market risk management and validation team will conduct internal validation before a new or changed model element is implemented and before a change is made to a market data mapping var backtesting backtesting is one form of validation of the var model and is run daily the market risk rule requires a comparison of our internal var measure to the actual net trading revenue excluding fees commissions reserves intraday trading and net interest income for each day over the preceding year the most recent business days any observed loss in excess of the var number is taken as an exception the level of exceptions determines the multiplication factor used to derive the var and svarbased capital requirement for regulatory reporting purposes when applicable we perform subportfolio backtesting as required under the market risk rule using models approved by our banking regulators for interest rate credit spread
