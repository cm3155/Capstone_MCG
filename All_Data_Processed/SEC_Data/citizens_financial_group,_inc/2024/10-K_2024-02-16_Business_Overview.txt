competition the financial services industry is highly competitive our branch footprint is predominantly in the new england midatlantic and midwest regions though certain lines of business serve national markets within these markets we face competition from community banks superregional and national financial institutions credit unions savings and loan associations mortgage banking firms consumer finance companies securities brokerage firms insurance companies money market funds hedge funds and private equity firms some of our larger competitors may make available to their customers a broader array of products pricing and structure alternatives while some smaller competitors may have more liberal lending policies and processes in addition some of our competitors may not be subject to the same regulatory requirements as we are and therefore may have lower costs they can pass on to customers in the form of more favorable terms competition among providers of financial products and services continues to increase with consumers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives the ability of nonbanking financial institutions including fintech companies to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has also intensified competition in consumer banking the industry has become increasingly dependent on and oriented toward technologydriven delivery systems permitting transactions to be conducted through online and mobile channels in addition technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbank institutions to attract funds and provide lending and other financial products and services the emergence of digitalonly banking models has increased and we expect this trend to continue given their lower cost structure these models are often on average able to offer higher rates on deposit products than retail banking institutions with a traditional branch footprint the primary factors driving competition for loans and deposits are interest rates fees charged tailored value propositions to different customer segments customer service levels convenience including branch locations and hours of operation and the range of products and services offered table start citizens financial group inc table end in commercial banking we face competition in all our client segments

to the normal conduct of business for a further discussion of how regulatory actions may impact our business see item risk factors for additional information regarding regulatory matters see note in item overview we are a bhc under the bank holding company act and have elected to be treated as a fhc under amendments to this act as effected by glba as such we are subject to the supervision

funds transfer act and the real estate settlement procedures act table start citizens financial group inc table end enhanced prudential standards and regulatory tailoring rules as a bhc with over billion in total consolidated assets we are currently subject to enhanced prudential standards and associated capital and liquidity rules tailoring rules the tailoring rules assign each bhc including its bank subsidiaries to one of four categories based on its size and certain riskbased indicators cfg and cbna are each subject to category iv standards the least restrictive of the requirements under the tailoring rules as discussed in greater detail in capital and stress testing requirements and longterm debt requirements the federal banking regulators proposed sweeping changes to the regulatory capital and liquidity rules that would significantly impact the application of those rules to the company bank and financial holding company regulation as a fhc we may engage in a broader range of activities than a bhc that is not also a fhc these activities include securities underwriting and dealing insurance underwriting and brokerage merchant banking and other activities that are determined by the frb in coordination with the treasury department to be financial in nature or incidental thereto or that the frb determines unilaterally to be complementary to financial activities in addition a fhc may commence new permissible financial activities or acquire nonbank financial companies engaged in such activities in either case with afterthefact notice to the frb to maintain fhc status a bhc and all of its depository institution subsidiaries must remain well capitalized and well managed as described below under federal deposit insurance act if a bhc fails to meet these regulatory standards the frb could place limitations on its ability to conduct the broader financial activities permissible for fhcs or impose limitations or conditions on the conduct or activities of the bhc or its affiliates if the deficiencies persisted the frb could order the bhc to divest any subsidiary bank or to cease engaging in any activities permissible for fhcs that are not permissible for bhcs or the bhc could elect to conform its nonbanking activities to those permissible for a bhc that is not also a fhc in addition the cra requires us banks to help serve the needs of their communities if a depository institution subsidiary of a bhc were to receive a cra rating of less than satisfactory the bhc would be prohibited from engaging in certain activities or acquisitions see community reinvestment act below federal and state laws impose notice and approval requirements for mergers and acquisitions of other depository institutions or bhcs as noted above frb approval is generally not required for bhcs to acquire a company engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature as determined by the frb prior regulatory approval is required however before a bhc may acquire or control more than of any class of voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bhc including a fhc or a bank in considering applications for approval of acquisitions the banking regulators may take several factors into account including the competitive effects of the transaction in the relevant geographic markets the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of companies involved in the transaction the effect of the transaction on the financial stability of the us banking or financial system the companies compliance with antimoney laundering laws and regulations the convenience and needs of the communities to be served and the performance record of the idis involved in the transaction under the cra capital and stress testing requirements we are required to comply with the us basel iii rules which establish riskbased and leverage capital requirements the riskbased requirements are based on a banking organizations rwa which is inclusive of the organizations on and offbalance sheet exposures we calculate rwa using the standardized approach and have made the aoci optout election

rules the minimum capital ratios are cet1 capital ratio of tier capital ratio of total capital ratio of and tier leverage ratio of table start citizens financial group inc table end for bhcs with billion or more in assets such as us the frbs capital rules impose an institutionspecific scb on top of each of the three minimum riskbased capital ratios listed above banking institutions that fail to meet the effective minimum ratios including the scb will be subject to constraints on capital distributions including dividends and share repurchases and certain discretionary executive compensation the severity of the constraints depends on the amount of the shortfall and the institutions eligible retained income defined as the greater of four quarter trailing net income net of distributions and tax effects not reflected in net income or the average four quarter trailing net income on january we adopted the cecl accounting standard in reaction to the covid disruption on september the federal banking regulators adopted a final rule relative to regulatory capital treatment of the acl under cecl this rule allowed electing banking organizations to delay the estimated impact of cecl on regulatory capital for a twoyear period ending december followed by a threeyear transition period ending december the threeyear transition period will phasein the reversal of the aggregate amount of the capital benefit provided during the initial twoyear delay as a category iv firm under the tailoring rules we are subject to biennial supervisory stress testing and are exempt from companyrun stress testing and related disclosure requirements the frb supervises category iv firms on an ongoing basis including evaluating the capital adequacy and capital planning processes of firms during offcycle years we are required to develop maintain and submit an annual capital plan for review and approval by our board of directors or one of its committees as well as fr y14 reporting requirements on july the federal banking regulators issued a proposal to implement the basel committee on banking supervisions finalization of the postcrisis bank regulatory capital reforms the proposal commonly referred to as basel iii endgame would significantly revise the capital requirements applicable to large banking organizations with total assets of billion or more including the company under the proposal category iii and iv firms including the company as a category iv firm would become subject to the same capital treatment regarding the inclusion of aoci deductions and rules for minority interest as category i and ii firms the proposal would also replace the existing modelsbased approaches for credit and operational risk which currently apply only to category i and ii firms with two new approaches applicable to category i through iv firms the first would use the existing standardized approach and a proposed revised market risk capital rule the second would use a new expanded riskbased approach consisting of new nonmodelsbased approaches for credit risk operational risk and credit valuation adjustment risk as well as the proposed revised market risk capital rule the approach resulting in the lower ratio would establish the binding ratio for purposes of satisfying regulatory capital requirements and buffers including the scb category iii and iv firms would also be required to calculate counterparty credit exposure relating to derivative transactions using the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk additionally category iv firms would become subject to the supplementary leverage ratio and the countercyclical capital buffer the company estimates a pro forma cet1 ratio adjusted for the aoci optout removal of as of december in addition the proposal is estimated to modestly increase our rwa on a fully phasedin basis under the proposal the rule would take effect on july with a threeyear phasein of the capital impact through

under an acute liquidity stress scenario the nsfr is designed to promote more medium and longterm funding of the assets and activities of banking organizations over a oneyear time horizon under the tailoring rules category iv firms with less than billion in weighted shortterm wholesale funding such as us are not subject to any lcr or nsfr requirement we are subject to certain liquidity

positions monthly establish a set of liquidity risk limits and monitor certain elements of intraday liquidity risk exposures table start citizens financial group inc table end resolution planning category iv firms such as cfg are no longer required to submit resolution plans under section 165d of the doddfrank act however cbna is required to periodically file an idi resolution plan with the fdic this plan enables the fdic as receiver to resolve the institution under applicable receivership provisions of the fdia in a manner that ensures that depositors receive access to their insured deposits within one business day of the institutions failure maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of the institutions assets and minimizes the amount of any loss to the institutions creditors in the fdic issued a statement on resolution plans for idis that among other things established a threeyear filing cycle for banks with billion or more in total assets such as cbna and provided details regarding the content of the resolution plans that filers are required to prepare cbna submitted its most recent resolution plan to the fdic on december on august the fdic issued a proposal that would require idis with total assets of billion or more including cbna to submit a more robust resolution plan biennially that includes a comprehensive strategy from the point of failure to liquidation or return of the institution to the private sector the identified strategy must ensure timely access to insured deposits maximize value from the sale or disposition of assets minimize losses realized by creditors and address potential risks of adverse effects on us economic conditions or financial stability in addition the strategy generally expects but does not require a default scenario whereby the fdic as receiver of the failed institution operates the institution under a bridge bank the proposal also enhances how the credibility of resolution plans will be assessed expands expectations regarding engagement and capabilities testing and requires idis to demonstrate the capability to promptly establish a virtual data room in the runup to or upon failure the proposal provides that idis submit their initial resolution plan no earlier than days from the effective date of the amended rule comments on the proposal were due by november we are in the process of evaluating the impact of the proposal on our business longterm debt requirements on august the federal banking regulators issued a proposal that would require large bank holding companies and idis with total assets of billion or more such as cfg and cbna to maintain a minimum amount of longterm debt the joint agency proposal aims to increase the resolvability and resiliency of large banking organizations by mandating a longterm debt requirement to provide the regulatory agencies additional resources to resolve failed banking organizations foster depositor confidence and decrease costs to the dif in the event of a large banking organization failure under the proposal large bank holding companies and idis would each be required to maintain a minimum amount of eligible longterm debt equal to the greater of percent of rwa percent of average total consolidated assets and percent of total leverage exposure for those banks subject to the supplementary leverage ratio the proposal also prohibits large banking organizations from engaging in certain activities that could complicate their resolution and discourages them from holding longterm debt issued by other banks to reduce interconnectedness the proposal provides for a threeyear transition period with percent of the longterm debt requirement to be met one year after the rule is finalized percent after two years and percent after three years comments on the proposal were due by january we continue to evaluate the full impact of the proposal standards for safety and soundness the fdia requires the federal banking regulators to prescribe operational and managerial standards for all idis including cbna regulations and interagency guidelines adopted by these agencies set forth the safety and soundness standards used to identify and address problems at idis before capital becomes impaired if an agency determines that a bank fails to satisfy any standard it may require the bank to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance consistent with deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans if after being notified to submit a compliance plan an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other types of actions that an undercapitalized institution is subject to under the fdia as discussed in federal deposit insurance act below if an institution fails to comply with such an order the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties table start citizens financial group inc table end federal deposit insurance act the fdia requires among other things that federal banking regulators take prompt corrective action with respect to idis that do not meet minimum capital requirements as described above in capital and stress testing requirements the fdia sets forth the following five capital categories wellcapitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized an idis capital category is determined based on how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors that are established by regulation the federal banking regulators must take certain mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions that are undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized with the actions becoming more restrictive and punitive the lower the institutions capital category under existing rules an idi that is not an advanced approaches institution such as cbna is deemed to be well capitalized if it has a cet1 ratio of at least a tier capital ratio of at least a total capital ratio of at least and a tier leverage ratio of at least the frbs regulations which are applicable to bhcs such as the parent company separately define well capitalizedas having a tier capital ratio of at least and a total capital ratio of at least as described above under bank and financial holding company regulation a fhc that is not well capitalized and well managed or whose bank subsidiaries are not well capitalized and well managed under applicable prompt corrective action standards may be restricted in certain of its activities and ultimately may lose fhc status as of december both the parent company and cbna were wellcapitalized the fdia prohibits insured banks from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in the banks normal market area or nationally depending upon where the deposits are solicited unless it is wellcapitalized or it is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the fdic a bank that is adequately capitalized and accepts brokered deposits under a waiver from the fdic may not pay an interest rate on any deposit in excess of basis points over certain prevailing market rates the fdia imposes no such restrictions on a bank that is wellcapitalized deposit insurance the dif provides insurance coverage for certain deposits up to a standard maximum deposit insurance amount of per depositor based on ownership right and capacity category codes and is funded through assessments on idis based on the risk each institution poses to the dif cbna accepts customer deposits insured by the dif and therefore must pay insurance premiums the fdic may increase cbnas insurance premiums based on various factors including the fdics assessment of its risk profile the fdic also requires large depository institutions including cbna to maintain enhanced deposit account recordkeeping and related information technology system capabilities to facilitate prompt calculation of insured deposits if such an institution was taken into fdic receivership the fdic as required under the fdia established a plan in september to restore the dif reserve ratio as of september to meet or exceed the statutory minimum of within eight years this plan did not include an increase in the deposit insurance assessment rate during the fdic determined that the dif reserve ratio was at risk of not reaching the statutory minimum by the statutory deadline of september absent an increase in assessment rates in october the fdic adopted a final rule to increase initial base deposit insurance assessment rates by basis points beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of this increase in assessment rates was intended to improve the likelihood that the dif reserve ratio will reach the required minimum by the statutory deadline of september in november the fdic approved a final rule to impose special assessments to recover the loss to the dif arising from the protection of uninsured depositors in connection with the systemic risk determination announced on march following the closures of silicon valley bank and signature bank as required by the fdia under the final rule the special assessment is levied on an idis assessment base which is equal to estimated uninsured deposits as reported on the institutions december call report excluding the first billion in estimated uninsured deposits the special assessment is imposed at an annual rate of approximately basis points and will be collected over eight quarterly assessment periods beginning with the first quarter of table start citizens financial group inc table end the fdics current estimate of the loss attributable to this systemic risk determination is billion this estimate will be periodically adjusted as assets are sold liabilities are satisfied and receivership expenses are incurred the fdic would cease collection of special assessments before the end of the initial eightquarter collection period if they expect the loss to be less than expected assessment collections the fdic also reserves the right to impose an extended special assessment collection period after the initial eightquarter period to collect the difference between losses and amounts collected and impose a onetime final shortfall special assessment after both receiverships terminate based on the final rule and related accounting guidance cbnas special assessment is approximately million and was recognized in other operating expense in the companys consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december cbnas special assessment is subject to change if the eventual loss to the dif differs from the fdics current estimate dividends various federal statutory provisions and regulations as well as regulatory expectations limit the amount of dividends
