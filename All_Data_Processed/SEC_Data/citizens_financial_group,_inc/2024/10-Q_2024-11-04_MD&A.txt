role of liquidity management is to ensure that customers have timely access to funds liquidity management also involves maintaining sufficient liquidity to repay wholesale borrowings pay operating expenses and support extraordinary funding requirements when necessary in the ordinary course of business the liquidity of cbna is managed by matching sources and uses of cash the primary sources of bank liquidity include deposits from our consumer and commercial customers payments of principal and interest on loans and investment securities and wholesale borrowings as needed and as described

existing and evolving regulatory liquidity requirements some of which are subject to further rulemaking guidance and interpretation by the applicable federal regulators for further discussion see the liquidity requirements section under regulation and supervision in our form 10k liquidity risk management and governance liquidity risk is measured and managed by the funding and liquidity unit within our treasury group in accordance with policy guidelines promulgated by our board and the asset liability committee the funding and liquidity unit is responsible for maintaining a liquidity management framework that effectively manages liquidity risk processes within this framework include but are not limited to regular and comprehensive reporting including current levels versus threshold limits for a broad set of liquidity metrics and early warning indicators explanatory commentary relating to emerging risk trends and as appropriate recommended remedial strategies liquidity stress testing contingency funding plans and collateral management our funding and liquidity units primary goals are to deliver and maintain prudent levels of operating liquidity to support expected and projected funding requirements contingent liquidity to support unexpected funding requirements resulting from idiosyncratic systemic and combination stress events and regulatory liquidity requirements in a timely manner from stable and costefficient funding sources we seek to accomplish these goals by funding loans with stable deposits by prudently controlling dependence on wholesale funding particularly shortterm unsecured funding and by maintaining ample available liquidity including a contingent liquidity buffer of unencumbered highquality loans and securities we maintain a contingency funding plan designed to ensure that liquidity sources are sufficient to meet ongoing obligations and commitments particularly in a stressed environment or during a market disruption the plan identifies members of the liquidity contingency team and provides a framework for management to follow including notification and escalation of potential liquidity stress events citizens financial

a summary of our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for the nine months ended september and see the consolidated statements of cash flows in item the funding and liquidity unit monitors a variety of liquidity and funding metrics and early warning indicators and metrics including specific risk thresholds limits these monitoring tools are broadly classified as follows current liquidity sources and capacities including cash balances at the frb free and liquid securities and secured borrowing capacity at the fhlb and frb discount window liquidity stress sources including idiosyncratic systemic and combined stresses in addition to evolving regulatory requirements and current and prospective exposures including secured and unsecured wholesale funding and spot and cumulative cashflow gaps across a variety of horizons further certain of these metrics are monitored individually for cbna and for our consolidated enterprise on a daily basis including cash position unencumbered securities asset liquidity and available fhlb borrowing capacity in order to identify emerging trends and risks and inform funding decisions specific metrics are also forecasted over a oneyear horizon offbalance sheet arrangements we engage in a variety of activities that are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets that are generally referred to as offbalance sheet arrangements for more information on these types of activities see note critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements included in this report are prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements an accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements estimates are made using facts and circumstances known at a point in time changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates our significant accounting policies and estimates include the acl fair value measurements and the evaluation and measurement of goodwill impairment for additional information regarding fair value measurements see critical accounting estimates in our form 10k allowance for credit losses the acl of billion at september remained stable compared to december as of september the acl economic forecast over a twoyear reasonable and supportable period was consistent with december with peak unemployment of approximately and starttotrough real gdp decline of approximately these forecasts reflect a mild recession over the twoyear reasonable and supportable period citizens financial group inc our determination of the acl is sensitive to changes in forecasted macroeconomic conditions during the reasonable and supportable forecast period to illustrate the sensitivity we applied a more pessimistic scenario than that described above which reflects deeper real gdp contraction across our twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period with peak unemployment of approximately and starttotrough real gdp decline of approximately excluding consideration of qualitative adjustments this scenario would result in a quantitative lifetime loss estimate of approximately our modeled periodend acl or an increase of approximately million this analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimate and not to the overall periodend acl which includes qualitative adjustments because several quantitative and qualitative factors are considered in determining the acl this sensitivity analysis does not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the acl or even what the acl would be under these economic circumstances the sensitivity analysis is intended to provide insights into the impact of adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment and the corresponding impact to modeled loss estimates the hypothetical determination does not incorporate the impact of management judgment or other qualitative factors that could be applied in the actual estimation of the acl and does not imply any expectation of future deterioration in our loss rates it remains difficult to estimate how changes in economic forecasts might affect our acl because such forecasts consider a wide variety of variables and inputs and changes in the variables and inputs may not occur at the same time or in the same direction and such changes may have differing impacts by product type the variables and inputs may be idiosyncratically affected by risks to the economy including changing monetary and fiscal policies impacts from the recent stress on the banking industry and their impact on inflationary trends changes in one or multiple of the key macroeconomic variables may have a material impact on our estimation of expected credit losses for additional information regarding the acl see note and critical accounting estimates allowance for credit losses and note in our form 10k goodwill we review the goodwill of each reporting unit for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances change that indicate an impairment may exist when assessing goodwill for impairment a qualitative assessment may be made to determine whether it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value the process of evaluating the fair value of a reporting unit is subjective involving management assumptions estimates and forecasts and the use of external or internal valuations future potential changes in assumptions estimates or forecasts may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value additionally a reporting units fair value could change based on market conditions or other factors which could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value for additional information regarding goodwill see critical accounting estimates goodwill

group inc risk governance we are committed to maintaining a strong integrated and proactive approach to the management of all risks to which we are exposed in pursuit of our business objectives a key aspect of our boards responsibility as the main decisionmaking body is setting our risk appetite to ensure that the levels of risk that we are willing to accept in the attainment of our strategic business and financial objectives are clearly understood to enable our board to carry out its objectives it has delegated authority for risk management activities as well as governance and oversight of those activities to a number of board and executive management level risk committees the executive risk committee chaired by the chief risk officer is responsible for oversight of risk across the enterprise and actively considers our inherent material risks analyzes our overall risk profile and seeks confirmation that the risks are being appropriately identified assessed and mitigated

presents the sensitivity of net interest income to various parallel yield curve shifts from the market implied forward yield curve our policies involve measuring exposures as a percentage change in net interest income over the next year due to either instantaneous or gradual parallel changes in rates relative to the market implied forward yield curve as the following table illustrates our balance sheet is asset sensitive net interest income would benefit from an increase in interest rates while exposure to a decline in interest rates is within limits established and monitored by senior management while an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates is included in this analysis we believe that any actual shift in interest rates would be more gradual and therefore have a more modest impact table sensitivity of net interest income estimated change in net interest income over months basis points september december instantaneous change in interest rates gradual change in

net interest income assumes the forwardrate path implied by the periodend yield curve is realized the rate risk exposure is then measured based on assumed changes from that base case rate path our risk position is slightly asset sensitive to a gradual change in rates as of september compared to our broadly neutral position as of december our interest rate sensitivity incorporates the impacts of changes in our balance sheet mix including securities loans deposits borrowed funds and hedge activity which is primarily comprised of received fixed swaps that offset our naturally assetsensitive balance sheet we use a valuation measure of exposure to structural interest rate risk eve as a supplement to net interest income simulations eve complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure over a longterm horizon eve measures the extent to which the economic value of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates this analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with noncontractual maturities we employ sophisticated models for prepayments and deposit pricing and attrition which provide a granular view of cash flows based on the unique characteristics of the underlying products and customer segments the change in value is expressed as a percentage of
