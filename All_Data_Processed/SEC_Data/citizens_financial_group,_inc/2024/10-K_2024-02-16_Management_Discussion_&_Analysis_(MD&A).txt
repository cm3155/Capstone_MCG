portfolios using applicable regulatory capital methodologies the assessment also considers the possible impacts of approved and proposed changes to regulatory capital requirements key analytical frameworks including scenario analysis and stress testing supplement our base line forecast to help inform a range of potential outcomes a governance framework supports our capital planning process including capital management policies and procedures that document capital adequacy metrics and limits as well as our capital contingency plan and the active engagement of both the board and senior

both us and our banking subsidiary we prepare this plan in accordance with the capital plan rule and we participate annually in the frbs horizontal capital review as part of their normal supervisory process which includes an assessment of specific capital planning areas the frb regularly supervises and evaluates our capital adequacy and capital planning processes including the submission of an annual capital plan approved by our board of directors or one of its committees under the frbs capital requirements we must maintain capital ratios above the sum of the regulatory minimum and scb

subject to further rulemaking guidance and interpretation by the applicable federal regulators for further discussion see the liquidity requirements section under regulation and supervision in item liquidity risk management and governance liquidity risk is measured and managed by the funding and liquidity unit within our treasury group in accordance with policy guidelines promulgated by our board and the asset liability committee the funding and liquidity unit is responsible for maintaining a liquidity management framework that effectively manages liquidity risk processes within this framework include but are not limited to regular and comprehensive reporting including current levels versus threshold limits for a broad set of liquidity metrics and early warning indicators explanatory commentary relating to emerging risk trends and as appropriate recommended remedial strategies liquidity stress testing contingency funding plans and collateral management our funding and liquidity units primary goals are to deliver and maintain prudent levels of operating liquidity to support expected and projected funding requirements contingent liquidity to support unexpected funding requirements resulting from idiosyncratic systemic and combination stress events and regulatory liquidity requirements in a timely manner from stable and costefficient funding sources we seek to accomplish these goals by funding loans with stable deposits by prudently controlling dependence on wholesale funding particularly shortterm unsecured funding and by maintaining ample available liquidity including a contingent liquidity buffer of unencumbered highquality loans and securities table start citizens financial group inc table end we maintain a contingency funding plan designed to ensure that liquidity sources are sufficient to meet ongoing obligations and commitments particularly in a stressed environment or during a market disruption the plan identifies members of the liquidity contingency team and provides a framework for management to follow including notification and escalation of potential liquidity stress events in response to the recent us bank failures the frb established the bank term funding program to make additional funding available to eligible depository institutions to ensure the ability to meet the needs of all depositors this program was designed to provide another source of liquidity against the par value of highquality securities eliminating the need to sell these securities during times of stress the company is eligible to borrow under this program which expires in march based on its existing eligibility for primary credit under the frb discount window the company has taken steps to support readiness but has not participated

retail loans for a summary of our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for the years ended december and see the consolidated statements of cash flows in item the funding and liquidity unit monitors a variety of liquidity and funding metrics and early warning indicators and metrics including specific risk thresholds limits these monitoring tools are broadly classified as follows current liquidity sources and capacities including cash balances at the frb free and liquid securities and secured borrowing capacity at the fhlb and frb discount window liquidity stress sources including idiosyncratic systemic and combined stresses in addition to evolving regulatory requirements and current and prospective exposures including secured and unsecured wholesale funding and spot and cumulative cashflow gaps across a variety of horizons further certain of these metrics are monitored individually for cbna and for our consolidated enterprise on a daily basis including cash position unencumbered securities asset liquidity and available fhlb borrowing capacity in order to identify emerging trends and risks and inform funding decisions specific metrics are also forecasted over a

that are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets that are generally referred to as offbalance sheet arrangements for more information on these types of activities see note table start citizens financial group inc table end critical accounting estimates our audited consolidated financial statements included in this report are prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our audited consolidated financial statements an accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on our audited consolidated financial statements estimates are made using facts and circumstances known at a point in time changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates our most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed below see note for further discussion of our significant accounting policies allowance for credit losses the acl increased from billion at december to billion at december our acl as of december accounts for an economic forecast over our twoyear reasonable and supportable period with peak unemployment of approximately and peaktotrough gdp decline of approximately this forecast reflects a mild recession over the twoyear reasonable and supportable period this compares to our december forecast which reflected peak unemployment of approximately with a more adverse peaktotrough gdp decline of approximately our determination of the acl is sensitive to changes in forecasted macroeconomic conditions during the reasonable and supportable forecast period to illustrate the sensitivity we applied a more pessimistic scenario than that described above which reflects deeper real gdp contraction across our twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period resulting in a peaktotrough decline in real gdp excluding consideration of qualitative adjustments this scenario would result in a quantitative lifetime loss estimate of approximately our modeled periodend acl or an increase of approximately million this analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimate and not to the overall periodend acl which includes qualitative adjustments because several quantitative and qualitative factors are considered in determining the acl this sensitivity analysis does not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the acl or even what the acl would be under these economic circumstances the sensitivity is intended to provide insights into the impact of adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment and the corresponding impact to modeled loss estimates the hypothetical determination does not incorporate the impact of management judgment or other qualitative factors that could be applied in the actual estimation of the acl and does not imply any expectation of future deterioration in our loss rates it remains difficult to estimate how changes in economic forecasts might affect our acl because such forecasts consider a wide variety of variables and inputs and changes in the variables and inputs may not occur at the same time or in the same direction and such changes may have differing impacts by product type the variables and inputs may be idiosyncratically affected by risks to the economy including changing monetary and fiscal policies impacts from the recent stress on the banking industry and their impact on inflationary trends changes in one or multiple of the key macroeconomic variables may have a material impact to our estimation of expected credit losses for additional information regarding the acl see note goodwill the acquisition method of accounting requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations are recorded at their fair values business combinations typically result in goodwill which is subject to ongoing periodic impairment tests based on the fair values of the reporting units to which the goodwill has been attributed we review the goodwill of each reporting unit for impairment on an annual basis as of october st or more frequently if events or circumstances change that indicate an impairment may exist when assessing goodwill for impairment a qualitative assessment may be made to determine whether it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value alternatively a quantitative assessment may be performed without performing a qualitative assessment at december goodwill totaled billion including billion from preipo acquisitions and is assigned to our reporting units as follows billion to commercial banking including billion from preipo acquisitions and billion to consumer banking including billion from preipo acquisitions table start citizens financial group inc table end the process of evaluating the fair value of a reporting unit is subjective involving management assumptions and estimates and the use of external or internal valuations valuation techniques include discounted cash flow and market approach analysis in the fourth quarter of the quantitative impairment test estimated the fair value of the reporting units using an equal weighting of an income approach ie discounted cash flows method and marketbased approach ie the guideline public company method the guideline public company method utilizes comparable public company information and key valuation multiples and considers a market control premium associated with cost synergies and other cash flow benefits that arise from obtaining control over a reporting unit and guideline transactions when applicable under the income approach cash flow projections are based on multiyear financial forecasts developed for each reporting unit that consider key business drivers such as new business initiatives customer retention standards market share changes anticipated loan and deposit growth fees and expenses forward interest rates historical performance credit performance and industry and economic trends among other considerations the projection of net interest income and noninterest expense are the most significant inputs to the financial projections of the commercial banking and consumer banking reporting units the longterm earnings growth rate used in determining the terminal value of each reporting unit was as of october based on managements assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of each reporting unit discount rates are estimated based on the capital asset pricing model which considers the riskfree interest rate market risk premium beta and unsystematic risk adjustments specific to a particular reporting unit the discount rates are also calibrated based on risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit a discount rate of was utilized for the commercial banking and consumer banking reporting units as of october we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of as part of our annual impairment assessment based on this quantitative assessment we concluded that the estimated fair value of the consumer banking and commercial banking reporting units exceeded their carrying value the commercial banking reporting units fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately circumstances that could negatively impact the future fair value of the commercial banking reporting unit include a sustained decrease in our stock price decline in industry peer multiples deterioration in the reporting units forecasts and an increase in the discount rate driven by an increase in the riskfree rate or the risk we may not achieve our forecasted cash flows we monitored events and circumstances during the period from october through december including macroeconomic and market factors industry and banking sector events companyspecific performance indicators a comparison of managements forecast and assumptions to those used in its october quantitative impairment test and the sensitivity of the october quantitative test results to changes in assumptions through december based on these considerations management concluded that it was not morelikelythannot that the fair value of either of its reporting units is below its respective carrying amount as of december for additional information regarding goodwill see note fair value we asses the fair value of assets and liabilities by applying various valuation methodologies which may involve a significant degree of judgment particularly when active markets do not exist for the items being valued quoted market prices are used to estimate the fair value of certain assets such as trading assets investment securities and residential real estate loans held for sale assumptions are used to estimate the fair value of items for which an observable active market does not exist and include discount rates rates of return on assets repayment rates cash flows default rates costs of servicing and liquidation values the use of different assumptions could produce significantly different fair value estimates which could have a material impact on our results of operations financial condition or fair value disclosures we also assess whether there are any declines in fair value below the carrying value of assets that require recognition of a loss in the consolidated statements of operations including certain investments capitalized servicing assets goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets for additional information regarding our fair value measurements see note table start citizens financial

committee executive risk committee and the board risk committee for approval as appropriate key management processes we employ a comprehensive and integrated risk control program to proactively identify measure monitor and mitigate existing and emerging credit risks across the credit life cycle including origination accountportfolio management and loss mitigation and recovery consumer on the consumer banking side of credit risk our teams use models to evaluate consumer loans across the life cycle of the loan credit scoring models are used to forecast the probability of default of an applicant at origination when approving customers for a new loan or extension of an existing credit line credit scores are used in conjunction with other credit risk variables such as affordability length of term collateral value collateral type and lien subordination table start citizens financial group inc table end lending authority is granted by the second line of defense credit risk function to each underwriter to ensure proper oversight of the underwriting teams the amount of delegated authority depends on the experience of the individual we periodically evaluate the performance of each underwriter and annually reauthorize their delegated authority only senior members of the second line of defense credit risk team are authorized to approve significant exceptions to credit policies it is not uncommon to make exceptions to established policies when compensating factors are present there are exception limits which when reached trigger a comprehensive analysis credit scores and collateral values are refreshed at regular intervals once an account is established to allow for proactive identification of increasing or decreasing levels of credit risk our approach to managing credit risk is highly analytical and where appropriate is automated to ensure consistency and efficiency commercial on the commercial banking side of credit risk risk management begins with defined credit products and policies and is separated into commercial and industrial loans cre and leases within commercial and industrial loans and leases there are separate verticals established for certain specialty products eg assetbased lending leasing franchise finance health care technology and midcorporate a specialty vertical is a standalone team of industry or product specialists substantially all activity that falls under the ambit of the defined industry or product is managed through a specialty vertical when one exists cre also operates as a specialty vertical commercial transactions are subject to individual analysis and approval at origination and with few exceptions are subject to a formal annual review requirement the underwriting process includes the establishment and approval of credit grades that establish the pd and lgd all material transactions require the approval of both a business line approver and an independent credit approver with the requisite level of delegated authority the approval level of a particular credit facility is determined by the size of the credit relationship as well as the pd the checks and balances in the credit process and the independence of the credit approver function are designed to appropriately assess and sanction the level of credit risk being accepted facilitate the early recognition of credit problems when they occur and to provide for effective problem asset management and resolution all authority to grant credit is delegated through the independent credit risk function and is closely monitored and updated annually at a minimum the primary factors considered in commercial credit approvals are the financial strength of the borrower assessment of the borrowers management capabilities cash flows from operations industry sector trends type and sufficiency of collateral type of exposure transaction structure and the general economic outlook while these are the primary factors considered there are a number of other factors that may be considered in the decision process in addition to the credit analysis conducted during the approval process at origination and annual review our credit review group performs testing to provide an independent review and assessment of the quality of the portfolio and new originations this group conducts portfolio reviews on a riskbased cycle to evaluate individual loans and validate risk ratings as well as test the consistency of the credit processes and the effectiveness of credit risk management the maximum level of credit exposure to individual credit borrowers is limited by policy guidelines based on the perceived risk of each borrower or related group of borrowers concentration risk is managed through limits on industry asset class and loan quality factors we focus predominantly on extending credit to commercial customers with existing or expandable relationships within our primary markets although we do engage in lending opportunities outside our primary markets if we believe that the associated risks are acceptable and aligned with strategic initiatives substantially all loans categorized as classified are managed by a specialized group of credit professionals market risk market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices commodity prices andor other relevant market rates or prices modest market risk arises from trading activities that serve customer needs including the hedging of interest rate and foreign exchange risk as described below the market risk arising from our nontrading banking activities such as the origination of loans and depositgathering is more significant we have established enterprisewide policies and methodologies to identify measure monitor and report market risk we actively manage market risk for both nontrading and trading activities table start citizens financial group inc table end nontrading risk our nontrading banking activities expose us to market risk this market risk is composed of interest rate risk as we have no commodity risk and de minimis direct currency and equity risk we also have market risk related to capital markets loan originations as well as the valuation of our msrs interest rate risk interest rate risk emerges from the balance sheet after the aggregation of our assets liabilities and equity we refer to this nontrading risk embedded in the balance sheet as structural interest rate risk or interest rate risk in the banking book a major source of structural interest rate risk is a difference in the repricing of assets relative to liabilities and equity there are differences in the timing and drivers of rate changes reflecting the maturity andor repricing of assets and liabilities for example the rate earned on a commercial loan may reprice monthly with changes in the benchmark rate while the rate paid on debt or certificates of deposit may be fixed for a longer period there may also be differences in the drivers of rate changes loans may be tied to a specific index rate such as sofr or prime while deposits may not be as correlated with such rates and more dependent upon competitive demand due to these basis differences net interest income is sensitive to changes in spreads between certain indices or repricing rates a primary source of our structural interest rate risk relates to faster repricing of floatingrate loans relative to core deposit funding this source of asset sensitivity is more biased toward the short end of the yield curve the secondary source of our interest rate risk is driven by longer term rates comprising the rollover or reinvestment risk on fixedrate loans as well as prepayment risk on mortgagerelated loans and securities funded by nonrate sensitive deposits and equity another important source of structural interest rate risk relates to the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options for example most consumer loans can be prepaid without penalty and most consumer deposits can be withdrawn without penalty the exercise of such options by customers can exacerbate the timing differences discussed above the primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk within policy limits approved by our board these limits and guidelines reflect our tolerance for interest rate risk over both shortterm and longterm horizons to ensure that exposure to interest rate risk is managed within our risk appetite we measure the exposure and hedge it as necessary the treasury asset and liability management team is responsible for measuring monitoring and reporting on our structural interest rate risk position these exposures are reported on a monthly basis to the asset liability committee and at board meetings we measure structural interest rate risk through a variety of metrics intended to quantify both shortterm and longterm exposures the primary method we use to quantify interest rate risk is simulation analysis in which we model net interest income from assets liabilities and hedge derivative positions under various interest rate scenarios over a threeyear horizon exposure to interest rate risk is reflected in the variation of forecasted net interest income across these scenarios key assumptions in this simulation analysis relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads changes in product balances and the behavior of our loan and deposit customers in different rate environments repricing characteristics and balance fluctuations of deposits with indeterminate ie noncontractual maturities as well as the pace of mortgage prepayments are the most significant behavioral assumptions we utilize product level models that consider specific product characteristics and composition of the deposit portfolio along with current and forwardlooking market dynamics to project deposit rates similarly we employ dynamic prepayment and mortgage rate models to project prepayment behaviors specific to each of our product offerings these models are developed based on internal performance data over prior interest rate cycles and calibrated to our experience and outlook for rates across a diverse set of market environments we assess our models and assumptions periodically by running sensitivity analyses to determine the impact of changes to inputs or assumptions on our risk results which are reported to the asset liability committee table start citizens financial group inc table end since we cannot predict the future path of interest rates we use simulation analysis to project net interest income under various interest rate scenarios including a most likely implied forward scenario as well as a variety of extreme and unlikely scenarios these scenarios may assume gradual ramping of the overall level of interest rates immediate shocks to the level of rates and various yield curve twists in which movements in short or longterm rates predominate generally projected net interest income in any interest rate scenario is compared to net interest income in a base case where marketforward rates are realized the table below reports net interest income exposures against a variety of interest rate scenarios our policies involve measuring exposures as a percentage change in net interest income over the next year due to either instantaneous or gradual parallel changes in rates relative to the market implied forward yield curve as the following table illustrates our balance sheet is marginally assetsensitive net interest income would benefit from an increase in interest rates while exposure to a decline in interest rates is within limits established and monitored by senior management while an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates is included in this analysis we believe that any actual shift in interest rates would be more gradual and therefore have a more modest impact the table below presents the sensitivity of net interest income to various parallel yield curve shifts from the market implied forward yield curve table start table sensitivity of net interest income estimated change in net interest income over months december basis points instantaneous change in interest rates gradual change in interest rates table end we continue to manage asset sensitivity within the scope of our policy changing market conditions and changes in our balance sheet the companys base case net interest income assumes the forwardrate path implied by the yield curve is realized which reflects a fed funds rate of at the end of reflecting five basis point reductions beginning in the second quarter of the rate risk exposure is then measured based on assumed changes from that base case rate path as of december our asset sensitivity has shifted to a more neutral position compared to this reflects the impacts of changes in our balance sheet mix including securities loans deposits borrowed funds and ongoing hedge activity which is primarily comprised of received fixed swaps that offset our naturally assetsensitive balance sheet our sensitivity profile exhibits asymmetry for up and down rate scenarios as we expect to see incremental deposit migration to higher rate products in response to rising rate scenarios compared to declining rate scenario we use a valuation measure of exposure to structural interest rate risk eve as a supplement to net interest income simulations eve complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure over a longterm horizon eve measures the extent to which the economic value of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates this analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with noncontractual maturities we employ sophisticated models for prepayments and deposit pricing and attrition which provide a granular view of cash flows based on the unique characteristics of the underlying products and customer segments the change in value is expressed as a percentage of regulatory capital table start citizens financial group

shortterm price differences market risk governance the process of setting our market risk limit is established in accordance with the formal enterprise risk appetite process and policy which reflects the strategic and enterprise level articulation of opportunities for creating franchise value set to the boundaries of how much market risk to assume dealing authorities represent the key control tool in the management of market risk that allows the cascading of the risk appetite throughout the enterprise a dealing authority sets the operational scope and tolerances within which a business andor trading desk is permitted to operate which is reviewed annually at a minimum dealing authorities are structured to accommodate client facing trades and hedges needed to manage the risk profile with responsibility for remaining within established tolerances residing with the business key risk indicators including var open foreign currency positions and single name risk are monitored daily and reported against tolerances consistent with our risk appetite and business strategy to the appropriate business line management and risk counterparts market risk measurement we use var as a statistical measure for estimating potential exposure of our traded market risk in normal market conditions our var framework for risk management and regulatory reporting is the same risk management var is based on a oneday holding period to a confidence level and regulatory var is based on a tenday holding period to the same confidence level in addition to var nonstatistical measurements for measuring risk such as sensitivity analysis market value and stress testing are employed table start citizens financial group inc table end our market risk platform and associated market risk and valuation models capture correlation effects across all our covered positions and allow for aggregation of market risk across products risk types business lines and legal entities we measure monitor and report market risk for management and regulatory capital purposes var overview the market risk measurement model is based on historical simulation the var measure estimates the extent of any fair value losses on trading positions that may occur due to broad market movements general var such as changes in the level of interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices it is calculated on the basis that current positions remain relatively unaltered over the course of a given holding period with the assumption that markets are sufficiently liquid to allow the business to close its positions if required within this holding period based on the composition of our covered positions we also use a standardized addon approach for the loan trading and high yield bond desks specific risk capital which estimates the extent of any losses that may occur from factors other than broad market movements the general var approach is expressed in terms of a confidence level over the past trading days the internal var measure used as the basis of the main var trading limits is a confidence level with a oneday holding period indicating that a loss greater than the var is expected to occur on average on only one day in trading days ie of the time theoretically there should be a loss event greater than var two to three times per year the regulatory measure of var is a confidence level with a tenday holding period the historical market data applied to calculate the var is updated on a twobusiness day lag refer to market risk regulatory capital below for details of our tenday var metrics for the quarters ended december and market risk regulatory capital the us banking regulators market risk rule covers the calculation of market risk capital under this rule all of our client facing trades and associated hedges maintain a net low risk and qualify as covered positions the internal management var measure is calculated based on the same population of trades that is utilized for regulatory var table start table results of modeled and nonmodeled measures for regulatory capital calculations dollars in millions for the three months ended december for the three

capital market riskweighted assets table end table start citizens financial group inc table end stressed var svar is an extension of var and utilizes a longer historical lookback horizon fixed from january to identify headline risks from more volatile periods and to provide a counterbalance to var which may be low during periods of low volatility the holding period for profit and loss determination is ten days in addition to its utilization for risk management purposes svar is a component of market risk regulatory capital we calculate svar daily under its own dynamic window regime whereby values of the tenday var are calculated over all 260day periods that can be obtained from the complete historical data set refer to market risk regulatory capital above for svar metrics sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is the measure of exposure to a single risk factor such as a one basis point change in rates or credit spread we conduct and monitor sensitivity on interest rates basis spreads foreign exchange exposures option prices and credit spreads since var is based on previous moves in market risk factors over recent periods it may not be an accurate predictor of future market moves sensitivity analysis complements var as it provides an indication of risk relative to each factor irrespective of historical market moves and is an effective tool in evaluating the appropriateness of hedging strategies and concentrations stress testing conducting a stress test of a portfolio consists of running risk models with the inclusion of key variables that simulate various historical or hypothetical scenarios for historical stress tests profit and loss results are simulated for select time periods corresponding to the most volatile underlying returns while hypothetical stress tests aim to consider concentration risk illiquidity under stressed market conditions and risk arising from our trading activities that may not be fully captured by our other riskmeasurement methodologies hypothetical scenarios also assume that market moves occur simultaneously and no repositioning or hedging activity takes place to mitigate losses as market events unfold stress tests of our trading positions are generated daily var model review and validation our market risk measurement models are independently reviewed and subject to ongoing performance analysis by the model owners this independent review and validation focuses on model methodology market data and performance and is the responsibility of citizens model risk management and validation team this team challenges the assumptions used and quantitative techniques employed including the theoretical justification supporting them and performs an assessment of the soundness of the required data over time the quantitative impact of the major underlying modeling assumptions is estimated eg through developing alternative models if possible the market risk models may be periodically enhanced due to changes in market price levels and price action regime behavior the market risk management and validation team conducts internal validation before a new or changed model element is implemented and before a change is made to market data mapping var backtesting backtesting is one form of validation of the var model and is run daily the market risk rule requires a comparison of our internal var measure to the actual net trading revenue excluding fees commissions reserves intraday trading and net interest income for each day over the preceding year the most recent business days any observed loss in excess of the var number is taken as an exception the level of exceptions determines the multiplication factor used to derive the var and svarbased capital requirement for regulatory reporting purposes when applicable we perform subportfolio backtesting as required under the market risk rule using models approved by our banking regulators for interest rate credit spread and foreign exchange
