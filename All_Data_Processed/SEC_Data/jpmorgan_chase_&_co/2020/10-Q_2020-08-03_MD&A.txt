of reportable hqla as a result of increased cash from unsecured longterm debt issuances the firms average lcr fluctuates from period to period due to changes in its hqla and estimated net cash outflows as a result of ongoing business activity other liquidity sources in addition to the assets reported in the firms hqla above the firm had unencumbered marketable securities such as equity securities and fixed income debt securities that the firm believes would be available to raise liquidity this includes securities included as part of the excess hqla at jpmorgan chase bank na that are not transferable to non bank affiliates as described above the fair value of these securities was approximately billion and billion as of june and december respectively although the amount of liquidity that could be raised would be dependent on prevailing market conditions the fair value increased compared to december due to an increase in excess hqla at jpmorgan chase bank na which was primarily a result of increased deposits as noted above the firm also had available borrowing capacity at fhlbs and the discount window at the federal reserve bank as a result of collateral pledged by the firm to such banks of approximately billion and billion as of june and december respectively this borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of cash and securities reported in the firms hqla or other unencumbered securities that are currently pledged at the federal reserve bank discount window and other central banks available borrowing capacity decreased from december primarily due to lower credit card receivable balances and lower collateral values due to a decline in their fair value both driven by the covid19 pandemic although available the firm does not view this borrowing capacity at the federal reserve bank discount window and the other central banks as a primary source of liquidity funding sources of funds management believes that the firms unsecured and secured funding

result of market conditions in the wholesale businesses the inflows principally occurred in march and in general were maintained through the second quarter in ccb the increase was driven by the

payments refer to the discussion of the firms business segment results and the consolidated balance sheets analysis on pages and pages respectively for further information on deposit and liability balance trends deposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce the firms reliance on the wholesale funding markets a significant portion of the firms deposits are consumer deposits and

firm uses lendingrelated financial instruments such as commitments including revolving credit facilities and guarantees to address the financing needs of its clients the contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent the maximum possible credit risk should the clients draw down on these commitments or when the firm fulfills its obligations under these guarantees and the clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of these contracts most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been refinanced extended cancelled or expired without being drawn upon or a default occurring as a result the firm does not believe that the total contractual amount of these wholesale lendingrelated commitments is representative of the firms expected future credit

levels on an ongoing basis and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other collateral or to reduce positions when appropriate these receivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the firms consolidated balance sheets derivative contracts derivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage risks including credit risk and risks arising from

refer to note and note for a description of the policies methodologies and judgments used to determine the firms allowances for credit losses on loans lending related commitments and investment securities the allowance for credit losses increased compared with december primarily reflecting the deterioration and uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment as a result of the impact of the covid19 pandemic consisting of a billion addition in consumer predominantly in the credit card and residential real estate portfolios a net billion addition in wholesale across the lobs impacting multiple industry sectors and a net billion addition as a result of the adoption of cecl the increase in the allowance for loan losses and lending related commitments was primarily driven by an increase in the provision for credit losses reflecting the deterioration in and uncertainty around the future macroeconomic environment as a result of the impact of the covid19 pandemic in the first quarter of managements macroeconomic forecast included a decline in the us real gdp of approximately and an increase in the us unemployment rate to above both in the second quarter followed by a solid recovery in the second half of in the second quarter of based on the increased uncertainty around the duration and depth of the downturn and speed of economic recovery the firms central case reflected a more protracted downturn with a slower recovery of us real gdp the adoption of the cecl accounting guidance resulted in a change in the accounting for pci loans which are considered pcd loans under

portfolio is predominantly held by treasury and cio in connection with the firms balance sheet or assetliability management objectives principal investments are predominantly privatelyheld financial instruments and are managed in the lobs and corporate investments are typically intended to be held over extended periods and accordingly the firm has no expectation for shortterm realized gains with respect to these investments investment securities risk investment securities risk includes the exposure associated with a default in the payment of principal and interest this risk is mitigated given that the investment securities portfolio held by treasury and cio is predominantly invested in highquality securities at june the treasury and cio investment securities portfolio net of allowance for

market risk management is actively monitoring the impact of the covid19 pandemic on market risk exposures by leveraging existing risk measures and controls models used to measure market risk are inherently imprecise and may be limited in their ability to measure certain risks or to predict losses this imprecision may be heightened when sudden or severe shifts in market conditions occur such as those observed during the covid19 pandemic for additional discussion on model uncertainty refer to estimations and model risk management on page market risk management periodically reviews the firms existing market risk measures to identify opportunities for enhancement and to the extent appropriate will calibrate those measures accordingly over time this is increasingly important in periods of sustained heightened market volatility valueatrisk jpmorgan chase utilizes valueatrisk var a statistical risk measure to estimate the potential loss from adverse market moves in the current market environment the firm has a single var framework used as a basis for calculating risk management var and regulatory var the firms risk management var is calculated assuming a oneday holding period and an expected tailloss methodology which approximates a confidence level for risk management purposes the firm believes this methodology provides a daily measure of risk that is closely aligned to risk management decisions made by the lobs and corporate and along with other market risk measures provides the appropriate information needed to respond to risk events the firm calculates separately a daily aggregated var in accordance with regulatory rules regulatory var which is used to derive the firms regulatory varbased capital requirements under basel iii the firms var model calculations are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the firms portfolios changes in market conditions improvements in the firms modeling techniques and

driven by the substantial increase in volatility in the oneyear historical lookback period as a result of the covid19 pandemic the most significant impacts were reflected in the fixed income and commodities risk types effective january the firm refined the scope of var to exclude positions related to the risk management of interest rate exposure from changes in the firms own credit spread on

earningsatrisk the effect of interest rate exposure on the firms reported net income is important as interest rate risk represents one of the firms significant market risks interest rate risk arises not only from trading activities but also from the firms traditional banking activities which include extension of loans and credit facilities taking deposits and issuing debt as well as from the investment securities portfolio refer to the table on page of jpmorgan chases form 10k for a summary by lob and corporate identifying positions included in earningsatrisk one way the firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk is through earningsatrisk earningsatrisk estimates the firms interest rate exposure for a given interest rate scenario it is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline which includes net interest income and certain interest rate sensitive fees the baseline uses market interest rates and in the case of deposits pricing assumptions the firm conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest ratesensitive assets and liabilities denominated in us dollars and other currencies nonus dollar currencies these simulations primarily include retained loans deposits deposits with banks investment securities long term debt and any related interest rate hedges and exclude other positions in risk management var and other sensitivitybased measures as described on page of jpmorgan chases form 10k earningsatrisk scenarios estimate the potential change to a net interest income baseline over the following months utilizing multiple assumptions these scenarios include a parallel shift involving changes to both shortterm and longterm rates by an equal amount a steeper yield curve involving holding shortterm rates constant and increasing longterm rates and a flatter yield curve involving increasing shortterm rates and holding longterm rates constant these scenarios consider many different factors including the impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous changes in interest rates from baseline rates forecasted balance sheet as well as modeled prepayment and reinvestment behavior but do not include assumptions about actions that could be taken by the firm in response to any such instantaneous rate changes mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates the time since origination and other factors which are updated periodically based on historical experience the pricing sensitivity of deposits using normalized deposit betas which represent the amount by which deposit rates paid could change upon a given change in market interest rates over the cycle the deposit rates paid in these scenarios may differ from actual deposit rates paid particularly for retail deposits due to repricing lags and other factors the firms earningsatrisk scenarios are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the firms balance sheet changes in market conditions improvements in the firms simulation and other factors while a relevant measure of the firms interest rate exposure the earnings at risk analysis does not represent

december reflected updates to the firms baseline for lower shortterm and longterm rates as well as the impact of changes in the firms balance sheet the firms sensitivity to rates is primarily a result of assets repricing at a faster pace than deposits based upon current and implied market rates as of june scenarios reflecting lower rates could result in negative interest rates the us has never experienced an interest rate environment where the federal reserve has a negative interest rate policy in a negative rate environment the modeling assumptions used for certain assets and liabilities

estimations and model risk a subcategory of operational risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused estimation outputs the firm uses models and other analytical and judgment based estimations across various businesses and functions the estimation methods are of varying levels of sophistication and are used for many purposes such as the valuation of positions measurement of risk sizing the allowance for credit losses assessing regulatory capital requirements conducting stress testing and making business decisions while models are inherently imprecise the degree of imprecision or uncertainty can be heightened by the market or economic environment this is particularly true when the current and forecasted environment is significantly different from the historical macroeconomic environments upon which the models were calibrated as the firm has experienced during the covid19 pandemic this uncertainty may necessitate a greater degree of judgment and analytics to inform adjustments to model outputs than in typical periods refer to critical accounting estimates used by the firm on pages and note of this form 10q and estimations and model risk management section on page of jpmorgan chases form 10k for a summary of modelbased valuations and other valuation techniques critical accounting estimates used by the firm jpmorgan chases accounting policies and use of estimates are integral to understanding its reported results the firms most complex accounting estimates require managements judgment to ascertain the appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities the firm has established policies and control procedures intended to ensure that estimation methods including any judgments made as part of such methods are wellcontrolled independently reviewed and applied consistently from period to period the methods used and judgments made reflect among other factors the nature of the assets or liabilities and the related business and risk management strategies which may vary across the firms businesses and portfolios in addition the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner the firm believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of its assets and liabilities are appropriate the following is a brief description of the firms critical accounting estimates involving significant judgments allowance for credit losses the firms allowance for credit losses represents managements estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the firms financial assets measured at amortized cost certain offbalance sheet lendingrelated commitments and investment securities the allowance for credit losses comprises the allowance for loan losses which covers the firms retained loan portfolios scored and riskrated the allowance for lendingrelated commitments and the allowance for credit losses on investment securities which covers the firms htm and afs securities the allowance for credit losses involves significant judgment on a number of matters including development and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts incorporation of historical loss experience assessment of risk characteristics assignment of risk ratings valuation of collateral and the determination of remaining expected life refer to note and note for further information on these judgments as well as the firms policies and methodologies used to determine the firms allowance for credit losses one of the most significant judgments involved in estimating the firms allowance for credit losses relates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses over the eightquarter forecast period within the firms methodology the eightquarter forecast incorporates hundreds of macroeconomic variables mevs that are relevant for exposures across the firm with modeled credit losses being driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty variables the specific variables that have the greatest effect on the modeled losses of each portfolio vary by portfolio and geography key mevs for the consumer portfolio include us unemployment house price index hpi and us real gross domestic product gdp key mevs for the wholesale portfolio include us real gdp us unemployment us equity prices corporate credit spreads oil prices commercial real estate prices and hpi changes in the firms assumptions and forecasts of economic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one reporting period to the next the covid19 pandemic has resulted in a weak labor market and weak overall economic conditions that will continue to affect borrowers across the firms consumer and wholesale lending portfolios significant judgment is required to estimate the severity and duration of the current economic downturn as well as its potential impact on borrower defaults and loss severities in particular macroeconomic conditions and forecasts regarding the duration and severity of the economic downturn caused by the covid19 pandemic have been rapidly changing and remain highly uncertain it is difficult to predict exactly how borrower behavior will be impacted by these changes in economic conditions the effectiveness of government support customer assistance and enhanced unemployment benefits should act as mitigants to credit losses but the extent of the mitigation impact remains uncertain it is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit losses because management considers a wide variety of factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit losses changes in the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types and changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent such that improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration in others to consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate macroeconomic forecast the firm compared the modeled credit losses determined using its central and relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios which are two of the five scenarios considered in estimating the allowances for loan losses and lendingrelated commitments the central and relative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of mevs but differed in the levels paths and peakstroughs of those variables over the eightquarter forecast period for example compared to the firms central scenario described on page and in note the firms relative adverse scenario assumes a significantly elevated us unemployment rate through the first half of averaging higher over the eightquarter forecast with a peak difference of nearly in the fourth quarter of lower us real gdp with a slower recovery remaining nearly lower at the end of the eightquarter forecast with a peak difference of nearly in the first quarter of and an further deterioration in the national hpi with a trough in the first quarter of this analysis is not intended to estimate expected future changes in the allowance for credit losses for a number of reasons including the firm has placed significant weight on its adverse scenarios in estimating its allowance for credit losses as of june and accordingly the existing allowance already reflects credit losses beyond those estimated under the central scenario the changes in the mevs are not intended to imply managements expectation of the extent or nature of future deterioration in mevs the impacts of changes in many mevs are both interrelated and nonlinear so the results of this analysis cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe changes in macroeconomic variables the covid19 pandemic has stressed many mevs at a speed and to degrees not seen in recent history adding significantly higher degrees of uncertainty around modeled credit loss estimations which use scenarios outside of historical experience significant changes in the expected severity and duration of the economic downturn caused by the covid19 pandemic the effects of government support and customer assistance and the speed of the subsequent recovery could significantly affect the firms estimate of expected credit losses irrespective of the estimated sensitivities described below to demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to macroeconomic forecasts as of june the firm compared the modeled estimates under its relative adverse scenario to its central scenario without considering the additional weight the firm has placed on its adverse scenarios or any other offsetting or correlated effects in other qualitative components of the firms allowance for credit losses for these lending exposures the difference between these two scenarios would result in the following an increase of approximately billion for residential real estate loans and lendingrelated commitments an increase of approximately billion for credit card loans an increase of approximately billion for wholesale loans and lendingrelated commitments this analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative calculation which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled lifetime loss estimates based on thencurrent circumstances and conditions recognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain particularly in light of the recent economic conditions the firm believes that its process to consider the available information and associated risks and uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its estimates of expected credit losses were reasonable and appropriate for the period ended june fair value jpmorgan chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value the majority of such assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis including derivatives structured note products and certain securities financing agreements certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis including certain mortgage home equity and other loans where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral assets measured at fair value the following table includes the firms assets measured at fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified within level of the valuation hierarchy refer to note for further information june in billions except ratios total assets at fair value total level assets federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements securities borrowed trading assets tradingdebt and equity instruments derivative receivablesa total trading assets afs securities loans msrs other total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis total assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis total assets measured at fair value total firm assets level assets as a percentage of total firm assetsa level assets as a percentage of total firm assets at fair valuea a for purposes of the table above the derivative receivables total reflects the impact of netting adjustments however the billion of derivative receivables classified as level does not reflect the netting adjustment as such netting is not relevant to a presentation based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset the level balances would be reduced if netting were applied including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral valuation estimating fair value requires the application of judgment the type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the firm for instruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are credit card rewards liability the credit card rewards liability was billion and billion at june and december respectively and is recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets refer to pages of jpmorgan chases form 10k for a description of the significant assumptions and judgments associated with the firms credit card rewards liability income taxes refer to income taxes on page of jpmorgan chases form 10k for a description of the significant assumptions judgments and interpretations associated with the accounting for income taxes litigation reserves refer to note of this form 10q and note of jpmorgan chases form 10k for a description of the significant estimates and judgments associated with establishing litigation reserves therefore classified within level of the valuation hierarchy judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels and in arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level management must first determine the appropriate valuation technique to use second the lack of observability of certain significant inputs requires management to assess all relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including for example transaction details yield curves interest rates prepayment rates default rates volatilities correlations equity or debt prices valuations of comparable instruments foreign exchange rates and credit curves refer to note for a further discussion of the valuation of level instruments including unobservable inputs used for instruments classified in levels and management judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality the firms creditworthiness market funding rates liquidity considerations unobservable parameters and for portfolios that meet specified criteria the size of the net open risk position the judgments made are typically affected by the type of product and its specific contractual terms and the level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a whole in periods of heightened market volatility and uncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider variation of reasonable valuation estimates particularly for positions that are less liquid refer to note for a further discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the firm imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position furthermore while the firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the firms businesses and portfolios the firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value the use of methodologies or assumptions different than those used by the firm could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date refer to note for a detailed discussion of the firms valuation process and hierarchy and its determination of fair value for individual financial instruments goodwill impairment management applies significant judgment when testing goodwill for
