cb awm and corporate as well as riskrated business banking and auto dealer exposures held in ccb for which the wholesale methodology is applied for determining the allowance for credit losses recent deterioration in the macroeconomic environment driven by the impacts of the covid19 pandemic and pressure on oil prices resulted in an increase in the allowance for credit losses with the largest impacts in the oil gas real estate and consumer and retail industries as of march the impacts of the macroeconomic environment have had only a limited impact to the overall credit profile with the investmentgrade percentage at versus at december however criticized exposure increased billion from december to billion at march but remains at relatively low levels compared to the overall size of the portfolio the increase was largely driven by downgrades in oil gas resulting from lower oil prices and impacts from the covid19 pandemic and in consumer retail primarily due to impacts from the covid19 pandemic the continuation or worsening of the effects of the covid19 pandemic on the macroeconomic environment could result in further impacts to credit quality metrics including investmentgrade percentages as well as to criticized and nonperforming exposures and chargeoffs retained loans increased by billion in the three months ended march predominantly driven by the cib and

securities portfolio or from principal investments the investment securities portfolio is predominantly held by treasury and cio in connection with the firms balance sheet or assetliability management objectives principal investments are predominantly privatelyheld financial instruments and are managed in the lobs and corporate investments are typically intended to be held over extended periods and accordingly the firm has no expectation for shortterm realized gains with respect to these investments investment securities risk investment securities risk includes the exposure associated with a default in the payment of principal and interest this risk is mitigated given that the investment securities portfolio held by treasury and cio is predominantly invested in highquality securities at

utilizes valueatrisk var a statistical risk measure to estimate the potential loss from adverse market moves in the current market environment the firm has a single var framework used as a basis for calculating risk management var and regulatory var the firms risk management var is calculated assuming a oneday holding period and an expected tailloss methodology which approximates a confidence level for risk management purposes the firm believes this methodology provides a daily measure of risk that is closely aligned to risk management decisions made by the lobs and corporate and along with other market risk measures provides the appropriate information needed to respond to risk events the firm calculates separately a daily aggregated var in accordance with regulatory rules regulatory var which is used to derive the firms regulatory varbased capital requirements under basel iii the firms var model calculations are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to

interest rate exposure on the firms reported net income is important as interest rate risk represents one of the firms significant market risks interest rate risk arises not only from trading activities but also from the firms traditional banking activities which include extension of loans and credit facilities taking deposits and issuing debt as well as from the investment securities portfolio refer to the table on page of jpmorgan chases form 10k for a summary by lob and corporate identifying positions included in earningsatrisk one way the firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk is through earningsatrisk earningsatrisk estimates the firms interest rate exposure for a given interest rate scenario it is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline which includes net interest income and certain interest rate sensitive fees the baseline uses market interest rates and in the case of deposits pricing assumptions the firm conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest ratesensitive assets and liabilities denominated in us dollars and other currencies nonus dollar currencies these simulations primarily include retained loans deposits deposits with banks investment securities long term debt and any related interest rate hedges and exclude other positions in risk management var and other sensitivitybased measures as described on page of jpmorgan chases form 10k earningsatrisk scenarios estimate the potential change to a net interest income baseline over the following months utilizing multiple assumptions these scenarios include a parallel shift involving changes to both shortterm and longterm rates by an equal amount a steeper yield curve involving holding shortterm rates constant and increasing longterm rates and a flatter yield curve involving increasing shortterm rates and holding longterm rates constant these scenarios consider many different factors including the impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous changes in interest rates from baseline rates forecasted balance sheet as well as modeled prepayment and reinvestment behavior but do not include assumptions about actions that could be taken by the firm in response to any such instantaneous rate changes mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates the time since origination and other factors which are updated periodically based on historical experience the pricing sensitivity of deposits using normalized deposit betas which represent the amount by which deposit rates paid could change upon a given change in market interest rates over the cycle the deposit rates paid in these scenarios differ from actual deposit rates paid particularly for retail deposits due to repricing lags and other factors the firms earningsatrisk scenarios are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the firms balance sheet changes

as severe weather power or telecommunications loss accidents failure of a third party to provide expected services cyberattack flooding transit strikes terrorism health emergencies the spread of infectious diseases or pandemics the safety of the firms employees and customers is of the highest priority the firmwide resiliency program is intended to enable the firm to recover its critical business functions and supporting assets ie staff technology and facilities in the event of a business interruption the program includes governance awareness training and testing of recovery strategies as well as strategic and tactical initiatives to identify assess and manage business interruption and public safety risks the strength and proficiency of the firmwide resiliency program has played an integral role in maintaining the firms business operations during and after various events estimations and model risk management estimations and model risk a subcategory of operational risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused estimation outputs the firm uses models and other analytical and judgment based estimations across various businesses and functions the estimation methods are of varying levels of sophistication and are used for many purposes such as the valuation of positions measurement of risk sizing the allowance for credit losses assessing regulatory capital requirements conducting stress testing and making business decisions while models are inherently imprecise the degree of imprecision or uncertainty can be heightened by the market or economic environment this is particularly true when the current and forecasted environment is significantly different from the historical macroeconomic environments upon which the models were calibrated as the firm has experienced during the covid19 pandemic this uncertainty may necessitate a greater degree of judgment and analytics to inform adjustments to model outputs than in typical periods refer to critical accounting estimates used by the firm on pages and note of this form 10q and estimations and model risk management section on page of jpmorgan chases form 10k for a summary of modelbased valuations and other valuation techniques critical accounting estimates used by the firm jpmorgan chases accounting policies and use of estimates are integral to understanding its reported results the firms most complex accounting estimates require managements judgment to ascertain the appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities the firm has established policies and control procedures intended to ensure that estimation methods including any judgments made as part of such methods are wellcontrolled independently reviewed and applied consistently from period to period the methods used and judgments made reflect among other factors the nature of the assets or liabilities and the related business and risk management strategies which may vary across the firms businesses and portfolios in addition the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner the firm believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of its assets and liabilities are appropriate the following is a brief description of the firms critical accounting estimates involving significant judgments allowance for credit losses the firms allowance for credit losses represents managements estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the firms financial assets measured at amortized cost certain offbalance sheet lendingrelated commitments and investment securities the allowance for credit losses comprises the allowance for loan losses which covers the firms retained loan portfolios scored and riskrated the allowance for lendingrelated commitments and the allowance for credit losses on investment securities which covers the firms htm and afs securities the allowance for credit losses involves significant judgment on a number of matters refer to note and note for further information on the firms policies methodologies and judgments used to determine the firms allowance for credit losses one of the most significant judgments involved in estimating the firms allowance for credit losses relates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses over the eightquarter forecast period within the firms methodology in light of the rapidly evolving economic conditions and forecasts during march management updated its macroeconomic forecast near the end of its credit loss estimation process in early april however changes in the firms assumptions and estimates regarding economic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one reporting period to the next the covid19 pandemic has resulted in a weak labor market and weak overall economic conditions that will affect borrowers across the firms consumer and wholesale lending portfolios and significant judgment is required to estimate the severity and duration of the current economic downturn as well as its potential impact on borrower defaults and loss severities in particular macroeconomic conditions and forecasts regarding the duration and severity of the economic downturn caused by the covid19 pandemic have been rapidly changing and remain highly uncertain and it is difficult to predict exactly how borrower behavior will be impacted by these changes in economic conditions the effectiveness of government support customer relief and enhanced unemployment benefits should act as mitigants to credit losses but the extent of the mitigation impact remains uncertain it is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit losses because management considers a wide variety of factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit losses changes in the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types and changes in factors and input may be directionally inconsistent such that improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration in others however to consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate macroeconomic forecast the firm compared the modeled credit losses determined using two of the five different macroeconomic scenarios considered in the quantitative calculations used in estimating the allowances for loan losses and lendingrelated commitments each scenario included a full suite of macroeconomic variables but differed in the levels paths and peaks of those variables over the eightquarter forecast period the maximum difference in macroeconomic variables between the two scenarios over the eightquarter forecast period was represented by an approximate deterioration in us real gdp an approximate basis point increase in the us unemployment rate and an approximate deterioration in the national house price index this analysis is not intended to estimate expected future changes in the allowance for credit losses for a number of reasons including the changes in the macroeconomic variables are not intended to imply managements expectation of the extent or nature of future deterioration in macroeconomic variables the impacts of changes in many macroeconomic variables are both interrelated and nonlinear so the results of this analysis cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe changes in macroeconomic variables the covid19 pandemic has stressed many macroeconomic variables at a speed and to degrees not seen in recent history adding increased uncertainty around credit loss estimates significant changes in the expected severity and duration of the economic downturn caused by the covid19 pandemic the effects of government support and customer relief and the speed of the subsequent recovery could significantly affect the firms estimate of expected credit losses irrespective of the estimated sensitivities described below to demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to macroeconomic forecasts the difference between these two scenarios would have generated the following effects on the firms modeled credit loss estimates as of march without considering any offsetting or correlated effects in other components of the firms allowance for credit losses for these lending exposures an increase of approximately billion for residential real estate loans and lendingrelated commitments an increase of approximately billion for credit card loans an increase of approximately billion for wholesale loans and lendingrelated commitments this analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance for credit losses as they do not reflect any potential changes in the adjustment to the quantitative calculation which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled lifetime loss estimates based on thencurrent circumstances and conditions recognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain particularly in light of the recent economic conditions the firm believes that its process to consider the available information and associated risks and uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its estimates of expected credit losses were reasonable and appropriate for the period ended march fair value jpmorgan chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value the majority of such assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis including derivatives structured note products and certain securities financing agreements certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis including certain mortgage home equity and other loans where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral assets measured at fair value the following table includes the firms assets measured at fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified within level of the valuation hierarchy

assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis total assets measured at fair value total firm assets level assets as a percentage of total firm assetsa level assets as a percentage of total firm assets at fair valuea a for purposes of the table above the derivative receivables total reflects the impact of netting adjustments however the billion of derivative receivables classified as level does not reflect the netting adjustment as such netting is not relevant to a presentation based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset the level balances would be reduced if netting were applied including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral valuation estimating fair value requires the application of judgment the type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the firm for instruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level of the valuation hierarchy judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels and in arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level management must first determine the appropriate valuation technique to use second the lack of goodwill impairment management applies significant judgment when testing goodwill for impairment the goodwill associated with each business combination is allocated to the related reporting units for goodwill impairment testing refer to goodwill impairment on page of jpmorgan chases form 10k for a description of the significant valuation judgments associated with goodwill impairment refer to note for additional information on goodwill including the goodwill impairment assessment as of march credit card rewards liability the credit card rewards liability was

form 10k for a description of the significant estimates and judgments associated with establishing litigation reserves observability of certain significant inputs requires management to assess all relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including for example transaction details yield curves interest rates prepayment rates default rates volatilities correlations equity or debt prices valuations of comparable instruments foreign exchange rates and credit curves refer to note for a further discussion of the valuation of level instruments including unobservable inputs used for instruments classified in levels and management judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality the firms creditworthiness market funding rates liquidity considerations unobservable parameters and for portfolios that meet specified criteria the size of the net open risk position the judgments made are typically affected by the type of product and its specific contractual terms and the level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a whole in periods of heightened market volatility and uncertainty as was experienced in the period ended march judgments are further affected by the wider variation of reasonable valuation estimates particularly for positions that are less liquid refer to note for a further discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the firm imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position furthermore while the firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the firms businesses and portfolios the firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value the use of methodologies or assumptions different than those used by the firm could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date refer to note for a detailed discussion of the firms valuation process and hierarchy and its
