item risk factors the following discussion sets forth the material risk factors that could affect jpmorgan chases financial condition and operations readers should not consider any descriptions of these factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the firm any of the risk factors discussed below could by itself or combined with other factors materially and adversely affect jpmorgan chases business results of operations financial condition capital position liquidity competitive position or reputation including by materially increasing expenses or decreasing revenues which could result in material losses or a decrease in earnings regulatory jpmorgan chases businesses are highly regulated and the laws and regulations that apply to jpmorgan chase have a significant impact on its business and operations jpmorgan chase is a financial services firm with operations worldwide jpmorgan chase must comply with the laws rules and regulations that apply to its operations in all of the jurisdictions around the world in which it does business regulation of financial services is extensive jpmorgan chase has experienced an extended period of significant change in laws and regulations affecting the financial services industry both within and outside the us the supervision of financial services firms also expanded significantly the increased regulation and supervision of jpmorgan chase has affected the way that it conducts its business and structures its operations existing and new laws and regulations and expanded supervision could require jpmorgan chase to make further changes to its business and operations these changes could result in jpmorgan chase incurring additional costs for complying with laws and regulations and could reduce its profitability for example existing and new laws and regulations have in the past and could in the future require jpmorgan chase to table start limit the products and services that it offers table endtable start reduce the liquidity that it can provide through its marketmaking activities table endtable start stop or discourage it from engaging in business opportunities that it might otherwise pursue table endtable start recognize losses in the value of assets that it holds table endtable start pay higher taxes assessments levies or other governmental charges including in connection with the resolution of tax examinations table endtable start dispose of certain assets and do so at times or prices that are disadvantageous table endtable start impose restrictions on certain business activities or table endtable start increase the prices that it charges for products and services which could reduce the demand for them table end differences in financial services regulation can be disadvantageous for jpmorgan chases business the content and application of laws and regulations affecting financial services firms sometimes vary according to factors such as the size of the firm the jurisdiction in which it is organized or operates and other criteria for example table start larger firms are often subject to more stringent supervision and regulation table endtable start financial technology companies and other nontraditional competitors may not be subject to banking regulation or may be supervised by a national or state regulatory agency that does not have the same resources or regulatory priorities as the regulatory agencies which supervise more diversified financial services firms or table endtable start the financial services regulatory framework in a particular jurisdiction may favor financial institutions that are based in that jurisdiction table end these differences in the regulatory framework can result in a firm such as jpmorgan chase losing market share to competitors that are less regulated or not subject to regulation especially with respect to unregulated financial products there can also be significant differences in the ways that similar regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry are implemented in the us and in other countries table start table end and regions in which jpmorgan chase does business for example when adopting rules that are intended to implement a global regulatory initiative or standard a national regulator may introduce additional or more restrictive requirements which can create competitive disadvantages for financial services firms such as jpmorgan chase that may be subject to those enhanced regulations legislative and regulatory initiatives outside the us could require jpmorgan chase to make significant modifications to its operations and legal entity structure in the relevant countries or regions in order to comply with those requirements these include laws and regulations that have been adopted or proposed relating to table start the resolution of financial institutions table endtable start the establishment of locallybased intermediate holding companies or operating subsidiaries table endtable start requirements to maintain minimum amounts of capital or liquidity in locallybased subsidiaries table endtable start the separation or ring fencing of core banking products and services from markets activities table endtable start requirements for executing or settling transactions on exchanges or through central counterparties ccps table endtable start position limits and reporting rules for derivatives table endtable start governance and accountability regimes table endtable start conduct of business requirements and table endtable start restrictions on compensation table end these types of differences in financial services regulation or inconsistencies or conflicts between laws and regulations between different jurisdictions could require jpmorgan chase to table start divest assets or restructure its operations table endtable start absorb increased operational capital and liquidity costs table endtable start change the prices that it charges for its products and services table endtable start curtail the products and services that it offers to its customers and clients or table endtable start incur higher costs for complying with different legal and regulatory frameworks table end any or all of these factors could harm jpmorgan chases ability to compete against other firms that are not subject to the same laws and regulations or supervisory oversight or harm jpmorgan chases businesses results of operations and profitability heightened regulatory scrutiny of jpmorgan chases businesses has increased its compliance costs and could result in restrictions on its operations jpmorgan chases operations are subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny from regulatory authorities in many jurisdictions where jpmorgan chase does business jpmorgan chase has paid significant fines provided other monetary relief incurred other penalties and experienced other repercussions in connection with resolving several investigations and enforcement actions by governmental agencies jpmorgan chase could become subject to similar regulatory resolutions or other actions in the future and addressing the requirements of any such resolutions or actions could result in jpmorgan chase incurring higher operational and compliance costs or needing to comply with other restrictions in connection with resolving specific regulatory investigations or enforcement actions certain regulators have required jpmorgan chase and other financial institutions to admit wrongdoing with respect to the activities that gave rise to the resolution these types of admissions can lead to table start greater exposure in civil litigation table endtable start damage to reputation table endtable start disqualification from doing business with certain clients or customers or in specific jurisdictions or table endtable start other direct and indirect adverse effects table end furthermore us government officials have demonstrated a willingness to bring criminal actions against financial institutions and have demanded that institutions plead guilty to criminal offenses or admit other wrongdoing in connection with resolving regulatory investigations or enforcement actions resolutions of this type can have significant collateral consequences for the subject financial institution including table start loss of clients customers and business table endtable start restrictions on offering certain products or services and table endtable start losing permission to operate certain businesses either temporarily or permanently table end jpmorgan chase expects that it and other financial services firms will continue to be subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and governmental investigations and enforcement actions jpmorgan chase also expects that regulators will continue to insist that financial institutions be penalized for actual or deemed violations of law with formal and punitive enforcement actions including the imposition of significant monetary and other sanctions rather than resolving these matters through informal supervisory actions furthermore if jpmorgan chase fails to meet the requirements of any resolution of a governmental investigation or enforcement action or to maintain risk and control processes that meet table start table end part i the heightened standards established by its regulators it could be required to table start enter into further resolutions of investigations or enforcement actions table endtable start pay additional regulatory fines penalties or judgments or table endtable start accept material regulatory restrictions on or changes in the management of its businesses table end in these circumstances jpmorgan chase could also become subject to other sanctions or to prosecution or civil litigation with respect to the conduct that gave rise to an investigation or enforcement action complying with economic sanctions and anticorruption and antimoney laundering laws and regulations can increase jpmorgan chases operational and compliance costs and risks jpmorgan chase must comply with economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by the office of foreign assets control ofac and similar national and multinational bodies and governmental agencies outside the us as well as anticorruption and antimoney laundering laws and regulations throughout the world jpmorgan chase can incur higher costs and face greater compliance risks in structuring and operating its businesses to comply with these requirements furthermore a violation of a sanction or embargo program or anticorruption or antimoney laundering laws and regulations could subject jpmorgan chase and individual employees to regulatory enforcement actions as well as significant civil and criminal penalties jpmorgan chases operations can be constrained in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory frameworks if the legal and regulatory system in a particular country is less predictable this can create a more difficult environment in which to conduct business for example any of the following could hamper jpmorgan chases operations and reduce its earnings in these types of countries table start the absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or guidance for engaging in specific types of business or transactions table endtable start conflicting or ambiguous laws and regulations or the inconsistent application or interpretation of existing laws and regulations table endtable start uncertainty concerning the enforceability of contractual intellectual property or other obligations table endtable start difficulty in competing in economies in which the government controls or protects all or a portion of the local economy or specific businesses or where graft or corruption may be pervasive and table endtable start the threat of arbitrary regulatory investigations civil litigations or criminal prosecutions the termination of licenses required to operate in the local market or the table end suspension of business relationships with governmental bodies conducting business in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory regimes could require jpmorgan chase to devote significant additional resources to understanding and monitoring changes in local laws and regulations as well as structuring its operations to comply with local laws and regulations and implementing and administering related internal policies and procedures there can be no assurance that jpmorgan chase will always be successful in its efforts to fully understand and to conduct its business in compliance with the laws and regulations of all of the jurisdictions in which it operates and the risk of noncompliance can be greater in countries that have less predictable legal and regulatory systems requirements for the orderly resolution of jpmorgan chase could result in jpmorgan chase having to restructure or reorganize its businesses jpmorgan chase is required under federal reserve and fdic rules to prepare and submit periodically to those agencies a detailed plan for rapid and orderly resolution in bankruptcy without extraordinary government support in the event of material financial distress or failure the agencies evaluation of jpmorgan chases resolution plan may change and the requirements for resolution plans may be modified from time to time any such determinations or modifications could result in jpmorgan chase needing to make changes to its legal entity structure or to certain internal or external activities which could increase its funding or operational costs or hamper its ability to serve clients and customers if the federal reserve and the fdic were to determine that a resolution plan submitted by jpmorgan chase has deficiencies they could jointly impose more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on jpmorgan chases growth activities or operations after two years if the deficiencies are not cured the agencies could also require that jpmorgan chase restructure reorganize or divest assets or businesses in ways that could materially and adversely affect jpmorgan chases operations and strategy holders of jpmorgan chase cos debt and equity securities will absorb losses if it were to enter into a resolution federal reserve rules require that jpmorgan chase co the parent company maintain minimum levels of unsecured external longterm debt and other lossabsorbing capacity with specific terms eligible ltd for purposes of recapitalizing jpmorgan chases operating subsidiaries if the parent company were to enter into a resolution either table start in a bankruptcy proceeding under chapter of the us bankruptcy code or table endtable start in a receivership administered by the fdic under title ii of the doddfrank act title ii table end table start table end if the parent company were to enter into a resolution holders of eligible ltd and other debt and equity securities of the parent company will absorb the losses of the parent company and its subsidiaries the preferred single point of entry strategy under jpmorgan chases resolution plan contemplates that only the parent company would enter bankruptcy proceedings jpmorgan chases subsidiaries would be recapitalized as needed so that they could continue normal operations or subsequently be divested or wound down in an orderly manner as a result the parent companys losses and any losses incurred by its subsidiaries would be imposed first on holders of the parent companys equity securities and thereafter on its unsecured creditors including holders of eligible ltd and other debt securities claims of holders of those securities would have a junior position to the claims of creditors of jpmorgan chases subsidiaries and to the claims of priority as determined by statute and secured creditors of the parent company accordingly in a resolution of the parent company in bankruptcy holders of eligible ltd and other debt securities of the parent company would realize value only to the extent available to the parent company as a shareholder of jpmorgan chase bank na and its other subsidiaries and only after any claims of priority and secured creditors of the parent company have been fully repaid the fdic has similarly indicated that a single point of entry recapitalization model could be a desirable strategy to resolve a systemically important financial institution such as the parent company under title ii however the fdic has not formally adopted a single point of entry resolution strategy if the parent company were to approach or enter into a resolution none of the parent company the federal reserve or the fdic is obligated to follow jpmorgan chases preferred strategy and losses to holders of eligible ltd and other debt and equity securities of the parent company under whatever strategy is ultimately followed could be greater than they might have been under jpmorgan chases preferred strategy political the departure of the uk from the eu could negatively affect jpmorgan chases business results of operations and operating model it remains highly uncertain how the departure of the uk from the eu which is commonly referred to as brexit will affect financial services firms such as jpmorgan chase that conduct substantial operations in the eu from legal entities that are organized in or operating from the uk it is possible that the transition period following the uks departure from the eu on january will expire on december without any agreement having been reached between the uk and the eu concerning whether or to what extent ukbased firms may conduct financial services activities within the eu it is also possible that any agreement reached between the uk and the eu may depending on the final outcome of the ongoing negotiations and related legislative developments table start impede the ability of ukbased financial services firms to conduct business in the eu table endtable start fail to address significant unresolved issues relating to the crossborder conduct of financial services activities or table endtable start apply only temporarily table end jpmorgan chase has been making appropriate modifications to its legal entity structure and operations in the eu the locations in which it operates and the staffing in those locations to address the departure of the uk from the eu if the uk and the eu fail to reach an agreement on their future relationship before the end of the transition period or if any other outcome persists that does not assure ongoing access for ukbased financial services firms to the eu market the types of structural and operational changes that jpmorgan chase is in the process of making to its european operations may result in jpmorgan chase having to sustain a more fragmented operating model across its uk eu and other operating entities due to considerations such as operating expenses liquidity leverage and capital the modified european operating framework will be more complex less efficient and more costly than would otherwise have been the case a disorderly withdrawal of the uk from the eu or unexpected consequences of the withdrawal could have significant and immediate destabilizing effects on economic and market conditions in the region and globally in particular crossborder financial services activities could be severely disrupted depending on circumstances that may exist following the withdrawal including table start the possibility that financial institutions their clients and counterparties and other market participants may not be positioned to continue to do business through eubased legal entities table endtable start reduction or fragmentation of market liquidity that may be caused if significant market participants including trading venues and ccps that are currently based in the uk have not completed arrangements to conduct operations from the eu either in the near term or if authorized to continue to operate from the uk on a transitional basis after any transitional or temporary relief has expired table endtable start uncertainties concerning the application and interpretation of laws and regulations relating to crossborder financial services activities table endtable start inability to engage in certain financial services activities through eubased legal entities to the extent that licenses or temporary permission to engage in such activities have not been granted timely by local regulators table end table start table end part i table start unexpected or unfavorable changes in laws and regulations governmental policies or public sentiment and table endtable start losses due to process errors or incorrect judgments concerning economic political or regulatory developments table end any or all of the above factors could have an adverse effect on the overall operation of the european financial services market as well as jpmorgan chases business operations and earnings in the uk the eu and globally economic uncertainty or instability caused by political developments can hurt jpmorgan chases businesses the economic environment and market conditions in which jpmorgan chase operates continue to be uncertain due to political developments in the us and other countries certain monetary fiscal and other policy initiatives and proposals could cause a contraction in us and global economic growth and higher volatility in the financial markets including table start monetary and fiscal policies and actions taken by the federal reserve and other central banks or governmental authorities including any suspension or reversal of largescale asset purchases table endtable start inability to reach political consensus to keep the us government open table endtable start isolationist foreign policies table endtable start the implementation of tariffs and other protectionist trade policies table endtable start political pressure on monetary policy decisions of central banks or table endtable start the possible withdrawal or reduction of government support for the federal national mortgage association and the federal home loan mortgage corporation together the us gses table end these types of political developments and uncertainty about the possible outcomes of these developments could table start erode investor confidence in the us economy and financial markets which could potentially undermine the status of the us dollar as a safe haven currency table endtable start provoke retaliatory countermeasures by other countries and otherwise heighten tensions in diplomatic relations table endtable start increase concerns about whether the us government will be funded and its outstanding debt serviced at any particular time and table endtable start result in periodic shutdowns of the us government or governments in other countries table end these factors could lead to table start slower growth rates rising inflation or recession table endtable start greater market volatility table end table start a contraction of available credit and the widening of credit spreads table endtable start diminished investor and consumer confidence table endtable start lower investment growth table endtable start largescale sales of government debt and other debt and equity securities in the us and other countries table endtable start reduced commercial activity among trading partners table endtable start the potential for a currency redenomination by a particular country table endtable start the possible departure of a country from or the dissolution of a political or economic alliance or treaty table endtable start potential expropriation or nationalization of assets table endtable start other market dislocations including the spread of unfavorable economic conditions from a particular country or region to other countries or regions table end any of these potential outcomes could cause jpmorgan chase to suffer losses on its marketmaking positions or in its investment portfolio reduce its liquidity and capital levels hamper its ability to deliver products and services to its clients and customers and weaken its results of operations and financial condition market economic and market events and conditions can materially affect jpmorgan chases businesses and investment and marketmaking positions jpmorgan chases results of operations can be negatively affected by adverse changes in any of the following table start investor consumer and business sentiment table endtable start events that reduce confidence in the financial markets table endtable start inflation or deflation table endtable start high unemployment or conversely a tightening labor market table endtable start the availability and cost of capital liquidity and credit table endtable start levels and volatility of interest rates including overnight repo rates credit spreads and market prices for currencies equities and commodities and the duration of any changes in levels or volatility table endtable start the economic effects of outbreaks of hostilities terrorism or other geopolitical instabilities cyberattacks climate change natural disasters severe weather conditions health emergencies the spread of infectious diseases or pandemics and table endtable start the health of the us and global economies table end all of these are affected by global economic market and political events and conditions as well as regulatory restrictions table start table end in addition jpmorgan chases investment portfolio and marketmaking businesses can suffer losses due to unanticipated market events including table start severe declines in asset values table endtable start unexpected credit events table endtable start unforeseen events or conditions that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated and vice versa table endtable start the inability to effectively hedge market and other risks related to marketmaking position or table endtable start other market risks that may not have been appropriately taken into account in the development structuring or pricing of a financial instrument table end if jpmorgan chase experiences significant losses in its investment portfolio or from marketmaking activities this could reduce jpmorgan chases profitability and its liquidity and capital levels and thereby constrain the growth of its businesses jpmorgan chases consumer businesses can be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions jpmorgan chases consumer businesses are particularly affected by us and global economic conditions including table start interest rates table endtable start the rates of inflation and unemployment table endtable start housing prices table endtable start the level of consumer and small business confidence table endtable start changes in consumer spending or in the level of consumer debt and table endtable start the number of personal bankruptcies table end a rapid increase in interest rates could negatively affect consumer credit performance to the extent that consumers are less able to service their debts sustained low growth low or negative interest rates inflationary pressures or recessionary conditions could diminish customer demand for the products and services offered by jpmorgan chases consumer businesses these conditions could also increase the cost to provide those products and services adverse economic conditions could also lead to an increase in delinquencies and higher net chargeoffs which can reduce jpmorgan chases earnings these consequences could be significantly worse in certain geographies where high levels of unemployment have resulted from declining industrial or manufacturing activity or where high levels of consumer debt such as outstanding student loans impair the ability of customers to pay their other consumer loan obligations jpmorgan chases earnings from its consumer businesses could also be adversely affected by governmental policies and actions that affect consumers including table start policies and initiatives relating to medical insurance education immigration and employment status table end table start the inability to reach political consensus to keep the us government open and funded and table endtable start policies aimed at the economy more broadly such as infrastructure spending and global trade which could result in higher inflation or reductions in consumer disposable income table end in addition governmental proposals to permit student loan obligations to be discharged in bankruptcy proceedings could if enacted into law encourage certain of jpmorgan chases customers to declare personal bankruptcy and thereby trigger defaults and chargeoffs of credit card and other consumer loans extended to those customers unfavorable market and economic conditions can have an adverse effect on jpmorgan chases wholesale businesses in jpmorgan chases wholesale businesses market and economic factors can affect the volume of transactions that jpmorgan chase executes for its clients or for which it advises clients and therefore the revenue that jpmorgan chase receives from those transactions these factors can also influence the willingness of other financial institutions and investors to participate in capital markets transactions that jpmorgan chase manages such as loan syndications or securities underwritings furthermore if a significant and sustained deterioration in market conditions were to occur the profitability of jpmorgan chases capital markets businesses including its loan syndication securities underwriting and leveraged lending activities could be reduced to the extent that those businesses table start earn less fee revenue due to lower transaction volumes including when clients are unwilling or unable to refinance their outstanding debt obligations in unfavorable market conditions or table endtable start dispose of portions of credit commitments at a loss or hold larger residual positions in credit commitments that cannot be sold at favorable prices table end an adverse change in market conditions in particular segments of the economy such as a sudden and severe downturn in oil and gas prices or an increase in commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on clients of jpmorgan chase whose operations or financial condition are directly or indirectly dependent on the health or stability of those market segments as well as clients that are engaged in related businesses jpmorgan chase could incur losses on its loans and other credit commitments to clients that operate in or are dependent on any sector of the economy that is under stress the fees that jpmorgan chase earns from managing client assets or holding assets under custody for clients could be diminished by declining asset values or other adverse macroeconomic conditions for example higher interest rates or a downturn in financial markets could affect the valuations of client assets that jpmorgan chase manages or holds under custody which in turn could affect jpmorgan chases revenue from fees that are based on the amount of assets under management or custody similarly adverse table start table end part i macroeconomic or market conditions could prompt outflows from jpmorgan chase funds or accounts or cause clients to invest in products that generate lower revenue substantial and unexpected withdrawals from a jpmorgan chase fund can also hamper the investment performance of the fund particularly if the outflows create the need for the fund to dispose of fund assets at disadvantageous times or prices and could lead to further withdrawals based on the weaker investment performance an economic downturn that results in lower consumer and business spending could also have a negative impact on certain of jpmorgan chases wholesale clients and thereby diminish jpmorgan chases earnings from its wholesale operations for example the businesses of certain of jpmorgan chases wholesale clients are dependent on consistent streams of rental income from commercial real estate properties which are owned or being built by those clients severe and sustained adverse economic conditions could reduce the rental cash flows that owners or developers receive from those properties which in turn could depress the values of the properties and impair the ability of borrowers to service or refinance their commercial real estate loans these consequences could result in jpmorgan chase experiencing higher delinquencies defaults and writeoffs within its commercial real estate loan portfolio and incurring higher costs for servicing a larger volume of delinquent loans in that portfolio thereby reducing jpmorgan chases earnings from its wholesale businesses changes in interest rates and credit spreads can adversely affect certain of jpmorgan chases revenue and income streams jpmorgan chase can generally be expected to earn higher net interest income when interest rates are increasing however higher interest rates can also lead to table start fewer originations of commercial and residential real estate loans table endtable start losses on underwriting exposures table endtable start the loss of deposits including in the event that jpmorgan chase makes incorrect assumptions about depositor behavior table endtable start lower net interest income if central banks introduce interest rate increases more quickly than anticipated and this results in a misalignment in the pricing of shortterm and longterm borrowings table endtable start less liquidity in the financial markets and table endtable start higher funding costs table end all of these outcomes could adversely affect jpmorgan chases revenues and its liquidity and capital levels higher interest rates can also negatively affect the payment performance on loans within jpmorgan chases consumer and wholesale loan portfolios that are linked to variable interest rates if borrowers of variable rate loans are unable to afford higher interest payments those borrowers may reduce or stop making payments thereby causing jpmorgan chase to incur losses and increased operational costs related to servicing a higher volume of delinquent loans on the other hand a low or negative interest rate environment may cause table start net interest margins to be compressed which could reduce the amounts that jpmorgan chase earns on its investment portfolio to the extent that it is unable to reinvest contemporaneously in higheryielding instruments table endtable start unanticipated or adverse changes in depositor behavior which could negatively affect jpmorgan chases broader asset and liability management strategy and table endtable start a reduction in the value of jpmorgan chases mortgage servicing rights msrs asset thereby decreasing revenues table end when credit spreads widen it becomes more expensive for jpmorgan chase to borrow jpmorgan chases credit spreads may widen or narrow not only in response to events and circumstances that are specific to jpmorgan chase but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical events and conditions changes in jpmorgan chases credit spreads will affect positively or negatively jpmorgan chases earnings on certain liabilities such as derivatives that are recorded at fair value jpmorgan chases results may be materially affected by market fluctuations and significant changes in the value of financial instruments the value of securities derivatives and other financial instruments which jpmorgan chase owns or in which it makes markets can be materially affected by market fluctuations market volatility illiquid market conditions and other disruptions in the financial markets may make it extremely difficult to value certain financial instruments particularly during periods of market displacement subsequent valuations of financial instruments in future periods in light of factors then prevailing may result in significant changes in the value of these instruments in addition at the time of any disposition of these financial instruments the price that jpmorgan chase ultimately realizes will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their current fair value any of these factors could cause a decline in the value of jpmorgan chases financial instruments which may have an adverse effect on jpmorgan chases results of operations jpmorgan chases risk management and monitoring processes including its stress testing framework seek to quantify and control jpmorgan chases exposure to more extreme market moves however jpmorgan chase could realize significant losses if extreme market events were to occur under extreme market conditions hedging and other risk management strategies may not be as effective at table start table end mitigating losses as they would be under more normal market conditions credit jpmorgan chase can be adversely affected by the financial condition of clients counterparties custodians and ccps jpmorgan chase routinely executes transactions with brokers and dealers commercial and investment banks mutual and hedge funds investment managers and other types of financial institutions and market participants many of these transactions expose jpmorgan chase to the credit risk of its clients and counterparties and can involve jpmorgan chase in disputes and litigation if a client or counterparty defaults jpmorgan chase can also be subject to losses or liability where a financial institution that it has appointed to provide custodial services for client assets or funds becomes insolvent as a result of fraud or the failure to abide by existing laws and obligations including under the eu alternative investment fund managers directive a default by or the financial or operational failure of a ccp through which jpmorgan chase executes contracts would require jpmorgan chase to replace those contracts thereby increasing its operational costs and potentially resulting in losses jpmorgan chase can also be exposed to losses if a member of a ccp in which jpmorgan chase is also a member defaults on its obligations to the ccp because of requirements that each member of the ccp absorb a portion of those losses as part of its clearing services activities jpmorgan chase is also exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its clients which it seeks to mitigate by requiring clients to provide adequate collateral jpmorgan chase is also exposed to intraday credit risk of its clients in connection with providing cash management clearing custodial and other transaction services to those clients if a client for which jpmorgan chase provides these services becomes bankrupt or insolvent jpmorgan chase may incur losses become involved in disputes and litigation with one or more ccps the clients bankruptcy estate and other creditors or be subject to regulatory investigations all of the foregoing events can increase jpmorgan chases operational and litigation costs and jpmorgan chase may suffer losses to the extent that any collateral that it has received is insufficient to cover those losses jpmorgan chase can also be subject to bearing its share of nondefault losses incurred by a ccp including losses from custodial settlement or investment activities or due to cyber or other security breaches disputes may arise with counterparties to derivatives contracts with regard to the terms the settlement procedures or the value of underlying collateral the disposition of those disputes could cause jpmorgan chase to incur unexpected transaction operational and legal costs or result in credit losses these consequences can also impair jpmorgan chases ability to effectively manage its credit risk exposure from its market activities or cause harm to jpmorgan chases reputation the financial or operational failure of a significant market participant such as a major financial institution or a ccp or concerns about the creditworthiness of such a market participant can have a cascading effect within the financial markets jpmorgan chases businesses could be significantly disrupted by such an event particularly if it leads to other market participants incurring significant losses experiencing liquidity issues or defaulting jpmorgan chase is likely to have significant interrelationships with and credit exposure to such a significant market participant and would seek to unwind or hedge positions in securities derivatives and other obligations in multiple jurisdictions during a period of heightened market volatility jpmorgan chase may suffer losses if the value of collateral declines in stressed market conditions during periods of market stress or illiquidity jpmorgan chases credit risk may be further increased when jpmorgan chase cannot realize the fair value of the collateral held by it or when collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan derivative or other exposure due to it furthermore disputes with counterparties concerning the valuation of collateral may increase in times of significant market stress volatility or illiquidity and jpmorgan chase could suffer losses during these periods if it is unable to realize the fair value of collateral or to manage declines in the value of collateral jpmorgan chase could incur significant losses arising from concentrations of credit and market risk jpmorgan chase is exposed to greater credit and market risk to the extent that groupings of its clients or counterparties table start engage in similar or related businesses or in businesses in related industries table endtable start do business in the same geographic region or table endtable start have business profiles models or strategies that could cause their ability to meet their obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions table end for example a significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of jpmorgan chases borrowers or counterparties could lead to concerns about the creditworthiness of other borrowers or counterparties in similar related or dependent industries this type of interrelationship could exacerbate jpmorgan chases credit liquidity and market risk exposure and potentially cause it to incur losses including fair value losses in its marketmaking businesses similarly challenging economic conditions that affect a particular industry or geographic area could lead to concerns about the credit quality of jpmorgan chases borrowers or counterparties not only in that particular industry or geography but in related or dependent industries wherever located these conditions could also heighten concerns about the ability of customers of jpmorgan chases consumer businesses who live in those areas or work in those affected industries or related or table start table end part i dependent industries to meet their obligations to jpmorgan chase jpmorgan chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit and market risk exposures to assess the potential risks of concentration or contagion but its efforts to diversify or hedge its exposures against those risks may not be successful jpmorgan chases consumer businesses can also be harmed by an excessive expansion of consumer credit by bank or nonbank competitors heightened competition for certain types of consumer loans could prompt industrywide reactions such as significant reductions in the pricing or margins of those loans or the making of loans to lesscreditworthy borrowers if large numbers of consumers subsequently default on their loans whether due to weak credit profiles an economic downturn or other factors this could impair their ability to repay obligations owed to jpmorgan chase and result in higher chargeoffs and other creditrelated losses more broadly widespread defaults on consumer debt could lead to recessionary conditions in the us economy and jpmorgan chases consumer businesses may earn lower revenues in such an environment if jpmorgan chase is unable to reduce positions effectively during a market dislocation this can increase both the market and credit risks associated with those positions and the level of riskweighted assets rwa that jpmorgan chase holds on its balance sheet these factors could adversely affect jpmorgan chases capital position funding costs and the profitability of its businesses liquidity liquidity is critical to jpmorgan chases ability to operate its businesses jpmorgan chases liquidity could be impaired at any given time by factors such as table start marketwide illiquidity or disruption table endtable start unforeseen liquidity or capital requirements including as a result of changes in laws rules and regulations table endtable start inability to sell assets or to sell assets at favorable times or prices table endtable start default by a ccp or other significant market participant table endtable start unanticipated outflows of cash or collateral table endtable start unexpected loss of consumer deposits caused by changes in consumer behavior and table endtable start lack of market or customer confidence in jpmorgan chase or financial institutions in general table end a reduction in jpmorgan chases liquidity may be caused by events over which it has little or no control for example during periods of market stress low investor confidence and significant market illiquidity could result in higher funding costs for jpmorgan chase and could limit its access to some of its traditional sources of liquidity there is no assurance that severe conditions of this type will not occur jpmorgan chase may need to raise funding from alternative sources if its access to stable and lowercost sources of funding such as deposits and borrowings from federal home loan banks is reduced alternative sources of funding could be more expensive or limited in availability jpmorgan chases funding costs could also be negatively affected by actions that jpmorgan chase may take in order to table start satisfy applicable liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio requirements table endtable start address obligations under its resolution plan or table endtable start satisfy regulatory requirements in jurisdictions outside the us relating to the prepositioning of liquidity in subsidiaries that are material legal entities table end more generally if jpmorgan chase fails to effectively manage its liquidity this could constrain its ability to fund or invest in its businesses and subsidiaries including in particular its brokerdealer subsidiaries and thereby adversely affect its results of operations jpmorgan chase co is a holding company and depends on the cash flows of its subsidiaries to make payments on its outstanding securities jpmorgan chase co is a holding company that holds the stock of jpmorgan chase bank na and an intermediate holding company jpmorgan chase holdings llc the ihc the ihc in turn holds the stock of substantially all of jpmorgan chases subsidiaries other than jpmorgan chase bank na and its subsidiaries the ihc also owns other assets and owes intercompany indebtedness to the holding company the holding company is obligated to contribute to the ihc substantially all the net proceeds received from securities issuances including issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of

consideration these reforms may cause benchmarks to perform differently than in the past or to disappear entirely or have other consequences which cannot be fully anticipated any of the benchmark reforms which have been proposed or implemented or the general increased regulatory scrutiny of benchmarks could also increase the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the

cease certain operations or practices significant liabilities or regulatory fines penalties or other sanctions any of these could damage jpmorgan chases reputation and otherwise adversely affect its businesses in recent years wellpublicized allegations involving the misuse or inappropriate sharing of personal information have led to expanded governmental scrutiny of practices relating to the safeguarding of personal information and the use or sharing of personal data by companies in the us and other countries that scrutiny has in some cases resulted in and could in the future lead to the adoption of stricter laws and regulations relating to the use and sharing of personal information these types of laws and regulations could prohibit or significantly restrict financial services firms such as jpmorgan chase from sharing information among affiliates or with third parties such as vendors and thereby increase compliance costs or could restrict jpmorgan chases use of personal data when developing or offering products or services to customers these restrictions could also inhibit jpmorgan chases development or marketing of certain products or services or increase the costs of

upgrade its systems to protect them against cyberattacks however jpmorgan chase has experienced security breaches due to cyberattacks in the past and it is inevitable that additional breaches will occur in the future any such breach could result in serious and harmful consequences for jpmorgan chase or its clients and customers a principal reason that jpmorgan chase cannot provide absolute security against cyberattacks is that it may not always be possible to anticipate detect or recognize threats to jpmorgan chases systems or to implement effective preventive measures against all breaches this is because table start the techniques used in cyberattacks change frequently and are increasingly sophisticated and therefore may not be recognized until launched table endtable start cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources including third parties who are or may be involved in organized crime or linked to terrorist organizations or hostile countries or whose objective is to disrupt the operations of financial institutions more generally table endtable start jpmorgan chase does not have control over the cybersecurity of the systems of the large number of

and it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed while such an investigation is ongoing jpmorgan chase may not necessarily know the full extent of the harm caused by the cyberattack and that damage may continue to spread these factors may inhibit jpmorgan chases ability to provide full and reliable information about the cyberattack to its clients customers counterparties and regulators as well as the public furthermore it may not be clear how best to contain and remediate the harm caused by the cyberattack and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated any or all of these factors could further increase the costs and consequences of a cyberattack jpmorgan chases operations results

and facilities in the event of a business interruption there can be no assurance that jpmorgan chases resiliency plans will fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks to jpmorgan chase or its clients and customers in particular jpmorgan chases ability to respond effectively to a business interruption could be hampered to the extent that the members of its workforce physical assets or systems and other support infrastructure needed to address the event are geographically dispersed or conversely if a catastrophic event occurs in an area in which a critical segment of jpmorgan chases workforce physical assets or systems and other support infrastructure is concentrated in addition should emergency or catastrophic events such as severe or abnormal weather conditions become more

any deficiencies in the quality or effectiveness of jpmorgan chases data gathering and validation processes could result in ineffective risk management practices these deficiencies could also result in inaccurate risk reporting many of jpmorgan chases risk management strategies and techniques consider historical market behavior these strategies and techniques are based to some degree on managements subjective judgment for example many models used by jpmorgan chase are based on assumptions regarding historical correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators in times of market stress including difficult or less liquid market environments or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated conversely previouslycorrelated indicators may make unrelated movements at those times sudden market movements and unanticipated or unidentified market or economic movements could in some circumstances limit the effectiveness of jpmorgan chases risk management strategies causing it to incur losses jpmorgan chase could incur significant losses its capital levels could be reduced and it could face greater regulatory scrutiny if its models or estimations prove to be inadequate jpmorgan chase has developed and uses a variety of models and other analytical and judgmentbased estimations to measure monitor and implement controls over its market credit liquidity operational and other risks these models and estimations are based on a variety of assumptions and historical trends and are periodically reviewed and modified as necessary the models and estimations that jpmorgan chase uses may not be effective in all cases to identify observe and mitigate risk due to a variety of factors such as table start reliance on historical trends that may not accurately predict future events including assumptions underlying the models and estimations which predict correlation among certain market indicators or asset prices table endtable start inherent limitations associated with forecasting uncertain economic and financial outcomes table endtable start historical trend information may

or algorithms and table endtable start review processes may fail to detect flaws in models and estimations table end some of the models and other analytical and judgmentbased estimations used by jpmorgan chase in managing risks are subject to review by and require the approval of jpmorgan chases regulators these reviews are required before jpmorgan chase may use those models and estimations in connection with calculating market risk rwa credit risk rwa and operational risk rwa under basel iii if jpmorgan chases models or estimations are not approved by its regulators it may be subject to higher capital charges which could adversely affect its financial results or limit the ability to expand its businesses jpmorgan chases capital actions could also be constrained if a ccar submission is not approved by its banking regulators due to the perceived inadequacy of its models or estimations enhanced regulatory and other standards for the oversight of vendors and other service providers can result in higher costs and other potential exposures jpmorgan chase must comply with enhanced regulatory and other standards associated with doing business with vendors and other service providers including standards relating to the outsourcing of functions as well as the performance of significant banking and other functions by subsidiaries jpmorgan chase incurs significant costs and table start table end part i expenses in connection with its initiatives to address the risks associated with oversight of its internal and external service providers jpmorgan chases failure to

lower revenues and the opportunity cost from lost revenues table endtable start increased operational costs or table endtable start harm to jpmorgan chases reputation table end jpmorgan chase could incur unexpected losses if estimates and judgments underlying its financial statements are incorrect under us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap jpmorgan chase is required to use estimates and apply judgments in preparing its financial statements including in determining the allowance for credit losses and reserves related to litigation certain financial instruments require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare jpmorgan chases financial statements including table start trading assets and liabilities table endtable start instruments in the investment portfolio table endtable start certain loans table endtable start msrs table endtable start structured notes and table endtable start certain repurchase and resale agreements table end where quoted market prices are not available for these types of financial instruments jpmorgan chase may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management estimates and judgment and these types of estimates and judgments may not prove to be accurate due to a variety of factors as noted above in addition sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain financial instruments which could lead to valuations being subsequently changed or adjusted if estimates or judgments underlying jpmorgan chases financial statements prove to have been incorrect jpmorgan chase may experience material losses jpmorgan chase establishes an allowance for expected credit losses that are inherent in its credit exposures it then employs stress testing and other techniques to determine the amounts of capital and liquidity that would be needed in the event of adverse economic or market events these processes are critical to jpmorgan chases results of operations and financial condition they require difficult subjective and complex judgments including forecasts of how economic conditions might impair the ability of jpmorgan chases borrowers and counterparties to repay their loans or other obligations it is possible that jpmorgan chase will fail to identify the proper factors or that it will fail to accurately estimate the impact of factors that it identifies lapses in controls over disclosure or financial reporting could materially affect jpmorgan chases profitability or reputation there can be no assurance that jpmorgan chases disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in every circumstance or that a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting will not occur any such lapses or deficiencies could table start materially and adversely affect jpmorgan chases business and

lapses or deficiencies table endtable start expose it to litigation or regulatory fines penalties or other sanctions table endtable start harm its reputation or table endtable start otherwise diminish investor confidence in jpmorgan chase table end jpmorgan chase could be adversely affected by changes in accounting standards or policies the preparation of jpmorgan chases financial statements is based on accounting standards established by the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission as well as more detailed accounting policies established by jpmorgan chases management from time to time these accounting standards or accounting policies may change and in some cases these changes could have a significant effect on jpmorgan chases financial statements and may adversely affect its financial results or investor perceptions of those results as of january jpmorgan chase has implemented a new accounting standard commonly referred to as the current expected credit losses cecl framework which requires earlier recognition of expected credit losses on loans and certain other instruments the allowance for credit losses related to jpmorgan chases loans and other lendingrelated commitments increased as a result of the implementation of cecl which has a negative impact on jpmorgan chases capital levels the ongoing impact of the adoption of cecl could include the following each of which could result in diminished investor confidence table start greater volatility in jpmorgan chases earnings and capital levels over economic cycles table end table start table end table start potential reductions in its capital distributions or table endtable start unexpected increases in the allowance for credit losses table end in addition jpmorgan chase could be adversely impacted by associated changes in the competitive environment in which it operates including changes in the availability or pricing of loan products particularly during periods of economic stress as well as changes related to nonus financial institutions or other competitors that are not subject to this accounting standard strategic if jpmorgan chases management fails to develop and execute effective business strategies and to anticipate changes affecting those strategies jpmorgan chases competitive standing and results could suffer jpmorgan chases business strategies significantly affect its competitive standing and operations these strategies relate to table start the products and services that jpmorgan chase offers table endtable start the geographies in which it operates table endtable start the types of clients and customers that it serves table endtable start the counterparties with which it does business and table endtable start the methods and distribution channels by which it offers products and services table end if management makes choices about these strategies and goals that prove to be incorrect do not accurately assess the competitive landscape and industry trends or fail to address changing regulatory and market environments then the franchise values and growth prospects of jpmorgan chases businesses may suffer and its earnings could decline jpmorgan chases growth prospects also depend on managements ability to develop and execute effective business plans to address these strategic priorities both in the near term and over longer time horizons managements effectiveness in this regard will affect jpmorgan chases ability to develop and enhance its resources control expenses and return capital to shareholders each of these objectives could be adversely affected by any failure on the part of management to table start devise effective business plans and strategies table endtable start offer products and services that meet changing expectations of clients and customers table endtable start allocate capital in a manner that promotes longterm stability to enable jpmorgan chase to build and invest in

allocations table endtable start appropriately address shareholder concerns table end table start react quickly to changes in market conditions or market structures or table endtable start develop and enhance the operational technology risk financial and managerial resources necessary to grow and manage jpmorgan chases businesses table end additionally jpmorgan chases board of directors plays an important role in exercising appropriate oversight of managements significant strategic decisions and a failure by the board to perform this function could also impair jpmorgan chases results of

and proceedings either by multiple federal state or local agencies and officials in the us or in some instances regulators and other governmental officials in nonus jurisdictions if another financial institution violates a law or regulation relating to a particular business activity or practice this will often give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same
