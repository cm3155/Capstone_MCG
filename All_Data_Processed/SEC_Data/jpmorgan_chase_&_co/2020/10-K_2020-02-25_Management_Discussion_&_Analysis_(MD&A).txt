show that exposure will decline after the first year if no new trades are added to the portfolio exposure profile of derivatives measures december in billions managements discussion and analysis avg these measures all incorporate netting and collateral benefits where applicable peak represents a conservative measure of potential exposure to a counterparty calculated in a manner that is broadly equivalent to a confidence level over the life of the transaction peak is the primary measure used by the firm for setting credit limits for derivative contracts senior management reporting and derivatives exposure management dre exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of derivative exposure on a basis intended to be equivalent to the risk of loan exposures dre is a less extreme measure of potential credit loss than peak and is used as an input for aggregating derivative credit risk exposures with loans and other credit risk finally avg is a measure of the expected fair value of the firms derivative receivables at future time periods including the benefit of collateral avg over the total life of the derivative contract is used as the primary metric for pricing purposes and is used to calculate credit risk capital and cva as further described below the fair value of the firms derivative receivables incorporates cva to reflect the credit quality of counterparties cva is based on the firms avg to a counterparty and the counterpartys credit spread in the credit derivatives market the firm believes that active risk management is essential to controlling the dynamic credit risk in the derivatives portfolio in addition the firms risk management process takes into consideration the potential impact of wrongway risk which is broadly defined as the potential for

not representative in the firms view of the true changes in value of the firms overall credit exposure the effectiveness of credit default swaps cds as a hedge against the firms exposures may vary depending on a number of factors including the named reference entity ie the firm may experience losses on specific exposures that are different than the named reference entities in the purchased cds the contractual terms of the cds which may have a defined credit event that does not align with an actual loss realized by the firm and the maturity of the firms cds protection which in some cases may be shorter than the firms exposures however the firm generally seeks to purchase credit protection with a maturity date that is the same or similar to the maturity date of the exposure for which the

risk measure to estimate the potential loss from adverse market moves in the current market environment the firm has a single var framework used as a basis for calculating risk management var and regulatory var the framework is employed across the firm using historical simulation based on data for the previous months the frameworks approach assumes that historical changes in market values are representative of the distribution of potential outcomes in the immediate future the firm believes the use of risk management var provides a daily measure of risk that is closely aligned to risk management decisions made by the lobs and corporate and along with other market risk measures provides the appropriate information needed to respond to risk events the firms risk management var is calculated assuming a oneday holding period and an expected tailloss methodology which approximates a confidence level risk management var provides a consistent framework to measure risk profiles and levels of diversification across product types and is used for aggregating risks and monitoring limits across businesses var results are reported to senior management the board of directors and regulators under the firms risk management var methodology assuming current changes in market values are consistent with the historical changes used in the simulation the firm would expect to incur var backtesting exceptions defined as losses greater than that predicted by var estimates an average of five times every trading days the number of var backtesting exceptions observed can differ from the statistically expected number of backtesting exceptions if the current level of market volatility is materially different from the level of market volatility during the months of historical data used in the var calculation underlying the overall var model framework are individual var models that simulate historical market returns for individual risk factors andor product types to capture material market risks as part of the firms risk management framework comprehensive var model calculations are performed daily for businesses whose activities give rise to market risk these var models are granular and incorporate numerous risk factors and inputs to simulate daily changes in market values over the historical period inputs are selected based on the risk profile of each portfolio as sensitivities and historical time series used to generate daily market values may be different across product types or risk management systems the var model results across all portfolios are aggregated at the firm level as var is based on historical data it is an imperfect measure of market risk exposure and potential future losses in addition based on their reliance on available historical data limited time horizons and other factors var measures are inherently limited in their ability to measure certain risks and to predict losses particularly those associated with market illiquidity and sudden or severe shifts in market conditions for certain products specific risk parameters are not captured in var due to the lack of inherent liquidity and availability of appropriate historical data the firm uses proxies to estimate the var for these and other products when daily time series are not available it is likely that using an actual pricebased time series for these products if available would affect the var results presented the firm therefore considers other nonstatistical measures such as stress testing in addition to var to capture and manage its market risk positions the daily market data used in var models may be different than the independent thirdparty data collected for vcg price testing in its monthly valuation process for example in cases where market prices are not observable or where proxies are used in var historical time series the data sources may differ refer to valuation process in note for further information on the firms valuation process as var model calculations require daily data and a consistent source for valuation it may not be practical to use the data collected in the vcg monthly valuation process for var model calculations the firms var model calculations are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the firms portfolios changes in market conditions improvements in the firms modeling techniques and measurements and other factors such changes may affect historical comparisons of var results refer to estimations and model risk management on page for information regarding model reviews and approvals the firm calculates separately a daily aggregated var in accordance with regulatory rules regulatory var which is used to derive the firms regulatory varbased capital requirements under basel iii this regulatory var model framework currently assumes a ten businessday holding period and an expected tail loss methodology which approximates a confidence level regulatory var is applied to covered positions as defined by basel iii which may be different than the positions included in the firms risk management var for example credit derivative hedges of accrual loans are included in the firms risk management var while regulatory var excludes these credit derivative hedges in addition in contrast to the firms risk management var regulatory var currently excludes the diversification benefit for certain var models jpmorgan chase co2019 form 10k managements discussion and analysis refer to jpmorgan chases basel iii pillar regulatory capital

changes in markets using recent historical market behavior stress testing reflects the risk of loss from hypothetical changes in the value of market risk sensitive positions applied simultaneously stress testing measures the firms vulnerability to losses under a range of stressed but possible economic and market scenarios the results are used to understand the exposures responsible for those potential losses and are measured against limits the firms stress framework covers corporate and all lobs with market risk sensitive positions the framework is used to calculate multiple magnitudes of potential stress for both market rallies and market selloffs assuming significant changes in market factors such as credit spreads equity prices interest rates currency rates and commodity prices and combines them in multiple ways to capture an array of hypothetical economic and market scenarios the firm generates a number of scenarios that focus on tail events in specific asset classes and geographies including how the event may impact multiple market factors simultaneously scenarios also incorporate specific idiosyncratic risks and stress basis risk between different products the flexibility in the stress framework allows the firm to construct new scenarios that can test the outcomes against possible future stress events stress testing results are reported on a regular basis to senior management of the firm as appropriate stress scenarios are governed by an overall stress framework and are subject to the standards outlined in the firms policies related to model risk management significant changes to the framework are reviewed as appropriate the firms stress testing framework is utilized in calculating the firms ccar and other stress test results which are reported to the board of directors in addition stress testing results are incorporated into the firms risk appetite framework and are reported periodically to the board risk committee profit and loss drawdowns profit and loss drawdowns are used to highlight trading losses above certain levels of risk tolerance a profit and loss drawdown is a decline in revenue from its yeartodate peak level earningsatrisk the effect of interest rate exposure on the firms reported net income is important as interest rate risk represents one of the firms significant market risks interest rate risk arises not only from trading activities but also from the firms traditional banking activities which include extension of loans and credit facilities taking deposits and issuing debt as well as from the investment securities portfolio refer to the table on page for a summary by lob and corporate identifying positions included in earningsatrisk the ctc risk committee establishes the firms structural interest rate risk policy and related limits which are subject to approval by the board risk committee treasury and cio working in partnership with the lobs calculates the firms structural interest rate risk profile and reviews it with senior management including the ctc risk committee in addition oversight of structural interest rate risk is managed through a dedicated risk function reporting to the ctc this risk function is responsible for providing independent oversight and governance around assumptions and establishing and monitoring limits for structural interest rate risk the firm manages structural interest rate risk generally through its investment securities portfolio and interest rate derivatives structural interest rate risk can occur due to a variety of factors including differences in timing among the maturity or repricing of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments differences in the amounts of assets liabilities and off balance sheet instruments that are maturing or repricing at the same time differences in the amounts by which shortterm and long term market interest rates change for example changes in the slope of the yield curve the impact of changes in the maturity of various assets liabilities or offbalance sheet instruments as interest rates change the firm manages interest rate exposure related to its assets and liabilities on a consolidated firmwide basis business units transfer their interest rate risk to treasury and cio through funds transfer pricing which takes into account the elements of interest rate exposure that can be riskmanaged in financial markets these elements include asset and liability balances and contractual rates of interest contractual principal payment schedules expected prepayment experience interest rate reset dates and maturities rate indices used for repricing and any interest rate ceilings or floors for adjustable rate products all transferpricing assumptions are dynamically reviewed

compared to december reflected updates to the firms baseline for lower short term and longterm rates as well as the impact of changes in the firms balance sheet the firms sensitivity to short term rates reflected updates to the firms baseline for lower rates but changes in the firms balance sheet more than offset the impacts of the lower rates the firms sensitivity to longterm rates increased as a result of updates to the firms baseline to reflect lower rates in addition to changes in the firms balance sheet the increased sensitivity to longterm rates is more impactful to the downward

interest rate exposure for a given interest rate scenario it is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline which includes net interest income and certain interest rate sensitive fees the baseline uses market interest rates and in the case of deposits pricing assumptions the firm conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest ratesensitive assets and liabilities denominated in us

hedges and exclude other positions in risk management var and other sensitivitybased measures as described on page earningsatrisk scenarios estimate the potential change to a net interest income baseline over the following months utilizing multiple assumptions these scenarios include a parallel shift involving changes to both shortterm and longterm rates by an equal amount a steeper yield curve involving holding shortterm rates constant and increasing longterm rates or decreasing shortterm rates and holding longterm rates constant and a flatter yield curve involving increasing shortterm rates and holding longterm rates constant or holding shortterm rates constant and decreasing longterm rates these scenarios consider many different factors including the impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous changes in interest rates from baseline rates forecasted balance sheet as well as modeled prepayment and reinvestment behavior but do not include assumptions about actions that could be taken by the firm in response to any such instantaneous rate changes mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates the time since origination and other factors which are updated periodically based on historical experience the pricing sensitivity of deposits using normalized deposit betas which represent the amount by which deposit rates paid could change upon a given change in market interest rates over the cycle the deposit rates paid in these scenarios differ from actual deposit rates

adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused estimation outputs the firm uses models and other analytical and judgment based estimations across various businesses and functions the estimation methods are of varying levels of sophistication and are used for many purposes such as the valuation of positions and measurement of risk assessing regulatory capital requirements conducting stress testing and making business decisions a dedicated independent function model risk governance and review mrgr defines and governs the firms policies relating to the management of model risk and risks associated with certain analytical and judgmentbased estimations such as those used in risk management budget forecasting and capital planning and analysis the governance of analytical and judgmentbased estimations within mrgrs scope follows a consistent approach to the approach used for models which is described in detail below model risks are owned by the users of the models within the firm based on the specific purposes of such models users and developers of models are responsible for developing implementing and testing their models as well as referring models to the model risk function for review and approval once models have been approved model users and developers are responsible for maintaining a robust operating environment and must monitor and evaluate the performance of the models on an ongoing basis model users and developers may seek to enhance models in response to changes in the portfolios and in product and market developments as well as to capture improvements in available modeling techniques and systems capabilities models are tiered based on an internal standard according to their complexity the exposure associated with the model and the firms reliance on the model this tiering is subject to the approval of the model risk function in its review of a model the model risk function considers whether the model is suitable for the specific purposes for which it will be used when reviewing a model the model risk function analyzes and challenges the model methodology and the reasonableness of model assumptions and may perform or require additional testing including backtesting of model outcomes model reviews are approved by the appropriate level of management within the model risk function based on the relevant model tier under the firms estimations and model risk management policy the model risk function reviews and approves new models as well as material changes to existing models prior to implementation in the operating environment in certain circumstances exceptions may be granted to the firms policy to allow a model to be used prior to review or approval the model risk function may also require the user to take appropriate actions to mitigate the model risk if it is to be used in the interim these actions will depend on the model and may include for example limitation of trading activity refer to critical accounting estimates used by the firm on pages and note for a summary of modelbased valuations and other valuation techniques jpmorgan chase co2019 form 10k managements discussion and analysis critical accounting estimates used by the firm jpmorgan chases accounting policies and use of estimates are integral to understanding its reported results the firms most complex accounting estimates require managements judgment to ascertain the appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities the firm has established policies and control procedures intended to ensure that estimation methods including any judgments made as part of such methods are wellcontrolled independently reviewed and applied consistently from period to period the methods used and judgments made reflect among other factors the nature of the assets or liabilities and the related business and risk management strategies which may vary across the firms businesses and portfolios in addition the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner the firm believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of its assets and liabilities are appropriate the following is a brief description of the firms critical accounting estimates involving significant judgments allowance for credit losses the firms allowance for credit losses covers the retained consumer and wholesale loan portfolios as well as the firms wholesale and certain consumer lendingrelated commitments the allowance for loan losses is intended to adjust the carrying value of the firms loans to reflect probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date similarly the allowance for lending related commitments is established to cover probable credit losses inherent in the lendingrelated commitments portfolio as of the balance sheet date the allowance for credit losses includes a formulabased component an assetspecific component and a component related to pci loans the determination of each of these components involves significant judgment on a number of matters refer to allowance for credit losses on pages and note for further information on these components areas of judgment and methodologies used in establishing the firms allowance for credit losses allowance for credit losses sensitivity the firms allowance for credit losses is sensitive to numerous factors which may differ depending on the portfolio changes in economic conditions or in the firms assumptions and estimates could affect its estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date the firm uses its best judgment to assess these economic conditions and loss data in estimating the allowance for credit losses and these estimates are subject to periodic refinement based on changes to underlying external or firmspecific historical data refer to note for further discussion to illustrate the potential magnitude of certain alternate judgments the firm estimates that changes in the following inputs would have the following effects on the firms modeled credit loss estimates as of december without consideration of any offsetting or correlated effects of other inputs in the firms allowance for loan losses a combined decline in housing prices and a basis point increase in unemployment rates from expectations could imply an increase to modeled credit loss estimates of approximately million for pci loans an increase to modeled annual credit loss estimates of approximately million for residential real estate loans excluding pci loans for credit card loans a basis point increase in unemployment rates from expectations could imply an increase to modeled annual credit loss estimates of approximately million an increase in probability of default pd factors consistent with a onenotch downgrade in the firms internal risk ratings for its entire wholesale loan portfolio could imply an increase in the firms modeled credit loss estimates of approximately billion a basis point increase in estimated loss given default lgd for the firms entire wholesale loan portfolio could imply an increase in the firms modeled credit loss estimates of approximately million the purpose of these sensitivity analyses is to provide an indication of the isolated impacts of hypothetical alternative assumptions on modeled loss estimates the changes in the inputs presented above are not intended to imply managements expectation of future deterioration of those risk factors in addition these analyses are not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance for loan losses which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled loss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled loss estimates based on thencurrent circumstances and conditions it is difficult to estimate how potential changes in specific factors might affect the overall allowance for credit losses because management considers a variety of factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit losses changes in these factors and inputs may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types and changes in factors may be directionally inconsistent such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in other factors in addition it is difficult to predict how changes in specific economic conditions or assumptions could affect borrower behavior or other factors considered by management in estimating the allowance for credit losses given the process the firm follows and the judgments made in evaluating the risk factors related to its loss estimates management believes that its current estimate of the allowance for credit losses is appropriate fair value jpmorgan chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value the majority of such assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis including derivatives and structured note products certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis including certain mortgage home equity and other jpmorgan chase co2019 form 10k loans where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral assets measured at fair value the following table includes the firms assets measured at fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified within level of the valuation hierarchy refer to note for further information december in billions except ratios total assets at fair value total level assets trading debt and equity instruments derivative receivablesa trading assets afs securities loans msrs other total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis total assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis total assets measured at fair value total firm assets level assets as a percentage of total firm assetsa level assets as a percentage of total firm assets at fair valuea a for purposes of the table above the derivative receivables total reflects the impact of netting adjustments however the billion of derivative receivables classified as level does not reflect the netting adjustment as such netting is not relevant to a presentation based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset the level balances would be reduced if netting were applied including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral valuation details of the firms processes for determining fair value are set out in note estimating fair value requires the application of judgment the type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the firm for instruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level of the valuation hierarchy judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels and in arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level management must first determine the appropriate valuation technique to use second the lack of observability of certain significant inputs requires management to assess all relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including for example transaction details yield curves interest rates prepayment rates default rates volatilities correlations equity or debt prices valuations of comparable instruments foreign exchange rates and credit curves refer to note for a further discussion of the valuation of level instruments including unobservable inputs used for instruments classified in levels and management judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality the firms creditworthiness market funding rates liquidity considerations unobservable parameters and for portfolios that meet specified criteria the size of the net open risk position the judgments made are typically affected by the type of product and its specific contractual terms and the level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a whole refer to note for a further discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the firm imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position furthermore while the firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the firms businesses and portfolios the firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value the use of methodologies or assumptions different than those used by the firm could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date refer to note for a detailed discussion of the firms valuation process and hierarchy and its determination of fair value for individual financial instruments goodwill impairment under us gaap goodwill must be allocated to reporting units and tested for impairment at least annually the firms process and methodology used to conduct goodwill impairment testing is described in note management applies significant judgment when testing goodwill for impairment the goodwill associated with each business combination is allocated to the related reporting units for goodwill impairment testing for the year ended december the firm reviewed current economic conditions estimated market cost of equity as well as actual and projections of business performance for all its businesses based upon such reviews the firm concluded that the goodwill allocated to its reporting units was not impaired as of december the fair values of these reporting units exceeded their carrying values by approximately or higher and did not indicate a significant risk of goodwill impairment based on current projections and valuations the projections for all of the firms reporting units are consistent with managements current shortterm business outlook assumptions and in the longer term incorporate a set of macroeconomic assumptions and the firms best estimates of longterm growth and returns on equity of its businesses where possible the firm uses thirdparty and peer data to benchmark its assumptions and estimates refer to note for additional information on goodwill including the goodwill impairment assessment as of december credit card rewards liability jpmorgan chase offers credit cards with various rewards programs which allow cardholders to earn rewards points based on their account activity and the terms and conditions of the rewards program generally there are no limits on the points that an eligible cardholder can earn nor jpmorgan chase co2019 form 10k that a deferred tax asset is not realizable a valuation allowance is established the valuation allowance may be reversed in a subsequent reporting period if the firm determines that based on revised estimates of future taxable income or changes in tax planning strategies it is more likely than not that all or part of the deferred tax asset will become realizable as of december management has determined it is more likely than not that the firm will realize its deferred tax assets net of the existing valuation allowance the firm adjusts its unrecognized tax benefits as necessary when additional information becomes available uncertain tax positions that meet the morelikelythannot recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize an uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that management believes is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement it is possible that the reassessment of jpmorgan chases unrecognized tax benefits may have a material impact on its effective income tax rate in the period in which the reassessment occurs refer to note for additional information on income taxes litigation reserves refer to note for a description of the significant estimates and judgments associated with establishing litigation reserves managements discussion and analysis do the points expire and the points can be redeemed for a variety of rewards including cash predominantly in the form of account credits gift cards and travel the firm maintains a rewards liability which represents the estimated cost of rewards points earned and expected to be redeemed by cardholders the rewards liability is sensitive to various assumptions including cost per point and redemption rates for each of the various rewards programs which are evaluated periodically the liability is accrued as the cardholder earns the benefit and is reduced when the cardholder redeems points this liability was billion and billion at december and respectively and is recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets income taxes jpmorgan chase is subject to the income tax laws of the various jurisdictions in which it operates including us federal state and local and nonus jurisdictions these laws are often complex and may be subject to different interpretations to determine the financial statement impact of accounting for income taxes including the provision for income tax expense and unrecognized tax benefits jpmorgan chase must make assumptions and judgments about how to interpret and apply these complex tax laws to numerous transactions and business events as well as make judgments regarding the timing of when certain items may affect taxable income in the us and nonus tax jurisdictions jpmorgan chases interpretations of tax laws around the world are subject to review and examination by the various taxing authorities in the jurisdictions where the firm operates and disputes may occur regarding its view on a tax position these disputes over interpretations with the various taxing authorities may be settled by audit administrative appeals or adjudication in the court systems of the tax jurisdictions in which the firm operates jpmorgan chase regularly reviews whether it may be assessed additional income taxes as a result of the resolution of these matters and the firm records additional reserves as appropriate in addition the firm may revise its estimate of income taxes due to changes in income tax laws legal interpretations and business strategies it is possible that revisions in the firms estimate of income taxes may materially affect the firms results of operations in any reporting period the firms provision for income taxes is composed of current and deferred taxes deferred taxes arise from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting versus income tax return purposes deferred tax assets are recognized if in managements judgment their realizability is determined to be more likely than not the firm has also recognized deferred tax assets in connection with certain tax attributes including net operating loss nol carryforwards and foreign tax credit ftc carryforwards the firm performs regular reviews to ascertain whether its deferred tax assets are realizable these reviews include managements estimates and assumptions regarding future taxable income which also incorporates various tax planning strategies including strategies that may be available to utilize nols before they expire in connection with these reviews if it is determined jpmorgan chase co2019 form 10k accounting and reporting developments financial accounting standards board fasb standards adopted during

sheets as a lease liability with a corresponding rightofuse asset requires lessees and lessors to classify most leases using principles similar to existing lease accounting but eliminates the bright line classification tests expands qualitative and quantitative leasing disclosures the firm elected the available practical expedient to not reassess whether existing contracts contain a lease or whether classification or unamortized initial lease costs would be different under the new lease guidance the firm elected the modified retrospective transition method through a cumulativeeffect

adopted as of december standard summary of guidance financial instruments credit losses cecl issued june establishes a single allowance framework for all financial assets carried at amortized cost and certain offbalance sheet credit exposures this framework requires that managements estimate reflects credit losses over the full remaining expected life and considers expected future changes in macroeconomic conditions eliminates existing guidance for pci loans and requires recognition of the nonaccretable difference as an increase to the allowance for expected credit losses on financial assets purchased with more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination with a corresponding increase in the recorded investment of the related loans requires inclusion of expected recoveries limited to the cumulative amount of prior write offs when estimating the allowance for credit losses for in scope financial assets including collateral dependent assets amends existing impairment guidance for afs securities to incorporate an allowance which will allow for reversals of credit impairments in the event that the credit of an issuer improves requires a cumulativeeffect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the reporting period of adoption effects on financial statements adopted january the adoption of this guidance resulted in a net increase to the allowance for credit losses of billion and a decrease to retained earnings of billion primarily driven by card under the cecl framework the firm estimates losses over a twoyear forecast period using the weightedaverage of a range of macroeconomic scenarios established on a firmwide basis and then reverts to longer term historical loss experience to estimate losses over more extended periods the firm elected to phasein the impact to retained earnings of billion to regulatory capital at percent per year in each of to cecl transitional period based on the firms capital as of december the estimated impact to the standardized cet1 capital ratio will be a reduction of approximately bps for each transitional year as permitted by the guidance the firm elected the fair value option for certain securities financing agreements the difference between their carrying amount and fair value was immaterial and was recorded as part of the firms cumulativeeffect adjustment refer to note for further information goodwill issued january requires recognition of an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of a reporting unit falls below its carrying value eliminates the requirement that an impairment loss be recognized only if the estimated implied fair value of the goodwill is below its carrying value adopted january no impact upon adoption as the guidance is to be applied
