entirety to the discussion of the risk factors set forth below covid19 pandemic ongoing effects of the covid19 pandemic could harm the global economy and negatively affect jpmorgan chases businesses on march the world health organization declared the outbreak of a strain of novel coronavirus disease covid19 to be a global pandemic the covid19 pandemic and governmental responses to the pandemic which included the institution of social distancing and shelterinplace requirements in certain areas of the us and other countries resulted in adverse impacts on global economic conditions including significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets significant disruption of global supply chains and closures of many businesses leading to loss of revenues and increased unemployment the adverse economic conditions caused by the pandemic have had a negative impact on certain of jpmorgan chases businesses and results of operations including reduction in demand for certain products and services from jpmorgan chases clients and customers resulting in lower revenue and increases in the allowance for credit losses during the early stages of the pandemic although global economic conditions have been improving despite the continuation of the covid19 pandemic any ongoing negative economic impacts arising from the pandemic or any prolongation or worsening of the pandemic including as a result of additional waves or variants of the covid19 disease or the emergence of other diseases that have similar outcomes could have significant adverse effects on jpmorgan chases businesses results of operations and financial condition including recognition of chargeoffs and increases in the allowance for credit losses including any delayed recognition of chargeoffs due to the impact of government stimulus actions or payment assistance provided to clients and customers material impacts on the value of securities derivatives and other financial instruments which jpmorgan chase owns or in which it makes markets downgrades in jpmorgan chases credit ratings constraints on liquidity or capital due to elevated levels of deposits increases in riskweighted assets rwa related to supporting client activities downgrades in client credit ratings regulatory actions or other factors any or all of which could require jpmorgan chase to take or refrain from taking actions that it otherwise would under its liquidity and capital management strategies and the possibility that significant portions of jpmorgan chases workforce are unable to work effectively including because of illness quarantines shelterinplace arrangements government actions or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic the extent to which the covid19 pandemic negatively affects jpmorgan chases businesses results of operations and financial condition as well as its regulatory capital and liquidity ratios will depend on future developments that are uncertain and cannot be fully predicted including the ultimate scope and duration of the pandemic the effectiveness and acceptance of vaccines and their availability in certain regions actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic and the effect that the pandemic or any prolongation or worsening of the pandemic may have on the pace of economic growth inflation the strength of labor markets particularly in light of the expiration of government assistance programs and the potential for changes in consumer table start table end behavior that could have longerterm impacts on certain economic sectors in addition jpmorgan chases participation in us government programs designed to support individuals households and businesses impacted by the economic disruptions caused by the covid19 pandemic whether directly or indirectly including on behalf of customers and clients or by affiliated entities newlyacquired businesses or companies in which jpmorgan chase has made principal investments could be criticized and subject jpmorgan chase to increased governmental and regulatory scrutiny negative publicity and increased exposure to litigation any or all of which could increase jpmorgan chases operational legal and compliance costs and damage its reputation to the extent that the covid19 pandemic adversely affects jpmorgan chases business results of operations and financial condition it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described below regulatory jpmorgan chases businesses are highly regulated and the laws rules and regulations that apply to jpmorgan chase have a significant impact on its business and operations jpmorgan chase is a financial services firm with operations worldwide jpmorgan chase must comply with the laws rules and regulations that apply to its operations in all of the jurisdictions around the world in which it does business regulation of the financial services industry is extensive the regulation and supervision of financial services firms has expanded significantly over an extended period of time the increased regulation and supervision of jpmorgan chase has affected the way that it conducts its business and structures its operations jpmorgan chase could be required to make further changes to its business and operations in response to expanded supervision or to new or changed laws rules and regulations these types of developments could result in jpmorgan chase incurring additional costs in connection with complying with applicable laws rules and regulations which could reduce its profitability furthermore jpmorgan chases entry into or acquisition of a new business or an increase in its principal investments may require jpmorgan chase to comply with additional laws rules and regulations in response to new and existing laws rules and regulations and expanded supervision jpmorgan chase has in the past been and could in the future be required to limit the products and services that it offers reduce the liquidity that it can provide through its marketmaking activities refrain from engaging in business opportunities that it might otherwise pursue pay higher taxes assessments levies or other governmental charges including in connection with the resolution of tax examinations incur losses with respect to fraudulent transactions perpetrated against its customers dispose of certain assets and do so at times or prices that are disadvantageous impose restrictions on certain business activities or increase the prices that it charges for products and services which could reduce the demand for them in particular jpmorgan chases businesses and results of operations could be adversely impacted by changes in laws rules and regulations or changes in the application interpretation or enforcement of laws rules and regulations that proscribe or institute more stringent restrictions on certain financial services activities impose new requirements relating to the impact of business activities on environmental social and governance esg concerns the management of risks associated with those concerns and the offering of products intended to achieve esgrelated objectives or introduce changes to antitrust or anticompetition laws rules and regulations that adversely affect the business activities of jpmorgan chase differences in financial services regulation can be disadvantageous for jpmorgan chases businesses the content and application of laws rules and regulations affecting financial services firms sometimes vary according to factors such as the size of the firm the jurisdiction in which it is organized or operates and other criteria for example larger firms such as jpmorgan chase are often subject to more stringent supervision and regulation financial technology companies and other nontraditional competitors may not be subject to banking regulation or may be supervised by a national or state regulatory agency that does not have the same resources or regulatory priorities as the regulatory agencies which supervise more diversified financial services firms or the financial services regulatory framework in a particular jurisdiction may favor financial institutions that are based in that jurisdiction these types of differences in the regulatory framework can result in jpmorgan chase losing market share to competitors that are less regulated or not subject to regulation especially with respect to unregulated financial products table start table end part i there can also be significant differences in the ways that similar regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry are implemented in the us and in other countries and regions in which jpmorgan chase does business for example when adopting rules that are intended to implement a global regulatory standard a national regulator may introduce additional or more restrictive requirements which can create competitive disadvantages for financial services firms such as jpmorgan chase that may be subject to those enhanced regulations legislative and regulatory initiatives outside the us could require jpmorgan chase to make significant modifications to its operations and legal entity structure in the relevant countries or regions in order to comply with those requirements these include laws rules and regulations that have been adopted or proposed relating to the establishment of locallybased intermediate holding companies or operating subsidiaries requirements to maintain minimum amounts of capital or liquidity in locallybased subsidiaries the separation or ring fencing of core banking products and services from markets activities the resolution of financial institutions requirements for executing or settling transactions on exchanges or through central counterparties ccps position limits and reporting rules for derivatives governance and accountability regimes conduct of business and control requirements and restrictions on compensation these types of differences inconsistencies and conflicts in financial services regulation have required and could in the future require jpmorgan chase to divest assets or restructure its operations absorb increased operational capital and liquidity costs change the prices that it charges for its products and services curtail the products and services that it offers to its customers and clients curtail other business opportunities including acquisitions or principal investments that it otherwise would have pursued or incur higher costs for complying with different legal and regulatory frameworks any or all of these factors could harm jpmorgan chases ability to compete against other firms that are not subject to the same laws rules and regulations or supervisory oversight or harm jpmorgan chases businesses results of operations and profitability resolving regulatory investigations can subject jpmorgan chase to significant penalties and collateral consequences and could result in higher compliance costs or restrictions on its operations jpmorgan chases operations are subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny from regulatory authorities in many jurisdictions jpmorgan chase has paid significant fines provided other monetary relief incurred other penalties and experienced other repercussions in connection with resolving investigations and enforcement actions by governmental agencies jpmorgan chase could become subject to similar regulatory resolutions or other actions in the future and addressing the requirements of any such resolutions or actions could result in jpmorgan chase incurring higher operational and compliance costs including devoting substantial resources to the required remediation or needing to comply with other restrictions in connection with resolving specific regulatory investigations or enforcement actions certain regulators have required jpmorgan chase and other financial institutions to admit wrongdoing with respect to the activities that gave rise to the resolution these types of admissions can lead to greater exposure in litigation damage to reputation disqualification from doing business with certain clients or customers or in specific jurisdictions or other direct and indirect adverse effects furthermore us government officials have demonstrated a willingness to bring criminal actions against financial institutions and have required that institutions plead guilty to criminal offenses or admit other wrongdoing in connection with resolving regulatory investigations or enforcement actions resolutions of this type can have significant collateral consequences for the subject financial institution including loss of clients customers and business restrictions on offering certain products or services and losing permission to operate certain businesses either temporarily or permanently jpmorgan chase expects that it and other financial services firms will continue to be subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and governmental investigations and enforcement actions regulators will continue to require that financial institutions be penalized for actual or deemed violations of law with formal and punitive enforcement actions including the imposition of significant monetary and other sanctions rather than resolving these matters through informal supervisory actions and table start table end regulators will be more likely to pursue formal enforcement actions and resolutions against jpmorgan chase to the extent that it has previously been subject to other governmental investigations or enforcement actions if jpmorgan chase fails to meet the requirements of any resolution of a governmental investigation or enforcement action or to maintain risk and control processes that meet the heightened standards and expectations of its regulators it could be required to among other things enter into further resolutions of investigations or enforcement actions pay additional regulatory penalties or enter into judgments or accept material regulatory restrictions on or changes in the management of its businesses in these circumstances jpmorgan chase could also become subject to other sanctions or to prosecution or civil litigation with respect to the conduct that gave rise to an investigation or enforcement action jpmorgan chase can face greater risks of noncompliance and incur higher operational and compliance costs under laws rules and regulations relating to antimoney laundering economic sanctions embargo programs and anticorruption jpmorgan chase must comply with laws rules and regulations throughout the world relating to antimoney laundering economic sanctions embargo programs and anticorruption which can increase its risks of noncompliance and costs associated with the implementation and maintenance of complex compliance programs a violation of any of these legal and regulatory requirements could subject jpmorgan chase or individual employees to regulatory enforcement actions as well as significant civil and criminal penalties in addition certain national and multinational bodies and governmental agencies outside the us have adopted laws rules or regulations that conflict with or prohibit a firm such as jpmorgan chase from complying with laws rules and regulations to which it is otherwise subject creating conflict of law issues that also increase its risks of noncompliance in those jurisdictions jpmorgan chases operations and financial results can be negatively impacted in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory frameworks jpmorgan chase conducts existing and new business in certain countries in which the application of the rule of law is inconsistent or less predictable including with respect to the absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or guidance for engaging in specific types of business or transactions conflicting or ambiguous laws rules and regulations or the inconsistent application or interpretation of existing laws rules and regulations uncertainty concerning the enforceability of contractual intellectual property or other obligations difficulty in competing in economies in which the government controls or protects all or a portion of the local economy or specific businesses or where graft or corruption may be pervasive and the threat of arbitrary regulatory investigations civil litigations or criminal prosecutions the termination of licenses required to operate in the local market or the suspension of business relationships with governmental bodies if the application of the laws rules and regulations in a particular country is susceptible to producing inconsistent or unexpected outcomes this can create a more difficult environment in which jpmorgan chase conducts its business and could negatively affect jpmorgan chases operations and reduce its earnings with respect to that country for example conducting business could require jpmorgan chase to devote significant additional resources to understanding and monitoring changes in local laws rules and regulations as well as structuring its operations to comply with local laws rules and regulations and implementing and administering related internal policies and procedures there can be no assurance that jpmorgan chase will always be successful in its efforts to fully understand and to conduct its business in compliance with the laws rules and regulations of all of the jurisdictions in which it operates and the risk of noncompliance can be greater in countries that have less predictable legal and regulatory systems requirements for the orderly resolution of jpmorgan chase could result in jpmorgan chase having to restructure or reorganize its businesses and could increase its funding or operational costs or curtail its businesses jpmorgan chase is required under federal reserve and fdic rules to prepare and submit periodically to those agencies a detailed plan for rapid and orderly resolution in bankruptcy without extraordinary government support in the event of material financial distress or failure the agencies evaluation of jpmorgan chases resolution plan may change and the requirements for resolution plans may be modified from time to time any such determinations or modifications could result in jpmorgan chase needing to make changes to its legal entity structure or to certain internal or external activities which could increase its funding or operational costs or hamper its ability to serve clients and customers if the federal reserve and the fdic were both to determine that a resolution plan submitted by jpmorgan chase has deficiencies they could jointly impose more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on jpmorgan chases growth activities or operations the agencies could also require that jpmorgan chase restructure reorganize or divest assets or businesses in table start table end part i ways that could materially and adversely affect jpmorgan chases operations and strategy holders of jpmorgan chase cos debt and equity securities will absorb losses if it were to enter into a resolution federal reserve rules require that jpmorgan chase co the parent company maintain minimum levels of unsecured external longterm debt and other lossabsorbing capacity with specific terms eligible ltd for purposes of recapitalizing jpmorgan chases operating subsidiaries if the parent company were to enter into a resolution either in a bankruptcy proceeding under chapter of the us bankruptcy code or in a receivership administered by the fdic under title ii of the doddfrank act title ii if the parent company were to enter into a resolution holders of eligible ltd and other debt and equity securities of the parent company will absorb the losses of the parent company and its subsidiaries the preferred single point of entry strategy under jpmorgan chases resolution plan contemplates that only the parent company would enter bankruptcy proceedings jpmorgan chases subsidiaries would be recapitalized as needed so that they could continue normal operations or subsequently be divested or wound down in an orderly manner as a result the parent companys losses and any losses incurred by its subsidiaries would be imposed first on holders of the parent companys equity securities and thereafter on its unsecured creditors including holders of eligible ltd and other debt securities claims of holders of those securities would have a junior position to the claims of creditors of jpmorgan chases subsidiaries and to the claims of priority as determined by statute and secured creditors of the parent company accordingly in a resolution of the parent company in bankruptcy holders of eligible ltd and other debt securities of the parent company would realize value only to the extent available to the parent company as a shareholder of jpmorgan chase bank na and its other subsidiaries and only after any claims of priority and secured creditors of the parent company have been fully repaid the fdic has similarly indicated that a single point of entry recapitalization model could be a desirable strategy to resolve a systemically important financial institution such as the parent company under title ii however the fdic has not formally adopted a single point of entry resolution strategy if the parent company were to approach or enter into a resolution none of the parent company the federal reserve or the fdic is obligated to follow jpmorgan chases preferred resolution strategy and losses to holders of eligible ltd and other debt and equity securities of the parent company under whatever strategy is ultimately followed could be greater than they might have been under jpmorgan chases preferred strategy political economic uncertainty or instability caused by political developments can negatively impact jpmorgan chases businesses political developments in the us and other countries can cause uncertainty in the economic environment and market conditions in which jpmorgan chase operates its businesses certain monetary fiscal and other policy initiatives and proposals could significantly affect us and global economic growth and cause higher volatility in the financial markets including monetary policies and actions taken by the federal reserve and other central banks or governmental authorities including any sustained largescale asset purchases or any suspension or reversal of those actions fiscal policies including with respect to taxation and spending actions that governments take or fail to take in response to the effects of the covid19 pandemic as well as the effectiveness of any actions taken isolationist foreign policies an outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other geopolitical instabilities economic sanctions the implementation of tariffs and other protectionist trade policies or other governmental policies or actions adopted or taken in response to political or social pressures these types of political developments and uncertainty about the possible outcomes of these developments could erode investor confidence in the us economy and financial markets which could potentially undermine the status of the us dollar as a safe haven currency provoke retaliatory countermeasures by other countries and otherwise heighten tensions in diplomatic relations lead to the withdrawal of government support for agencies and enterprises such as the us federal national mortgage association and the us federal home loan mortgage corporation together the us gses increase concerns about whether the us government will be funded and its outstanding debt serviced at any particular time result in periodic shutdowns of the us government or governments in other countries table start table end increase investor reliance on actions by the federal reserve or other central banks or influence investor perceptions concerning government support of sectors of the economy or the economy as a whole adversely affect the financial condition or credit ratings of clients and counterparties with which jpmorgan chase does business or cause jpmorgan chase to refrain from engaging in business opportunities that it might otherwise pursue these factors could lead to slower growth rates rising inflation or recession greater market volatility a contraction of available credit and the widening of credit spreads erosion of adequate risk premium on certain financial assets diminished investor and consumer confidence lower investment growth largescale sales of government debt and other debt and equity securities in the us and other countries reduced commercial activity among trading partners the potential for a currency redenomination by a particular country the possible departure of a country from or the dissolution of a political or economic alliance or treaty potential expropriation or nationalization of assets or other market dislocations including the spread of unfavorable economic conditions from a particular country or region to other countries or regions any of these potential outcomes could cause jpmorgan chase to suffer losses on its marketmaking positions or in its investment portfolio reduce its liquidity and capital levels increase credit risk hamper its ability to deliver products and services to its clients and customers and weaken its results of operations and financial condition market economic and market events and conditions can materially affect jpmorgan chases businesses and investment and marketmaking positions jpmorgan chases results of operations can be negatively affected by adverse changes in any of the following investor consumer and business sentiment events that reduce confidence in the financial markets inflation or deflation high unemployment or conversely a tightening labor market the availability and cost of capital liquidity and credit levels and volatility of interest rates credit spreads and market prices for currencies equities and commodities and the duration of any changes in levels or volatility the economic effects of an outbreak or escalation of hostilities terrorism or other geopolitical instabilities cyber attacks climate change natural disasters severe weather conditions health emergencies the spread of infectious diseases epidemics or pandemics or other extraordinary events beyond jpmorgan chases control and the health of the us and global economies all of these are affected by global economic market and political events and conditions as well as regulatory restrictions in addition jpmorgan chases investment portfolio and marketmaking businesses can suffer losses due to unanticipated market events including severe declines in asset values unexpected credit events unforeseen events or conditions that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated and vice versa the inability to effectively hedge market and other risks related to marketmaking and investment portfolio positions or other market risks that may not have been appropriately taken into account in the development structuring or pricing of a financial instrument if jpmorgan chase experiences significant losses in its investment portfolio or from marketmaking activities this could reduce jpmorgan chases profitability and its liquidity and capital levels and thereby constrain the growth of its businesses jpmorgan chases consumer businesses can be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions and governmental policies jpmorgan chases consumer businesses are particularly affected by us and global economic conditions including personal and household income distribution unemployment or underemployment prolonged periods of exceptionally low interest rates housing prices the level of inflation and its effect on prices for goods and services consumer and small business confidence levels and changes in consumer spending or in the level of consumer debt table start table end part i heightened levels of unemployment or underemployment that result in reduced personal and household income could negatively affect consumer credit performance to the extent that consumers are less able to service their debts in addition sustained low growth low or negative interest rates inflationary pressures or recessionary conditions could diminish customer demand for the products and services offered by jpmorgan chases consumer businesses adverse economic conditions could also lead to an increase in delinquencies additions to the allowance for credit losses and higher net chargeoffs which can reduce jpmorgan chases earnings these consequences could be significantly worse in certain geographies and industry segments where declining industrial or manufacturing activity has resulted in or could result in higher levels of unemployment or where high levels of consumer debt such as outstanding student loans could impair the ability of customers to pay their other consumer loan obligations jpmorgan chases earnings from its consumer businesses could also be adversely affected by governmental policies and actions that affect consumers including policies and initiatives relating to medical insurance education immigration employment status and housing and policies aimed at the economy more broadly such as higher taxes and increased regulation which could result in reductions in consumer disposable income in addition governmental proposals to permit student loan obligations to be discharged in bankruptcy proceedings could if enacted into law encourage certain of jpmorgan chases customers to declare personal bankruptcy and thereby trigger defaults and chargeoffs of credit card and other consumer loans extended to those customers unfavorable market and economic conditions can have an adverse effect on jpmorgan chases wholesale businesses in jpmorgan chases wholesale businesses market and economic factors can affect the volume of transactions that jpmorgan chase executes for its clients or for which it advises clients and therefore the revenue that jpmorgan chase receives from those transactions these factors can also influence the willingness of other financial institutions and investors to participate in capital markets transactions that jpmorgan chase manages such as loan syndications or securities underwritings furthermore if a significant and sustained deterioration in market conditions were to occur the profitability of jpmorgan chases capital markets businesses including its loan syndication securities underwriting and leveraged lending activities could be reduced to the extent that those businesses earn less fee revenue due to lower transaction volumes including when clients are unwilling or unable to refinance their outstanding debt obligations in unfavorable market conditions or dispose of portions of credit commitments at a loss or hold larger residual positions in credit commitments that cannot be sold at favorable prices an adverse change in market conditions in particular segments of the economy such as a sudden and severe downturn in oil and gas prices or an increase in commodity prices or sustained changes in consumer behavior that affect specific economic sectors could have a material adverse effect on clients of jpmorgan chase whose operations or financial condition are directly or indirectly dependent on the health or stability of those market segments or economic sectors as well as clients that are engaged in related businesses jpmorgan chase could incur losses on its loans and other credit commitments to clients that operate in or are dependent on any sector of the economy that is under stress the fees that jpmorgan chase earns from managing client assets or holding assets under custody for clients could be diminished by declining asset values or other adverse macroeconomic conditions for example higher interest rates or a downturn in financial markets could affect the valuations of client assets that jpmorgan chase manages or holds under custody which in turn could affect jpmorgan chases revenue from fees that are based on the amount of assets under management or custody similarly adverse macroeconomic or market conditions could prompt outflows from jpmorgan chase funds or accounts or cause clients to invest in products that generate lower revenue substantial and unexpected withdrawals from a jpmorgan chase fund can also hamper the investment performance of the fund particularly if the outflows create the need for the fund to dispose of fund assets at disadvantageous times or prices and could lead to further withdrawals based on the weaker investment performance an economic downturn or sustained changes in consumer behavior that results in shifts in consumer and business spending could also have a negative impact on certain of jpmorgan chases wholesale clients and thereby diminish jpmorgan chases earnings from its wholesale operations for example the businesses of certain of jpmorgan chases wholesale clients are dependent on consistent streams of rental income from commercial real estate properties which are owned or being built by those clients sustained adverse economic conditions could result in reductions in the rental cash flows that owners or developers receive from their tenants which in turn could depress the values of the properties and impair the ability of borrowers to service or refinance their commercial real estate loans these consequences could result in jpmorgan chase experiencing increases in the allowance for credit losses higher delinquencies defaults and chargeoffs within its commercial real estate loan portfolio and incurring higher costs for servicing a larger volume of delinquent loans in that portfolio thereby reducing jpmorgan chases earnings from its wholesale businesses table start table end changes in interest rates and credit spreads can adversely affect certain of jpmorgan chases revenue and income streams related to its traditional banking and funding activities in general a low or negative interest rate environment may cause net interest margins to be compressed which could reduce the amounts that jpmorgan chase earns on its investment securities portfolio to the extent that it is unable to reinvest contemporaneously in higheryielding instruments unanticipated or adverse changes in depositor behavior which could negatively affect jpmorgan chases broader asset and liability management strategy jpmorgan chase to reduce the amount of deposits that it accepts from customers and clients which could result in lower revenues and a reduction in the value of jpmorgan chases mortgage servicing rights msrs asset thereby decreasing revenues when credit spreads widen it becomes more expensive for jpmorgan chase to borrow jpmorgan chases credit spreads may widen or narrow not only in response to events and circumstances that are specific to jpmorgan chase but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical events and conditions changes in jpmorgan chases credit spreads will affect positively or negatively jpmorgan chases earnings on certain liabilities such as derivatives that are recorded at fair value when interest rates are increasing jpmorgan chase can generally be expected to earn higher net interest income however higher interest rates can also lead to fewer originations of commercial and residential real estate loans losses on underwriting exposures the loss of deposits including in the event that jpmorgan chase makes incorrect assumptions about depositor behavior unrealized marktomarket losses on availableforsale afs securities held in the investment securities portfolio lower net interest income if central banks introduce interest rate increases more quickly than anticipated and this results in a misalignment in the pricing of shortterm and longterm borrowings less liquidity in the financial markets and higher funding costs all of these outcomes could adversely affect jpmorgan chases earnings or its liquidity and capital levels higher interest rates can also negatively affect the payment performance on loans within jpmorgan chases consumer and wholesale loan portfolios that are linked to variable interest rates if borrowers of variable rate loans are unable to afford higher interest payments those borrowers may reduce or stop making payments thereby causing jpmorgan chase to incur losses and increased operational costs related to servicing a higher volume of delinquent loans jpmorgan chases results may be materially affected by market fluctuations and significant changes in the value of financial instruments the value of securities derivatives and other financial instruments which jpmorgan chase owns or in which it makes markets can be materially affected by market fluctuations market volatility illiquid market conditions and other disruptions in the financial markets may make it extremely difficult to value certain financial instruments subsequent valuations of financial instruments in future periods in light of factors then prevailing may result in significant changes in the value of these instruments in addition at the time of any disposition of these financial instruments the price that jpmorgan chase ultimately realizes will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their current fair value any of these factors could cause a decline in the value of financial instruments that jpmorgan chase owns or in which it makes markets which may have an adverse effect on jpmorgan chases results of operations jpmorgan chases risk management and monitoring processes including its stress testing framework seek to quantify and control jpmorgan chases exposure to more extreme market moves however jpmorgan chases hedging and other risk management strategies may not be effective and it could incur significant losses if extreme market events were to occur credit jpmorgan chase can be negatively affected by adverse changes in the financial condition of clients counterparties custodians and ccps jpmorgan chase routinely executes transactions with clients and counterparties such as corporations financial institutions asset managers hedge funds securities exchanges and government entities within and outside the us many of these transactions expose jpmorgan chase to the credit risk of its clients and counterparties and can involve jpmorgan chase in disputes and litigation if a client or counterparty defaults jpmorgan chase can also be subject to losses or liability where a financial institution that it has appointed to provide custodial services for client assets or funds becomes insolvent as a result of fraud or the failure to abide by existing laws and obligations a default by or the financial or operational failure of a ccp through which jpmorgan chase executes contracts would require jpmorgan chase to replace those contracts thereby table start table end part i increasing its operational costs and potentially resulting in losses in addition jpmorgan chase can be exposed to losses if a member of a ccp in which jpmorgan chase is also a member defaults on its obligations to the ccp because of requirements that each member of the ccp absorb a portion of those losses furthermore jpmorgan chase can be subject to bearing its share of nondefault losses incurred by a ccp including losses from custodial settlement or investment activities or due to cyber or other security breaches as part of its clearing services activities jpmorgan chase is exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its clients which it seeks to mitigate by requiring clients to provide adequate collateral jpmorgan chase is also exposed to intraday credit risk of its clients in connection with providing cash management clearing custodial and other transaction services to those clients if a client for which jpmorgan chase provides these services becomes bankrupt or insolvent jpmorgan chase may incur losses become involved in disputes and litigation with one or more ccps the clients bankruptcy estate and other creditors or be subject to regulatory investigations all of the foregoing events can increase jpmorgan chases operational and litigation costs and jpmorgan chase may suffer losses to the extent that any collateral that it has received is insufficient to cover those losses transactions with government entities including national state provincial municipal and local authorities can expose jpmorgan chase to enhanced sovereign credit operational and reputation risks government entities may among other things claim that actions taken by government officials were beyond the legal authority of those officials or repudiate transactions authorized by a previous incumbent government these types of actions have in the past caused and could in the future cause jpmorgan chase to suffer losses or hamper its ability to conduct business in the relevant jurisdiction in addition local laws rules and regulations could limit jpmorgan chases ability to resolve disputes and litigation in the event of a counterparty default or unwillingness to make previously agreedupon payments which could subject jpmorgan chase to losses disputes may arise with counterparties to derivatives contracts with regard to the terms the settlement procedures or the value of underlying collateral the disposition of those disputes could cause jpmorgan chase to incur unexpected transaction operational and legal costs or result in credit losses these consequences can also impair jpmorgan chases ability to effectively manage its credit risk exposure from its market activities or cause harm to jpmorgan chases reputation the financial or operational failure of a significant market participant such as a major financial institution or a ccp or concerns about the creditworthiness of such a market participant can have a cascading effect within the financial markets jpmorgan chases businesses could be significantly disrupted by such an event particularly if it leads to other market participants incurring significant losses experiencing liquidity issues or defaulting and jpmorgan chase is likely to have significant interrelationships with and credit exposure to such a significant market participant jpmorgan chase may suffer losses if the value of collateral declines in stressed market conditions during periods of market stress or illiquidity jpmorgan chases credit risk may be further increased when jpmorgan chase fails to realize the fair value of the collateral it holds collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount owed to it or counterparties are unable to post collateral whether for operational or other reasons furthermore disputes with counterparties concerning the valuation of collateral may increase in times of significant market stress volatility or illiquidity and jpmorgan chase could suffer losses during these periods if it is unable to realize the fair value of collateral or to manage declines in the value of collateral jpmorgan chase could incur significant losses arising from concentrations of credit and market risk jpmorgan chase is exposed to greater credit and market risk to the extent that groupings of its clients or counterparties engage in similar or related businesses or in businesses in related industries do business in the same geographic region or have business profiles models or strategies that could cause their ability to meet their obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions for example a significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of jpmorgan chases borrowers or counterparties could lead to concerns about the creditworthiness of other borrowers or counterparties in similar related or dependent industries this type of interrelationship could exacerbate jpmorgan chases credit liquidity and market risk exposure and potentially cause it to incur losses including fair value losses in its marketmaking businesses and investment portfolios in addition jpmorgan chase may be required to increase the allowance for credit losses with respect to certain clients or industries in order to align with directives or expectations of its banking regulators similarly challenging economic conditions that affect a particular industry or geographic area could lead to concerns about the credit quality of jpmorgan chases borrowers or counterparties not only in that particular industry or geography but in related or dependent industries wherever located these conditions could also heighten concerns about the ability of customers of table start table end jpmorgan chases consumer businesses who live in those areas or work in those affected industries or related or dependent industries to meet their obligations to jpmorgan chase jpmorgan chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit and market risk exposures to assess the potential risks of concentration or contagion but its efforts to diversify or hedge its exposures against those risks may not be successful jpmorgan chases consumer businesses can also be harmed by an excessive expansion of consumer credit by bank or nonbank competitors heightened competition for certain types of consumer loans could prompt industrywide reactions such as significant reductions in the pricing or margins of those loans or the making of loans to lesscreditworthy borrowers if large numbers of consumers subsequently default on their loans whether due to weak credit profiles an economic downturn or other factors this could impair their ability to repay obligations owed to jpmorgan chase and result in higher chargeoffs and other creditrelated losses more broadly widespread defaults on consumer debt could lead to recessionary conditions in the us economy and jpmorgan chases consumer businesses may earn lower revenues in such an environment if jpmorgan chase is unable to reduce positions effectively during a market dislocation this can increase both the market and credit risks associated with those positions and the level of rwa that jpmorgan chase holds on its balance sheet these factors could adversely affect jpmorgan chases capital position funding costs and the profitability of its businesses liquidity jpmorgan chases ability to operate its businesses could be impaired if its liquidity is constrained jpmorgan chases liquidity could be impaired at any given time by factors such as marketwide illiquidity or disruption unforeseen liquidity or capital requirements including as a result of changes in laws rules and regulations inability to sell assets or to sell assets at favorable times or prices default by a ccp or other significant market participant unanticipated outflows of cash or collateral unexpected loss of consumer deposits or higher than anticipated draws on lendingrelated commitments and lack of market or customer confidence in jpmorgan chase or financial institutions in general a reduction in jpmorgan chases liquidity may be caused by events over which it has little or no control for example during periods of market stress low investor confidence and significant market illiquidity could result in higher funding costs for jpmorgan chase and could limit its access to some of its traditional sources of liquidity jpmorgan chase may need to raise funding from alternative sources if its access to stable and lowercost sources of funding such as deposits and borrowings from federal home loan banks is reduced alternative sources of funding could be more expensive or limited in availability jpmorgan chases funding costs could also be negatively affected by actions that jpmorgan chase may take in order to satisfy applicable liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio requirements address obligations under its resolution plan or satisfy regulatory requirements in jurisdictions outside the us relating to the prepositioning of liquidity in subsidiaries that are material legal entities more generally if jpmorgan chase fails to effectively manage its liquidity this could constrain its ability to fund or invest in its businesses and subsidiaries and thereby adversely affect its results of operations jpmorgan chase co is a holding company and depends on the cash flows of its subsidiaries to make payments on its outstanding securities jpmorgan chase co is a holding company that holds the stock of jpmorgan chase bank na and an intermediate holding company jpmorgan chase holdings llc the ihc the ihc in turn generally holds the stock of jpmorgan chases subsidiaries other than jpmorgan chase bank na and its subsidiaries the ihc also owns other assets and provides intercompany lending to the holding company the holding company is obligated to contribute to the ihc substantially all the net proceeds received from securities issuances including issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common stock the ability of jpmorgan chase bank na and the ihc to make payments to the holding company is also limited jpmorgan chase bank na is subject to regulatory restrictions on its dividend distributions as well as capital adequacy requirements such as the supplementary leverage ratio slr and liquidity requirements and other regulatory restrictions on its ability to make payments to the holding company the ihc is prohibited from paying dividends or extending credit to the holding company if certain capital or liquidity thresholds are breached or if limits are otherwise imposed by jpmorgan chases management or board of directors as a result of these arrangements the ability of the holding company to make various payments is dependent on its receiving dividends from jpmorgan chase bank na and dividends and borrowings from the ihc these limitations could affect the holding companys ability to pay interest on its debt securities table start table end part i pay dividends on its equity securities redeem or repurchase outstanding securities and fulfill its other payment obligations these arrangements could also result in the holding company seeking protection under bankruptcy laws or otherwise entering into resolution proceedings at a time earlier than would have been the case absent the existence of the capital and liquidity thresholds to which the ihc is subject reductions in jpmorgan chases credit ratings may adversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding jpmorgan chase co and certain of its principal subsidiaries are rated by credit rating agencies rating agencies evaluate both general and firmspecific and industryspecific factors when determining credit ratings for a particular financial institution including expected future profitability risk management practices legal expenses ratings differentials between bank holding companies and their bank and nonbank subsidiaries regulatory developments assumptions about government support and economic and geopolitical developments jpmorgan chase closely monitors and manages to the extent that it is able factors that could influence its credit ratings however there is no assurance that jpmorgan chases credit ratings will not be lowered in the future furthermore any such downgrade could occur at times of broader market instability when jpmorgan chases options for responding to events may be more limited and general investor confidence is low a reduction in jpmorgan chases credit ratings could curtail jpmorgan chases business activities and reduce its profitability in a number of ways including reducing its access to capital markets materially increasing its cost of issuing and servicing securities triggering additional collateral or funding requirements and decreasing the number of investors and counterparties that are willing or permitted to do business with or lend to jpmorgan chase any rating reduction could also increase the credit spreads charged by the market for taking credit risk on jpmorgan chase co and its subsidiaries this could in turn adversely affect the value of debt and other obligations of jpmorgan chase co and its subsidiaries the reform and replacement of benchmark rates could adversely affect financial instruments issued funded serviced or held by jpmorgan chase and expose it to litigation and other disputes interest rate equity foreign exchange rate and other types of indices which are deemed to be benchmarks including those in widespread and longstanding use have been the subject of ongoing international national and other regulatory scrutiny and initiatives for reform including changes to the rules and methodologies under which certain benchmarks are administered initiatives designed to discourage or prohibit the use of certain benchmarks by market participants the introduction of alternative reference rates to be used by market participants in lieu of certain benchmarks and legislative proposals and actions providing for the replacement of reference rates under existing contracts and instruments that are linked to certain benchmarks with alternative reference rates some of these reforms are already effective while others are still to be implemented or are under consideration these and other reforms relating to benchmarks could cause certain benchmarks to be substantially modified or to be permanently discontinued lead to disruptions in the financial markets including in connection with the transition to alternative reference rates give rise to litigation and other disputes cause reputational harm to the extent that operational and technology systems are not sufficiently prepared for the transition to alternative reference rates or have other consequences which cannot be fully anticipated any of these developments and any future initiatives to regulate reform or change the administration of benchmarks could result in adverse consequences to the return on value of and market for loans mortgages securities derivatives and other financial instruments whose returns are linked to any such benchmark including those issued funded serviced or held by jpmorgan chase changes in the manner in which certain benchmarks are administered or the general increased regulatory scrutiny of those benchmarks could increase the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of those benchmarks and complying with regulations or requirements relating to those benchmarks such factors may have the effect of discouraging market participants from continuing to administer or contribute to certain benchmarks trigger further changes in the rules or methodologies under which certain benchmarks are table start table end administered or lead to the discontinuation of certain benchmarks regulators industry bodies and other market participants in the us and other countries continue to engage in initiatives to develop introduce and encourage the use of alternative reference rates to replace certain benchmarks and certain of these alternative rates have gained or are gaining acceptance among market participants however there is no assurance that any of these new rates will be similar to or produce the economic equivalent of the benchmarks that they seek to replace arrangements by market participants to prepare for the discontinuation of certain benchmarks and the transition to alternative reference rates will be fully effective or a particular alternative reference rate will be widely accepted by market participants or that market acceptance of that rate will not be hindered by the introduction of other reference rates if a particular benchmark were to be discontinued and an alternative reference rate has not been successfully introduced or widely accepted within the market this could result in significant adverse effects on the financial markets for example vast amounts of loans mortgages securities derivatives and other financial instruments are linked to the london interbank offered rate libor benchmark ice benchmark administration the administrator of libor has announced that the publication of the principal tenors of us dollar libor will cease after june and significant progress has been made by regulators industry bodies and market participants to introduce and implement the secured overnight financing rate sofr as a replacement rate for us dollar libor however if an alternative reference rate such as sofr has not achieved sufficient market acceptance when the publication of the principal tenors of us dollar libor is discontinued or if market participants have not otherwise implemented effective transitional arrangements to address that discontinuation this could result in widespread dislocation in the financial markets volatility in the pricing of securities derivatives and other instruments and the suppression of capital markets activities all of which could have a negative impact on jpmorgan chases results of operations and on us dollar liborlinked securities credit or other instruments which are issued funded serviced or held by jpmorgan chase jpmorgan chase could also become involved in litigation and other types of disputes with clients customers counterparties and investors as a consequence of the transition from us dollar libor and other benchmark rates to replacement rates including claims that jpmorgan chase has treated clients customers counterparties or investors unfairly or caused them to experience losses higher financing costs or lower returns on investments failed to appropriately communicate the effects of the transition from benchmark rates on the products that jpmorgan chase has sold to its clients and customers or failed to disclose purported conflicts of interest made inappropriate product recommendations to or investments on behalf of its clients or sold products that did not serve their intended purpose in connection with the transition from benchmark rates engaged in anticompetitive behavior or in the manipulation of markets or specific benchmarks in connection with the discontinuation of or transition from benchmark rates or disadvantaged clients customers counterparties or investors when interpreting or making determinations under the terms of agreements or financial instruments these types of claims could subject jpmorgan chase to higher legal expenses and operational costs require it to pay significant amounts in connection with resolving litigation and other disputes and harm its reputation capital maintaining the required level and composition of capital may impact jpmorgan chases ability to support business activities meet evolving regulatory requirements and distribute capital to shareholders jpmorgan chase is subject to various regulatory capital requirements including leverage and riskbased capital requirements in addition as a globally systemically important bank gsib jpmorgan chase is required to hold additional capital buffers including a gsib surcharge a scb and a countercyclical buffer each of which is reassessed at least annually the amount of capital that jpmorgan chase is required to hold in order to satisfy these leverageand riskbased requirements could increase at any given time due to factors such as actions by banking regulators including changes in laws rules and regulations actions taken by the federal reserve or the us government in response to the economic effects of systemic events such as the actions taken in response to the covid19 pandemic which led to an expansion of the federal reserve balance sheet growth in deposits held by jpmorgan chase and other us financial institutions and consequently an increase in leverage exposure and the gsib surcharge changes in the composition of jpmorgan chases balance sheet or developments that could increase risk weighted assets such as increased market risk customer delinquencies client credit rating downgrades or other factors and table start table end part i increases in estimated stress losses as determined by the federal reserve under the comprehensive capital analysis and review which could increase jpmorgan chases scb any failure by or inability of jpmorgan chase to maintain the required level and composition of capital or unfavorable changes in applicable capital requirements could have an adverse impact on jpmorgan chases shareholders such as reducing the amount of common stock that jpmorgan chase is permitted to repurchase requiring the issuance of or prohibiting the redemption of capital instruments in a manner inconsistent with jpmorgan chases capital management strategy constraining the amount of dividends that may be paid on common stock or curtailing jpmorgan chases business activities or operations operational jpmorgan chases businesses are dependent on the effectiveness of its operational systems and those of other market participants jpmorgan chases businesses rely on the ability of jpmorgan chases financial accounting transaction execution data processing and other operational systems to process record monitor and report a large number of transactions on a continuous basis and to do so accurately quickly and securely in addition to proper design installation maintenance and training the effective functioning of jpmorgan chases operational systems depends on the quality of the information contained in those systems as inaccurate outdated or corrupted data can significantly compromise the functionality or reliability of a particular system and other systems to which it transmits or from which it receives information and the ability of jpmorgan chase to appropriately maintain and upgrade its systems on a regular basis and to ensure that any changes introduced to its systems are managed carefully to ensure security and operational continuity and adhere to all applicable legal and regulatory requirements jpmorgan chase also depends on its ability to access and use the operational systems of its vendors custodians and other market participants including clearing and payment systems ccps securities exchanges and data processing security and technology companies including those that provide cloud computing services the ineffectiveness failure or other disruption of operational systems upon which jpmorgan chase depends including due to a systems malfunction cyberbreach or other systems failure could result in unfavorable ripple effects in the financial markets and for jpmorgan chase and its clients and customers including delays or other disruptions in providing services liquidity or information to clients and customers the inability to settle transactions or obtain access to funds and other assets including those for which physical settlement and delivery is required failure to timely settle or confirm transactions the possibility that funds transfers capital markets trades or other transactions are executed erroneously as a result of illegal conduct or with unintended consequences financial losses including due to losssharing requirements of ccps payment systems or other market infrastructures or as possible restitution to clients and customers higher operational costs associated with replacing services provided by a system that is unavailable client or customer dissatisfaction with jpmorgan chases products and services regulatory fines penalties or other sanctions against jpmorgan chase loss of confidence in the ability of jpmorgan chase or financial institutions generally to protect against and withstand operational disruptions or harm to jpmorgan chases reputation as the speed frequency volume interconnectivity and complexity of transactions continue to increase it can become more challenging to effectively maintain and upgrade jpmorgan chases operational systems and infrastructure especially due to the heightened risks that attempts by third parties to defraud jpmorgan chase or its clients and customers may increase evolve or become more complex particularly during periods of market disruption or economic uncertainty errors made by jpmorgan chase or another market participant whether inadvertent or malicious cause widespread system disruption isolated or seemingly insignificant errors in operational systems compound or migrate to other systems over time to become larger issues failures in synchronization or encryption software or degraded performance of microprocessors could cause disruptions in operational systems or the inability of systems to communicate with each other and third parties may attempt to block the use of key technology solutions by claiming that the use infringes on their intellectual property rights if jpmorgan chases operational systems or those of newlyacquired businesses or of external parties on which table start table end jpmorgan chases businesses depend are unable to meet the requirements of jpmorgan chases businesses and operations or bank regulatory standards or if they fail or have other significant shortcomings jpmorgan chase could be materially and adversely affected a successful cyber attack affecting jpmorgan chase could cause significant harm to jpmorgan chase and its clients and customers jpmorgan chase experiences numerous attempted cyber attacks on its computer systems software networks and other technology assets on a daily basis from various actors including groups acting on behalf of hostile countries cybercriminals hacktivists ie individuals or groups that use technology to promote a political agenda or social change and others these cyber attacks can take many forms including attempts to introduce computer viruses or malicious code which are commonly referred to as malware into jpmorgan chases systems these attacks are often designed to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information belonging to jpmorgan chase or its clients customers counterparties or employees manipulate data destroy data or systems with the aim of rendering services unavailable disrupt sabotage or degrade service on jpmorgan chases systems steal money or extort money through the use of socalled ransomware jpmorgan chase has also experienced significant distributed denialofservice attacks which are intended to disrupt online banking services jpmorgan chase has experienced security breaches due to cyber attacks in the past and it is inevitable that additional breaches will occur in the future any such breach could result in serious and harmful consequences for jpmorgan chase or its clients and customers a principal reason that jpmorgan chase cannot provide absolute security against cyber attacks is that it may not always be possible to anticipate detect or recognize threats to jpmorgan chases systems or to implement effective preventive measures against all breaches this is because the techniques used in cyber attacks change frequently and are increasingly sophisticated and therefore may not be recognized until launched cyber attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources including jpmorgan chases own employees cybercriminals hacktivists groups linked to terrorist organizations or hostile countries or third parties whose objective is to disrupt the operations of financial institutions more generally jpmorgan chase does not have control over the cybersecurity of the systems of the large number of clients customers counterparties and thirdparty service providers with which it does business and it is possible that a third party after establishing a foothold on an internal network without being detected might obtain access to other networks and systems the risk of a security breach due to a cyber attack could increase in the future due to factors such as jpmorgan chases ongoing expansion of its mobile banking and other internetbased product offerings and its internal use of internetbased products and applications including those that use cloud computing services the acquisition of new businesses and the increased use of remote access and third party video conferencing solutions to facilitate workfromhome arrangements for employees in addition a third party could misappropriate confidential information obtained by intercepting signals or communications from mobile devices used by jpmorgan chases employees a successful penetration or circumvention of the security of jpmorgan chases systems or the systems of a vendor governmental body or another market participant could cause serious negative consequences including significant disruption of jpmorgan chases operations and those of its clients customers and counterparties including losing access to operational systems misappropriation of confidential information of jpmorgan chase or that of its clients customers counterparties employees or regulators disruption of or damage to jpmorgan chases systems and those of its clients customers and counterparties the inability or extended delays in the ability to fully recover and restore data that has been stolen manipulated or destroyed or the inability to prevent systems from processing fraudulent transactions violations by jpmorgan chase of applicable privacy and other laws financial loss to jpmorgan chase or to its clients customers counterparties or employees loss of confidence in jpmorgan chases cybersecurity and business resiliency measures dissatisfaction among jpmorgan chases clients customers or counterparties significant exposure to litigation and regulatory fines penalties or other sanctions and harm to jpmorgan chases reputation table start table end part i the extent of a particular cyber attack and the steps that jpmorgan chase may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear and it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed while such an investigation is ongoing jpmorgan chase may not necessarily know the full extent of the harm caused by the cyber attack and that damage may continue to spread these factors may inhibit jpmorgan chases ability to provide rapid full and reliable information about the cyber attack to its clients customers counterparties and regulators as well as the public furthermore it may not be clear how best to contain and remediate the harm caused by the cyber attack and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated any or all of these factors could further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack jpmorgan chase can be negatively affected if it fails to identify and address operational risks associated with the introduction of or changes to products services and delivery platforms when jpmorgan chase launches a new product or service introduces a new platform for the delivery or distribution of products or services including mobile connectivity electronic trading and cloud computing acquires or invests in a business or makes changes to an existing product service or delivery platform it may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from those changes or may fail to implement adequate controls to mitigate the risks associated with those changes any significant failure in this regard could diminish jpmorgan chases ability to operate one or more of its businesses or result in potential liability to clients counterparties and customers increased operating expenses higher litigation costs including regulatory fines penalties and other sanctions damage to jpmorgan chases reputation impairment of jpmorgan chases liquidity regulatory intervention or weaker competitive standing any of the foregoing consequences could materially and adversely affect jpmorgan chases businesses and results of operations jpmorgan chases operational costs and customer satisfaction could be adversely affected by the failure of an external operational system external operational systems with which jpmorgan is connected whether directly or indirectly can be sources of operational risk to jpmorgan chase jpmorgan chase may be exposed not only to a systems failure or cyber attack that may be experienced by a vendor or market infrastructure with which jpmorgan chase is directly connected but also to a systems breakdown or cyber attack involving another party to which such a vendor or infrastructure is connected similarly retailers data aggregators and other external parties with which jpmorgan chases customers do business can increase jpmorgan chases operational risk this is particularly the case where activities of customers or those parties are beyond jpmorgan chases security and control systems including through the use of the internet cloud computing services and personal smart phones and other mobile devices or services if an external party obtains access to customer account data on jpmorgan chases systems and that party experiences a cyberbreach of its own systems or misappropriates that data this could result in a variety of negative outcomes for jpmorgan chase and its clients and customers including heightened risk that external parties will be able to execute fraudulent transactions using jpmorgan chases systems losses from fraudulent transactions as well as potential liability for losses that exceed thresholds established in consumer protection laws rules and regulations increased operational costs to remediate the consequences of the external partys security breach and reputational harm arising from the perception that jpmorgan chases systems may not be secure as jpmorgan chases interconnectivity with clients customers and other external parties continues to expand jpmorgan chase increasingly faces the risk of operational failure or cyber attacks with respect to the systems of those parties security breaches affecting jpmorgan chases clients or customers or systems breakdowns or failures security breaches or human error or misconduct affecting other external parties may require jpmorgan chase to take steps to protect the integrity of its own operational systems or to safeguard confidential information including restricting the access of customers to their accounts these actions can increase jpmorgan chases operational costs and potentially diminish customer satisfaction and confidence in jpmorgan chase furthermore the widespread and expanding interconnectivity among financial institutions clearing banks ccps payment processors financial technology companies securities exchanges clearing houses and other financial market infrastructures increases the risk that the disruption of an operational system involving one institution or entity including due to a cyber attack may cause industrywide operational disruptions that could materially affect jpmorgan chases ability to conduct business table start table end jpmorgan chases operations rely on its ability and the ability of key external parties to maintain appropriatelystaffed workforces and on the competence trustworthiness health and safety of employees jpmorgan chases ability to operate its businesses efficiently and profitably to offer products and services that meet the expectations of its clients and customers and to maintain an effective risk management framework is highly dependent on its ability to staff its operations appropriately and on the competence integrity health and safety of its employees jpmorgan chase is similarly dependent on the workforces of other parties on which jpmorgan chases operations rely including vendors custodians and financial markets infrastructures jpmorgan chases businesses could be materially and adversely affected by the ineffective implementation of business decisions any failure to institute controls that appropriately address risks associated with business activities or to appropriately train employees with respect to those risks and controls staffing shortages particularly in tight labor markets a significant operational breakdown or failure theft fraud or other unlawful conduct or other negative outcomes caused by human error or misconduct by an employee of jpmorgan chase or of another party on which jpmorgan chases operations depend jpmorgan chases operations could also be impaired if the measures taken by it or by governmental authorities to help ensure the health and safety of its employees are ineffective or if any external party on which jpmorgan chase relies fails to take appropriate and effective actions to protect the health and safety of its employees jpmorgan chase faces substantial legal and operational risks in safeguarding personal information jpmorgan chases businesses are subject to complex and evolving laws rules and regulations both within and outside the us governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals the protected parties can include jpmorgan chases current prospective and former clients and customers clients and customers of jpmorgan chases clients and customers current prospective and former employees and employees of jpmorgan chases vendors counterparties and other external parties ensuring that jpmorgan chases collection use sharing and storage of personal information comply with all applicable laws rules and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions including where the laws of different jurisdictions are in conflict can increase jpmorgan chases compliance and operating costs hinder the development of new products or services curtail the offering of existing products or services or affect how products and services are offered to clients and customers demand significant oversight by jpmorgan chases management and require jpmorgan chase to structure its businesses operations and systems in less efficient ways not all of jpmorgan chases clients customers vendors counterparties and other external parties may have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information exchanged between them and jpmorgan chase particularly where information is transmitted by electronic means jpmorgan chase could be exposed to litigation or regulatory fines penalties or other sanctions if personal information of clients customers employees or others were to be mishandled or misused such as situations where such information is erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information or intercepted or otherwise compromised by unauthorized third parties concerns regarding the effectiveness of jpmorgan chases measures to safeguard personal information or even the perception that those measures are inadequate could cause jpmorgan chase to lose existing or potential clients and customers and thereby reduce jpmorgan chases revenues furthermore any failure or perceived failure by jpmorgan chase to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws rules and regulations may subject it to inquiries examinations and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices significant liabilities or regulatory fines penalties or other sanctions any of these could damage jpmorgan chases reputation and otherwise adversely affect its businesses in recent years wellpublicized incidents involving the inappropriate collection use sharing or storage of personal information have led to expanded governmental scrutiny of practices relating to the safeguarding of personal information by companies in the us and other countries that scrutiny has in some cases resulted in and could in the future lead to the adoption of stricter laws rules and regulations relating to the collection use sharing and storage of personal information these types of laws rules and regulations could prohibit or significantly restrict financial services firms such as jpmorgan chase from sharing information among affiliates or with third parties such as vendors and thereby increase compliance costs or could restrict jpmorgan chases use of personal data when developing or offering products or services to customers these restrictions could also inhibit jpmorgan chases table start table end part i development or marketing of certain products or services or increase the costs of offering them to customers jpmorgan chases operations results and reputation could be harmed by occurrences of extraordinary events beyond its control jpmorgan chases business and operational systems could be seriously disrupted and its reputation could be harmed by events or contributing factors that are wholly or partially beyond its control including material instances of cyber attacks security breaches of its physical premises including threats to health and safety power telecommunications or internet outages or shutdowns of mass transit failure of or loss of access to technology or operational systems including any resulting loss of critical data damage to or loss of property or assets of jpmorgan chase or third parties and any consequent injuries including in connection with any construction projects undertaken by jpmorgan chase effects of climate change natural disasters or severe weather conditions accidents such as explosions or structural failures health emergencies the spread of infectious diseases epidemics or pandemics or events arising from local or largerscale civil unrest any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or terrorist acts jpmorgan chase maintains a firmwide resiliency program that is intended to enable it to recover critical business functions and supporting assets including staff technology and facilities in the event of a business disruption including due to the occurrence of an extraordinary event beyond its control there can be no assurance that jpmorgan chases resiliency plans will fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks to jpmorgan chase its clients and customers and third parties with which it does business or that its resiliency plans will be adequate to address the effects of simultaneous occurrences of multiple business disruption events in addition jpmorgan chases ability to respond effectively to a business disruption event could be hampered to the extent that the members of its workforce physical assets or systems and other support infrastructure needed to address the event are geographically dispersed or conversely if such an event were to occur in an area in which they are concentrated further should extraordinary events or the factors that cause or contribute to those events become more chronic the disruptive effects of those events on jpmorgan chases business and operations and on its clients customers counterparties and employees could become more significant and longlasting any significant failure or disruption of jpmorgan chases operations or operational systems or the occurrence of one or more extraordinary events that are beyond its control could hinder jpmorgan chases ability to provide services to its clients and customers or to transact with its counterparties require it to expend significant resources to correct the failure or disruption or to address the event cause it to incur losses or liabilities including from loss of revenue damage to or loss of property or injuries disrupt market infrastructure systems on which jpmorgan chases businesses rely expose it to litigation or regulatory fines penalties or other sanctions and harm its reputation enhanced regulatory and other standards for the oversight of vendors and other service providers can result in higher costs and other potential exposures jpmorgan chase must comply with enhanced regulatory and other standards associated with doing business with vendors and other service providers including standards relating to the outsourcing of functions as well as the performance of significant banking and other functions by subsidiaries jpmorgan chase incurs significant costs and expenses in connection with its initiatives to address the risks associated with oversight of its internal and external service providers jpmorgan chases failure to appropriately assess and manage these relationships especially those involving significant banking functions shared services or other critical activities could materially adversely affect jpmorgan chase specifically any such failure could result in potential harm to clients and customers and any liability associated with that harm regulatory fines penalties or other sanctions lower revenues and the opportunity cost from lost revenues increased operational costs or harm to jpmorgan chases reputation jpmorgan chases risk management framework may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to jpmorgan chase any inadequacy or lapse in jpmorgan chases risk management framework governance structure practices models or reporting systems could expose it to unexpected losses and its financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected any such inadequacy or lapse could table start table end hinder the timely escalation of material risk issues to jpmorgan chases senior management and board of directors lead to business decisions that have negative outcomes for jpmorgan chase require significant resources and time to remediate lead to noncompliance with laws rules and regulations attract heightened regulatory scrutiny expose jpmorgan chase to regulatory investigations or legal proceedings subject it to litigation or regulatory fines penalties or other sanctions lead to potential harm to customers and clients and any liability associated with that harm harm its reputation or otherwise diminish confidence in jpmorgan chase jpmorgan chase relies on data to assess its various risk exposures any deficiencies in the quality or effectiveness of jpmorgan chases data gathering analysis and validation processes could result in ineffective risk management practices these deficiencies could also result in inaccurate risk reporting many of jpmorgan chases risk management strategies and techniques consider historical market behavior and to some degree are based on managements subjective judgment or assumptions for example many models used by jpmorgan chase are based on assumptions regarding historical correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators in times of market stress including difficult or less liquid market environments or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated conversely previouslycorrelated indicators may become uncorrelated at those times sudden market movements and unanticipated market or economic movements could in some circumstances limit the effectiveness of jpmorgan chases risk management strategies causing it to incur losses jpmorgan chase could recognize unexpected losses its capital levels could be reduced and it could face greater regulatory scrutiny if its models estimations or judgments including those used in its financial statements prove to be inadequate or incorrect jpmorgan chase has developed and uses a variety of models and other analytical and judgmentbased estimations to measure monitor and implement controls over its market credit capital liquidity operational and other risks jpmorgan chase also uses internal models and estimations as a basis for its stress testing and in connection with the preparation of its financial statements under us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap these models and estimations are based on a variety of assumptions and historical trends and are periodically reviewed and modified as necessary the models and estimations that jpmorgan chase uses may not be effective in all cases to identify observe and mitigate risk due to a variety of factors such as reliance on historical trends that may not persist in the future including assumptions underlying the models and estimations such as correlations among certain market indicators or asset prices inherent limitations associated with forecasting uncertain economic and financial outcomes historical trend information may be incomplete or may not be indicative of severely negative market conditions such as extreme volatility dislocation or lack of liquidity sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain financial instruments technology that is introduced to run models or estimations may not perform as expected or may not be well understood by the personnel using the technology models and estimations may contain erroneous data valuations formulas or algorithms and review processes may fail to detect flaws in models and estimations jpmorgan chase may experience unexpected losses if models estimates or judgments used or applied in connection with its risk management activities or the preparation of its financial statements prove to have been inadequate or incorrect for example where quoted market prices are not available for certain financial instruments that require a determination of their fair value jpmorgan chase may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management estimates and judgment similarly jpmorgan chase establishes an allowance for expected credit losses related to its credit exposures which requires difficult subjective and complex judgments including forecasts of how economic conditions might impair the ability of jpmorgan chases borrowers and counterparties to repay their loans or other obligations these types of estimates and judgments may not prove to be accurate due to
