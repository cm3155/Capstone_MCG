portion of the securities inventory held in the context of market making and customer activities secured funding transactions are predominantly collateralized by government debt securities generally changes in the level of citis secured funding are primarily due to fluctuations in secured lending activity in the matched book as described below and changes in securities inventory in order to

liquidity resources of certain citibank entities citibank could reduce the funding and liquidity risk if any of the potential downgrades described above through mitigating actions including repricing or reducing certain commitments to commercial paper conduits in the event of the potential downgrades described above citi believes that certain corporate customers could reevaluate their deposit relationships with citibank this reevaluation could result in clients adjusting their discretionary deposit levels or changing their depository institution which could potentially reduce certain deposit levels at citibank however citi could choose to adjust pricing offer alternative deposit products to its existing customers or seek to attract deposits from new customers in addition to the mitigating actions referenced above in addition citi uses multiple metrics to measure its banking book interest rate risk interest rate exposure ire is a key metric that analyzes the impact of a range of scenarios on citis banking book net interest income and certain other interest ratesensitive income versus a base case ire does not represent a forecast of citis net interest income the scenarios methodologies and assumptions used in this analysis are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the market environment changes in citis balance sheet composition enhancements in citis modeling and other factors under the enhanced methodology citi utilizes the most recent quarterend balance sheet assuming no changes to its composition and size over the forecasted horizon holding the balance sheet static the forecasts incorporate expectations and assumptions of deposit pricing loan spreads and mortgage prepayment behavior implied by the interest rate curves in each scenario the base case scenario reflects the market implied forward interest rates and sensitivity scenarios assume instantaneous shocks to the base case the forecasts do not assume citi takes any riskmitigating actions in response to changes in the interest rate environment certain interest rates are subject to flooring assumptions in downward rate scenarios deposit pricing sensitivities ie deposit betas are informed by historical and expected behavior actual deposit pricing could differ from the assumptions used in these forecasts citis ire analysis primarily reflects the impacts from the following banking book assets and liabilities loans client deposits citis deposits with other banks investment securities longterm debt any related interest rate hedges and the funds transfer pricing of positions in total trading and credit portfolio value at risk var it excludes impacts from any positions that are included in total trading and credit portfolio var in addition to ire citi analyzes economic value sensitivity evs as a longerterm interest rate risk metric evs is a net present value npvbased measure of the lifetime cash flows of citis banking book it estimates the interest rate sensitivity of the banking books economic value from longerterm assets being potentially funded with shorter term liabilities or vice versa citi manages evs within risk limits approved by citigroups board of directors that are aligned with citis risk appetite market risk market risk arises from both citis trading and nontrading portfolios for additional information on market risk and market risk management at citi see market risk overview and risk factors in citis form 10k market risk of nontrading portfolios market risk from nontrading portfolios stems predominantly from the potential impact of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on citis net interest income and on citis accumulated other comprehensive income loss aoci from its investment securities portfolios market risk from nontrading portfolios also includes the potential impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on citis capital invested in foreign currencies banking book interest rate risk for interest rate risk purposes citis nontrading portfolios are referred to as the banking book management of interest rate risk in the banking book is governed by citis nontrading market risk policy managements asset liability committee alco establishes citis risk appetite and related limits for interest rate risk in the banking book which are subject to approval by citigroups board of directors corporate treasury is responsible for the daytoday management of citis banking book interest rate risk as well as periodically reviewing it with the alco citis banking book interest rate risk management is also subject to independent oversight from the second line of defense team reporting to the chief risk officer changes in interest rates impact citis net income aoci and cet1 these changes primarily affect citis banking book through net interest income due to a variety of risk factors including differences in timing and amounts of the maturity or repricing of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments changes in the level andor shape of interest rate curves client behavior in response to changes in interest rates eg mortgage prepayments deposit betas and changes in the maturity of instruments resulting from changes in the interest rate environment as part of their ongoing activities citis businesses generate interest ratesensitive positions from their client facing products such as loans and deposits the component of this interest rate risk that can be hedged is transferred via citis funds transfer pricing process to corporate treasury corporate treasury uses various tools to manage the total interest rate risk position within the established risk appetite and target citis desired risk profile including its investment securities portfolio companyissued debt and interest rate derivatives interest rate risk of investment portfoliosimpact on aoci citi measures the potential impacts of changes in interest rates on the value of its aoci which can in turn impact citis common equity and tangible common equity this will impact citis cet1 and other regulatory capital ratios citi seeks to manage its exposure to changes in the market level of interest rates while limiting the potential impact on its aoci and regulatory capital position aoci at risk is managed as part of the companywide interest rate risk position aoci at risk considers potential changes in aoci and the corresponding impact on the cet1 capital ratio relative to citis capital generation capacity citi uses basis point bps shocks in each scenario to reflect its net interest income sensitivity to unanticipated changes in market interest rates as potential monetary policy decisions and changes in economic conditions may be reflected in current marketimplied

direction estimated positive impact in the bps shock scenario and not offsetting citis balance sheet is asset sensitive assets reprice faster than liabilities resulting in higher net interest income in increasing interest rate scenarios the estimated impact to citis net interest income in a bps upward rate shock scenario as of march was largely unchanged quarter overquarter and decreased yearoveryear primarily reflecting the net impact of lower expected gains due to us dollar interest rate moves that have already been realized and changes in citis balance sheet at progressively higher interest rate levels the marginal net interest income benefit is lower as citi assumes it will pass on a larger share of rate changes to depositors ie higher betas further reducing citis ire sensitivity currencyspecific interest rate changes and balance sheet factors may drive quartertoquarter volatility in citis estimated ire in a bps upward rate shock scenario citi expects that the approximate billion initial negative impact to aoci could potentially be offset in shareholders equity through the expected recovery of the impact on aoci through accretion of citis investment portfolio and expected net interest income benefit over a period of approximately six months scenario analysis the following table presents the estimated impact to citis net interest income aoci and cet1 capital ratio on a fully implemented basis under six different scenarios of changes in interest rates for the us dollar and all other currencies in which citi has invested capital as of march the bps downward rate scenarios are impacted by the low level of interest rates in several countries and the assumption that market interest rates as well as rates paid to depositors and charged to borrowers do not fall below zero ie the flooring assumption the interest rate scenarios are also impacted by convexity related to mortgage products and deposit pricing in millions of dollars except as otherwise noted scenario scenario scenario scenario scenario scenario overnight rate change bps 10year rate change bps interest rate exposure us dollar all other currencies1 total estimated initial impact to aoci aftertax2 estimated initial impact to cet1 capital ratio bps from aoci scenario note each scenario assumes that the rate change will occur instantaneously changes in interest rates for maturities between the overnight rate and the 10year rate are interpolated the interest rate exposure in the table above assumes no change in deposit size or mix from the baseline forecast included in the different interest scenarios presented as a result in higher interest rate scenarios customer activity resulting in a shift from noninterestbearing and low interest rate deposit products to higher yielding deposits would reduce the expected benefit to net interest income conversely in lower interest rate scenarios customer activity resulting in a shift from higheryielding deposits to noninterestbearing and low interest rate deposit products would reduce the expected decrease to net interest income scenario includes the impact from the following top five nonus dollar currencies which represents approximately of the total nonus dollar currency impact approximately billion each from the british pound sterling and japanese yen and approximately billion each from the indian rupee singapore dollar and south korean won these impacts per currency are generally in the same direction estimated positive impact in the bps shock scenario and not offsetting includes the effect of changes in interest rates on aoci related to investment securities cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments as presented in the table above the estimated impact to citis net interest income is larger under scenario than scenario as citis banking book has relatively higher interest rate exposure to the short end of the yield curve for us dollars exposure to downward rate shocks is larger in magnitude than to upward rate shocks this is because of the lower benefit to net interest income from citis deposit base at higher rate levels as well as the prepayment effects on mortgage loans and mortgagebacked securities for other nonus dollar currencies exposure to downward rate shocks is smaller in magnitude as a result of citis flooring assumption given low rate levels for certain nonus dollar currencies the magnitude of the impact to aoci is greater under scenario compared to scenario this is because the combination of changes to citis investment portfolio partially offset by changes related to citis pension liabilities results in a net position that is more sensitive to rates at shorter and intermediateterm maturities changes in foreign exchange ratesimpacts on aoci and capital as of march citi estimates that an unanticipated parallel instantaneous appreciation of the us dollar against all of the other currencies in which citi has invested capital could reduce citis

including russian corporate clients citis role as paying agent is administrative in this role citi acts as an agent of its client the bond issuer receiving interest and principal payments from the bond issuer and then making payments to international central securities depositories eg depository trust company euroclear clearstream the international central securities depositories icsds make payments to those participants or account holders eg broker dealers that have clients who are investors in the applicable bonds ie bondholders as a paying agent citi generally does not have information about the identity of the bondholders citi may be exposed to risks due to its responsibilities for receiving and processing payments on behalf of its clients as a result of sanctions or other governmental requirements and prohibitions to mitigate operational and sanctions risks citi has established policies procedures and controls for client relationships and payment processing to help ensure compliance with us uk eu and other jurisdictions sanctions laws these processes may require citi to delay or withhold the processing of payments as a result of sanctions on the bond issuer

protect its reputation with its colleagues clients customers investors regulators and the public citis response to the war in ukraine including any action or inaction may have a negative impact on citis reputation with some or all of these parties for example citi is exposed to reputational risk as a result of its remaining presence in russia and association with russian individuals or entities whether subject to sanctions or not including citis inability to support its global clients in russia which could adversely affect its broader client relationships and businesses current involvement in transactions or supporting activities involving russian assets or interests failure to correctly interpret and apply laws and regulations including those related to sanctions perceived misalignment of citis actions to its stated strategy in russia and the reputational impact from citis activity and engagement with ukraine or with nonrussian clients exiting their russia businesses while citi announced its intention to wind down its businesses in russia citi will continue to manage those operations during the winddown process and will be required to maintain certain limited operations to fulfill its remaining legal and regulatory obligations also sanctions and sanctions compliance are highly complex and may change over time and result in increased operational risk failure to fully comply with relevant sanctions or the application of sanctions where they should not be applied may negatively impact citis reputation in addition citi currently performs services for conducts business with or deals in nonsanctioned russian owned businesses and russian assets this has attracted and will likely continue to attract negative attention despite the previously disclosed plan to wind down nearly all its activities in the country cessation of new business and client originations and reduction of other exposures citis continued presence or divestiture of businesses in russia

through its services markets and banking businesses as of march citis net investment in its argentine operations was approximately billion compared to billion at december citi uses the us dollar usd as the functional currency for its operations in countries such as argentina that are deemed highly inflationary in accordance with gaap citi therefore records the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on its net argentine peso arsdenominated assets directly in earnings citi uses argentinas official market exchange rate to remeasure its net arsdenominated assets into usd as of march the official ars exchange rate was which devalued by against the usd during the first quarter of the increase in citis net investment in argentina during the quarter was primarily due to earnings associated with increased client activity citis normal onshore operations and interest income earned on the net investment of which a significant portion is invested at high local overnight rates in argentina all of these effects significantly exceeded translation losses net of hedges of million recognized during the quarter the central bank of argentina maintains certain capital and currency controls that generally restrict citis ability to access usd in argentina and remit earnings from its argentine operations to the extent that such controls remain in place citis net investment in argentina will as a result continue to be exposed to additional foreign currency translation losses if it is denominated in ars and is unable to be remitted or exchanged furthermore the capital and currency controls have resulted in indirect foreign exchange mechanisms that some argentine entities may use to obtain usd generally at rates that are significantly higher than argentinas official exchange rate citibank argentina is generally precluded from accessing these alternative mechanisms and under us gaap these exchange mechanisms cannot be used to remeasure citis net monetary assets into usd if argentinas official exchange rate further converges with the approximate rate implied by the indirect foreign exchange mechanisms citi could incur additional translation losses on its net investment in argentina accordingly citi seeks to reduce its overall ars exposure in argentina while complying with local capital and currency exposure limitations of the billion net investment in argentina as of march citis net ars exposure was approximately billion the net ars exposure was reduced as of the end of the quarter as a result of citi holding approximately million of usddenominated loans as well as approximately million of certain local government bonds that are indexed to the higher of the usd exchange rate or the local inflation index if citi had not invested in such instruments to reduce its ars exposure citi would have recognized additional translation losses during the first quarter of given current economic conditions and the local capital currency and regulatory limitations citi cannot guarantee the availability or effectiveness of such mechanisms to reduce its ars exposure in the future in addition to reducing the ars exposure citi also seeks to economically hedge the exposure to the extent possible and prudent using nondeliverable forward ndf derivative instruments that are primarily executed outside of argentina as of march citi was unable to hedge a substantial portion of the remaining ars exposure given that the offshore ndf market remained illiquid accordingly and to the extent that citi does not execute additional ndf contracts for this unhedged exposure in the future citi would record devaluations on its net arsdenominated assets in earnings without any benefit from a change in the fair value of derivative positions used to economically hedge the exposure citi cannot predict the availability of hedging instruments in the future nor can it predict changes in foreign exchange rates and the resulting impact on earnings citi continually evaluates its economic exposure to its argentine counterparties and reserves for changes in credit risk and records marktomarket adjustments for relevant market risks associated with its argentine assets citi believes it has established an appropriate acl on its argentine loans and appropriate fair value adjustments on argentine assets and liabilities measured at fair value for credit and sovereign risks
