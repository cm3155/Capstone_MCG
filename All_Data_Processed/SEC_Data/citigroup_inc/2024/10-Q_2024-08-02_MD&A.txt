regulatory actions at the end of each year the compensation committee determines the appropriate level of payout given the accomplishments for the performance period relative to the specific goals and related metrics the maximum portion of the bonus payable for each tranche is for the first tranche for the second tranche and for the third tranche following the completion of the first performance measurement period under the transformation bonus program the compensation committee determined that the performance achievement percentage for the period ending december was reflecting the compensation committees assessment of performance relative to the predetermined targets set for that tranche under the program the targets established for the first performance period included citis submission to the frb and occ of plans to remediate the issues addressed by the consent orders and objectively measurable targets to assess performance on transformation milestones the compensation committee recognized that management performed above achievement relative to targets on each metric category during the first performance period with the exception of one the percentage of milestones that were at risk for not being completed on time for which citi fell three percentage points short of target following the completion of the second performance measurement period under the program

quantitative metrics timely execution of the commitments scheduled to be completed and execution quality which is the percentage of those commitments deemed complete by citis internal audit function the third criterion for the second performance measurement period was a qualitative consideration of citis cultural change measured by its broadbased voice of the employee survey designed to measure cultural alignment with citis leadership principles the compensation committee has determined that the metric categories for the third tranche of the program covering the calendar year performance period will be the same as the metric categories for the second tranche the compensation committee has set specific objective targets with respect to performance metrics within those categories for
