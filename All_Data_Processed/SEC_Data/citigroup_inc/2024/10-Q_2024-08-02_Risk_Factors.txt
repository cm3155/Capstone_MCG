entities to efficiently fund both i secured lending activity and ii a portion of the securities inventory held in the context of market making and customer activities secured funding transactions are predominantly collateralized by government debt securities generally changes in the level of citis secured funding are primarily due to fluctuations in secured lending activity in the matched book as

above through mitigating actions including repricing or reducing certain commitments to commercial paper conduits in the event of the potential downgrades described above citi believes that certain corporate customers could reevaluate their deposit relationships with citibank this reevaluation could result in clients adjusting their discretionary deposit levels or changing their depository institution which could potentially reduce certain deposit levels at citibank however citi could choose to adjust pricing offer alternative deposit products to its existing customers or seek to attract deposits from new customers in addition to the mitigating actions referenced above in addition citi uses multiple metrics to measure its banking book interest rate risk interest rate exposure ire is a key metric that analyzes the impact of a range of scenarios on citis banking book net interest income and certain other interest ratesensitive income versus a base case ire does not represent a forecast of citis net interest income the scenarios methodologies and assumptions used in this analysis are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the market environment changes in citis balance sheet composition enhancements in citis modeling and other factors citi utilizes the most recent quarterend balance sheet assuming no changes to its composition and size over the forecasted horizon holding the balance sheet static the forecasts incorporate expectations and assumptions of deposit pricing loan spreads and mortgage prepayment behavior implied by the interest rate curves in each scenario the base case scenario reflects the marketimplied forward interest rates and sensitivity scenarios assume instantaneous shocks to the base case the forecasts do not assume citi takes any risk mitigating actions in response to changes in the interest rate environment certain interest rates are subject to flooring assumptions in downward rate scenarios deposit pricing sensitivities ie deposit betas are informed by historical and expected behavior actual deposit pricing could differ from the assumptions used in these forecasts citis ire analysis primarily reflects the impacts from the following banking book assets and liabilities loans client deposits citis deposits with other banks investment securities longterm debt any related interest rate hedges and the funds transfer pricing of positions in total trading and credit portfolio value at risk var it excludes impacts from any positions that are included in total trading and credit portfolio var in addition to ire citi analyzes economic value sensitivity evs as a longerterm interest rate risk metric evs is a net present value npvbased measure of the lifetime cash flows of citis banking book it estimates the interest rate sensitivity of the banking books economic value from longerterm assets being potentially funded with shorter term liabilities or vice versa citi manages evs within risk limits approved by citigroups board of directors that are aligned with citis risk appetite market risk market risk arises from both citis trading and nontrading portfolios for additional information on market risk and market risk management at citi see market risk overview and risk factors in citis form 10k market risk of nontrading portfolios market risk from nontrading portfolios stems predominantly from the potential impact of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on citis net interest income and on citis accumulated other comprehensive income loss aoci from its investment securities portfolios market risk from nontrading portfolios also includes the potential impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on citis capital invested in foreign currencies banking book interest rate risk for interest rate risk purposes citis nontrading portfolios are referred to as the banking book management of interest rate risk in the banking book is governed by citis

book interest rate risk management is also subject to independent oversight from the second line of defense team reporting to the chief risk officer changes in interest rates impact citis net income aoci and cet1 these changes primarily affect citis banking book through net interest income due to a variety of risk factors including differences in timing and amounts of the maturity or repricing of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments changes in the level andor shape of interest rate curves client behavior in response to changes in interest rates eg mortgage prepayments deposit betas and changes in the maturity of instruments resulting from changes in the interest rate environment as part of their ongoing activities citis businesses generate interest ratesensitive positions from their client facing products such as loans and deposits the component of this interest rate risk that can be hedged is transferred via citis funds transfer pricing process to corporate treasury corporate treasury uses various tools to manage the total interest rate risk position within the established risk appetite and target citis desired risk profile including its investment securities portfolio companyissued debt and interest rate derivatives interest rate risk of investment portfoliosimpact on aoci citi measures the potential impacts of changes in interest rates on the value of its aoci which can in turn impact citis common equity and tangible common equity this will impact citis cet1 and other regulatory capital ratios citi seeks to manage its exposure to changes in the

depositors ie higher betas further reducing citis ire sensitivity currency specific interest rate changes and balance sheet factors may drive quartertoquarter volatility in citis estimated ire in a bps upward rate shock scenario citi expects that the approximate billion initial negative impact to aoci could potentially be offset in shareholders equity through the expected recovery of the impact on aoci through accretion of citis investment portfolio and expected net interest income benefit over a period of approximately six months scenario analysis the following table presents the estimated impact to citis net interest income and aoci under six different scenarios of changes in interest rates for the us dollar and all other currencies in which citi has invested capital as of june the bps downward rate scenarios potentially may be impacted by the low level of interest rates in several countries and the assumption that market interest rates as well as rates paid to depositors and charged to borrowers do not fall below zero ie the flooring assumption the interest rate scenarios are also impacted by convexity related to mortgage products and deposit pricing in millions of dollars except as otherwise noted scenario scenario scenario scenario scenario scenario overnight rate change bps 10year rate change bps interest rate exposure us dollar all other currencies1 total estimated initial impact to aoci aftertax2 note each scenario assumes that the rate change will occur instantaneously changes in interest rates for maturities between the overnight rate and the 10year rate are interpolated the interest rate exposure in the table above assumes no change in deposit size or mix from the baseline forecast included in the different interest scenarios presented as a result in higher interest rate scenarios customer activity resulting in a shift from noninterestbearing and low interest rate deposit products to higher yielding deposits would reduce the expected benefit to net interest income conversely in lower interest rate scenarios customer activity resulting in a shift from higheryielding deposits to noninterestbearing and low interest rate deposit products would reduce the expected decrease to net interest income the scenario impact of million consists of the following top five nonus dollar currencies as of june by absolute size approximately billion from the euro billion each from the british pound sterling and japanese yen and approximately billion each from the indian rupee and chinese yuan the remaining balance is spread across more than additional currencies includes the effect of changes in interest rates on aoci related to investment securities cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments as presented in the table above the estimated impact to citis net interest income is larger under scenario than scenario as citis banking book has relatively higher interest rate exposure to the short end of the yield curve for us dollars exposure to downward rate shocks is smaller in magnitude than to upward rate shocks this is because of the lower benefit to net interest income from citis deposit base at higher rate levels as well as the prepayment effects on mortgage loans and mortgagebacked securities the magnitude of the impact to aoci is greater under scenario compared to scenario this is because citis investment portfolio and pension liabilities are more sensitive to rates at shorter and intermediateterm maturities changes in foreign exchange ratesimpacts on aoci and capital as of june citi estimates that an unanticipated parallel instantaneous appreciation of the us dollar against all of the other currencies in which citi has invested capital could reduce citis tangible common equity tce by approximately billion or as a result of changes to citis cta in aoci net of hedges this impact would be primarily due to changes in the value of the mexican peso euro singapore dollar and indian rupee this impact is also before any mitigating actions citi may take including ongoing management of its foreign currency translation exposure specifically as currency movements change the value of citis net investments in foreign currency denominated capital these movements also change the value of citis rwa denominated in those currencies this coupled with citis foreign currency hedging strategies such as foreign currency borrowings foreign currency forwards and other currency hedging instruments lessens the impact of foreign currency movements on citis cet1 capital ratio changes in these hedging strategies as well as hedging costs divestitures and tax impacts can further affect the actual impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on citis capital compared to an unanticipated parallel shock as described above the effect of citis ongoing management strategies with respect to quarterly changes in foreign exchange rates and the quarterly impact of these changes on citis tce and cet1 capital ratio are presented in the table below see note for additional information on the changes in aoci in millions of dollars except as otherwise noted change in fx spot rate1 change in tce due to fx

accordance with basel iii citi is required to perform back testing to evaluate the effectiveness of its regulatory var model regulatory var backtesting is the process in which the daily oneday var at a confidence interval is compared to the buyandhold profit and loss ie the profit and loss impact if the portfolio is held constant at the end of the day and repriced the following day buyandhold profit and loss represents the daily marktomarket profit and loss attributable to price movements in covered positions from the close of the previous business day buyandhold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue net interest fees and commissions intraday trading profit and loss and changes in reserves based on a confidence level citi would expect two to three days in any one year where buyandhold losses exceed the regulatory var given the conservative calibration of citis var model as a result of taking the greater of short and longterm volatilities and fattail scaling of
