risk factors the following discussion presents what management currently believes could be the material risks and uncertainties that could impact citis businesses results of operations and financial condition other risks and uncertainties including those not currently known to citi or its management could also negatively impact citis businesses results of operations and financial condition thus the following should not be considered a complete discussion of all of the risks and uncertainties that citi may face for additional information about risks and uncertainties that could impact citi see executive summary and each respective businesss results of operations above and managing global risk below the following risk factors are categorized to improve the readability and usefulness of the risk factor disclosure and while the headings and risk factors generally align with citis risk categorization in certain instances the risk factors may not directly correspond with how citi categorizes or manages its risks marketrelated risks macroeconomic geopolitical and other challenges and uncertainties could continue to have a negative impact on citi citi has experienced and could experience in the future negative impacts to its businesses results of operations and financial condition as a result of various macroeconomic geopolitical and other challenges uncertainties and volatility these include among other things government fiscal and monetary actions or expected actions including continued high interest rates reductions in central bank balance sheets or other restrictive interest rate or other monetary policies potential recessions in the us europe and other regions or countries and elevated levels of inflation for example in the us the uk the eu and other economies continued to experience elevated levels of inflation as a result the federal reserve board frb and other central banks substantially raised interest rates reduced the size of their balance sheets and took other actions in an aggressive effort to curb inflation these actions may continue to adversely impact certain sectors sensitive to interest rates and consumer discretionary spending they may also slow economic growth increase the risk of recession and increase the unemployment rate in the us and other countries all of which would likely adversely affect citis consumer and institutional clients businesses and results of operations in addition inflation may continue to result in higher labor and other costs thus putting further pressure on citis expenses more recently the frb has signaled that it expects to reduce the benchmark us interest rate in if the frb were to reduce interest rates prematurely inflation could resurge interest rates on loans citi makes are typically based off or set at a spread over a benchmark interest rate and would likely decline or rise as benchmark rates decline or rise respectively for example while a decline in interest rates would generally be expected to result in lower overall net interest income it could improve citis funding costs although higher interest rates would generally be expected to increase overall net interest income higher rates could adversely affect funding costs levels of deposits in its consumer and institutional businesses and certain business or product revenues in addition citis net interest income could be adversely affected due to a flattening a lower spread between shorterterm versus longerterm interest rates or longer lasting or more severe inversion shorterterm interest rates exceeding longerterm interest rates of the interest rate yield curve as citi typically pays interest on deposits based on shorterterm interest rates and earns money on loans based on longerterm interest rates for additional information on citis interest rate risk see managing global riskmarket risk banking book interest rate risk below additionally citis balance sheet includes interestrate sensitive fixedrate assets such as us treasuries us agency securities and residential mortgages among others whose valuation would be adversely impacted in a higherrate environment andor whose hedging costs may increase additional areas of uncertainty include among others geopolitical challenges tensions and conflicts including those related to russias war in ukraine see discussion below as well as a persistent andor escalating conflict in the middle east particularly if the conflict were to widen to involve additional combatants countries or regions economic and other geopolitical challenges related to china including weak economic growth related policy actions challenges in the chinese real estate sector banking and credit markets and tensions or conflicts between china and taiwan andor china and the us significant disruptions and volatility in financial markets including foreign currency volatility and devaluations and continued strength in the us dollar protracted or widespread trade tensions natural disasters new pandemics including new covid19 variants and political polarization election outcomes and the effects of divided government such as with respect to any extended government shutdown in the us for example citis marketmaking businesses can suffer losses resulting from the widening of credit spreads due to unanticipated changes in financial markets moreover adverse developments or downturns in one or more of the worlds larger economies would likely have a significant impact on the global economy or the economies of other countries because of global financial and economic linkages russias war in ukraine has caused supply shocks in energy food and other commodities markets worsened inflation increased cybersecurity risks increased the risk of recession in europe and heightened geopolitical tensions actions by russia and any further measures taken by the us or its allies could continue to have negative impacts on regional and global energy and other commodities and financial markets and macroeconomic conditions adversely impacting jurisdictions where citi operates and has customers clients or employees citis remaining operations in russia subject citi to various other risks among which are foreign currency volatility including appreciations or devaluations restrictions arising from retaliatory russian laws and regulations on the conduct of its remaining businesses including without limitation its provision to its customers of certain securities services sanctions or asset freezes and other deconsolidation events in the event of a loss of control of ao citibank citi would be required to write off its net investment in the entity recognize a cta loss through earnings and recognize a loss on intercompany liabilities owed by ao citibank to other citi entities outside of russia in the sole event of a substantial liquidation as opposed to a loss of control citi would be required to recognize the cta loss through earnings and would evaluate its remaining net investment as circumstances evolve for additional information about these risks see the operational processes and systems cybersecurity and emerging markets risk factors and managing global riskother riskscountry risk russia below strategic risks citis ability to return capital to common shareholders substantially depends on regulatory capital requirements including the results of the ccar process and doddfrank act regulatory stress tests and other factors citis ability to return capital to its common shareholders consistent with its capital planning efforts and targets whether through its common stock dividend or through a share repurchase program substantially depends among other things on its regulatory capital requirements including the annual recalibration of the stress capital buffer scb which is based upon the results of the ccar process required by the frb and recalibration of the gsib surchargeas well as the supervisory expectations and assessments regarding individual institutions the frbs annual stress testing requirements are integrated into ongoing regulatory capital requirements citis scb equals the maximum projected decline in its cet1 capital ratio under the supervisory severely adverse scenario over a ninequarter ccar measurement period plus four quarters of planned common stock dividends as a percentage of citis riskweighted assets subject to a minimum requirement of the scb is calculated by the frb using its proprietary data and modeling of each firms results accordingly citis scb may change annually based on the supervisory stress test results thus potentially resulting in variability in the calculation of citis required regulatory cet1 capital ratio under the standardized approach on october citis required regulatory cet1 capital ratio increased to from under the standardized approach reflecting the increase in the scb requirement to from in addition a breach of the scb and other regulatory capital buffers may result in gradual limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers for additional information on the scb see capital resourcesregulatory capital buffers above moreover changes in regulatory capital rules requirements or interpretations could materially increase citis required regulatory capital for example the us banking regulators have proposed a number of changes to the us regulatory capital framework including but not limited to significant revisions to the us basel iii rules known as the basel iii endgame capital proposal changes to the method for calculating the gsib surcharge and changes to aspects of the total lossabsorbing capacity tlac requirements the capital proposal would replace the advanced approaches with a new expanded riskbased approach for calculating risk weighted assets under the capital proposal a single capital buffer including the scb would apply to a firms riskbased capital ratios regardless of whether the applicable ratios result from the expanded riskbased approach or the modified standardized approach additionally the capital proposal would make various changes to the calculations of credit risk market risk and operational risk components of riskweighted assets see capital resourcesregulatory capital standards and developments above all of these potential changes if adopted as proposed would likely materially impact citis regulatory capital position and substantially increase citis regulatory capital requirements and thus adversely impact the extent to which citi is able to return capital to shareholders citis ability to return capital also depends on its results of operations and financial condition including the capital impact related to its remaining divestitures such as among other things any temporary capital impact from cta losses net of hedges between transaction signings and closings see the continued investments and the incorrect assumptions or estimates risk factors below citis effectiveness in planning managing and calculating its level of regulatory capital and riskweighted assets under both the advanced approaches and the standardized approach as well as the supplementary leverage ratio slr its implementation and maintenance of an effective capital planning process and management framework forecasts of macroeconomic conditions and deferred tax asset dta utilization see the ability to utilize dta risk factor below the frb could also limit or prohibit capital actions such as paying or increasing dividends or repurchasing common stock due to macroeconomic disruptions or events some of which occurred for a period of time during the covid19 pandemic all firms subject to ccar requirements including citi will continue to be subject to a rigorous regulatory evaluation of capital planning practices and other reviews and examinations including but not limited to data quality which is a key regulatory focus governance risk management and internal controls for example the frb has stated that it expects capital adequacy practices to continue to evolve and to likely be determined by its yearly crossfirm review of capital plan submissions similarly the frb has indicated that as part of its stated goal to continually evolve its annual stress testing requirements several parameters of the annual stress testing process may continue to be altered including the number and severity of the stress test scenarios the frb modeling of citis balance sheet preprovision net revenue and stress losses and the addition of components deemed important by the frb additionally citis ability to return capital may be adversely impacted if a regulatory evaluation or examination results in negative findings regarding absolute capital levels or other aspects of citis operations including as a result of the imposition of additional capital buffers limitations on capital distributions or otherwise for information on limitations on citis ability to return capital to common shareholders as well as the ccar process supervisory stress test requirements and gsib surcharge see capital resourcesoverview and capital resources stress testing component of capital planning above and the risk management risk factor below in december the frb announced that it will maintain its current framework for calculating allowances on loans in the supervisory stress test through the stress test cycle while continuing to evaluate appropriate future enhancements to this framework the impacts on citis capital adequacy of any potential incorporation by the frb of cecl into its supervisory stress tests in future stress test cycles and of other potential regulatory changes in the frbs stress testing methodologies remain unclear for additional information regarding the cecl methodology including the transition provisions related to the adverse regulatory capital effects resulting from adoption of the cecl methodology see capital resourcescurrent regulatory capital standards regulatory capital treatmentmodified transition of the current expected credit losses methodology above and note although various uncertainties exist regarding the extent of and the ultimate impact to citi from changes to regulatory capital results from the frbs stress testing and ccar regimes and regulatory evaluation or examination findings these changes could increase the level of capital citi is required or elects to hold including as part of citis management buffer thus potentially adversely impacting the extent to which citi is able to return capital to shareholders citi must continually review analyze and successfully adapt to ongoing regulatory and legislative uncertainties and changes in the us and globally citi its management and its businesses continue to face regulatory and legislative uncertainties and changes both in the us and globally while the ongoing regulatory and legislative uncertainties and changes facing citi are too numerous to list completely examples include but are not limited to i potential changes to various aspects of the us regulatory capital framework and requirements applicable to citi including among others significant revisions to the us basel iii rules known as the basel iii endgame for information about the basel iii endgame see the capital return risk factor and capital resourcesregulatory capital standards developments above ii potential fiscal monetary tax sanctions and other changes promulgated by the us federal government and other governments including potential changes in regulatory requirements relating to interest rate risk management and iii rapidly evolving legislative and regulatory requirements and other government initiatives in the eu the us and globally related to climate change and other esg areas that vary and may conflict across jurisdictions including any new disclosure requirements see the climate change and heightened regulatory scrutiny and ongoing interpretation of regulatory changes risk factors below references to regulatory refer to both formal regulation and the views and expectations of citis regulators in their supervisory roles which as they change over time can have a major impact in particular the us regulators have indicated that the level of their expectations is increasing and prompt negative examination findingsratings and enforcements actions are more likely for example in february the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb proposed significant changes to the maximum amounts on credit card late fees which if adopted as proposed would reduce credit card fee revenues in branded cards and retail services in uspb in addition us and international regulatory and legislative initiatives have not always been undertaken or implemented on a coordinated basis and areas of divergence have developed and continue to develop with respect to their scope interpretation timing structure or approach leading to inconsistent or even conflicting requirements including within a single jurisdiction further ongoing regulatory and legislative uncertainties and changes make citis longterm business balance sheet and strategic budget planning difficult subject to change and potentially more costly and may impact its results of operations us and other regulators globally have implemented and continue to discuss various changes to certain regulatory requirements which would require ongoing assessment by management as to the impact to citi its businesses and business planning business planning must necessarily be based on possible or proposed rules or outcomes which can change significantly upon finalization or upon implementation or interpretive guidance from numerous regulatory bodies worldwide and such guidance can change regulatory and legislative changes have also significantly increased citis compliance risks and costs see the implementation and interpretation of regulatory changes risk factor below and can adversely affect citis competitive position as well as its businesses results of operations and financial condition citis ability to achieve its objectives from its transformation organizational simplification and other strategic and other initiatives may not be as successful as it projects or expects as part of its transformation initiatives citi continues to make significant investments to improve its risk and controls environment modernize its data and technology infrastructure and further enhance safety and soundness see executive summary above and the legal and regulatory proceedings risk factor below citi also continues to make businessled investments as part of the execution of its strategic initiatives for example citi has been making investments across the company including hiring front office colleagues in key strategic markets and businesses enhancing product capabilities and platforms to grow key businesses improve client digital experiences and add scalability and implementing new capabilities and partnerships these businessled investments are designed to grow revenues as well as result in retention and efficiency improvements additionally citi has been pursuing overall simplification initiatives that include management and operating model changes and actions to enhance focus on clients and reduce expenses citis simplification actions also include divestiture of the mexico consumersbmm operations and completing other exits and winddowns in order to streamline citi and assist in optimizing its allocation of resources these overall simplification initiatives involve various execution challenges and may result in higher than expected expenses litigation and regulatory scrutiny cta and other losses or other negative financial or strategic impacts which could be material for information about potential cta impacts see the capital return risk factor above and the incorrect assumptions or estimates risk factor below citis multiyear transformation as well as its simplification initiatives involve significant complexities and uncertainties in addition there is inherent risk that citis transformation and simplification initiatives will not be as productive or effective as citi expects or at all conversely failure to adequately invest in and upgrade citis technology and processes or properly implement its enterprisewide simplification could result in citis inability to meet regulatory expectations be sufficiently competitive serve clients effectively and avoid disruptions to its businesses and operational errors see the operational processes and systems and legal and regulatory proceedings risk factors below citis ability to achieve expected returns and operational improvements depends in part on factors that it cannot control including among others macroeconomic challenges and uncertainties customer client and competitor actions and ongoing regulatory requirements or changes citis transformation strategic and other initiatives may continue to evolve as its business strategies the market environment and regulatory expectations change which could make the initiatives more costly and more challenging to implement and limit their effectiveness climate change presents various financial and non financial risks to citi and its customers and clients climate change presents both immediate and longterm risks to citi and its customers and clients with the risks expected to increase over time climate risks can arise from both physical risks those risks related to the physical effects of climate change and transition risks risks related to regulatory market technological stakeholder and legal changes from a transition to a lowcarbon economy physical and transition risks can manifest themselves differently across citis risk categories in the short medium and long terms physical risks from climate change include acute risks such as hurricanes floods and droughts as well as consequences of chronic changes in climate such as rising sea levels prolonged droughts and systemic changes to geographies and any resulting population migration for example physical risks could have adverse financial operational and other impacts on citi both directly on its business and operations and indirectly as a result of impacts to citis clients customers vendors and other counterparties these impacts can include destruction damage or impairment of owned or leased properties and other assets destruction or deterioration of the value of collateral such as real estate disruptions to business operations and supply chains and reduced availability or increase in the cost of insurance physical risks can also impact citis credit risk exposures for example in its mortgage and commercial real estate lending businesses transition risks may arise from changes in regulations or market preferences toward lowcarbon industries or sectors which in turn could have negative impacts on asset values results of operations or the reputations of citi and its customers and clients for example citis corporate credit exposures include oil and gas power and other industries that may experience reduced demand for carbonintensive products due to the transition to a lowcarbon economy failure to adequately consider transition risk in developing and executing on its business strategy could lead to a loss of market share lower revenues and higher credit costs transition risks also include potential increased operational compliance and energy costs driven by government policies to promote decarbonization moreover increasing legislative and regulatory changes and uncertainties regarding climaterelated risk management and disclosures are likely to result in increased regulatory compliance credit reputational and other risks and costs for citi new regulations have been enacted andor are expected in several jurisdictions including the eus corporate sustainability reporting directive csrd the sec climate related disclosures that could require disclosure of climate related information and the state of californias legislation enacted in october requiring broad disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions and other climaterelated information largely beginning in in addition citi could face increased regulatory scrutiny and reputation and litigation risks as a result of its climate risk sustainability and other esgrelated commitments and disclosures even as some regulators seek to mandate additional disclosure of climaterelated information citis ability to comply with such requirements and conduct more robust climaterelated risk analyses may be hampered by lack of information and reliable data data on climaterelated risks is limited in availability often based on estimated or unverified figures collected and reported on a timelag and variable in quality modeling capabilities to analyze climaterelated risks and interconnections are improving but remain incomplete us and nonus banking regulators and others are increasingly focusing on the issue of climate risk at financial institutions both directly and with respect to their clients for example in october the frb fdic and occ jointly released principles that provide a highlevel framework for the safe and sound management of exposures to climaterelated financial risks including physical and transition risks for financial institutions with more than billion in assets additionally if citis response to climate change is perceived to be ineffective or insufficient or citi is unable to achieve its objectives or commitments relating to climate change its businesses reputation attractiveness to certain investors and efforts to recruit and retain employees may suffer for example citis approach to supporting client decarbonization in a gradual and orderly way while promoting energy security may lead to both continued exposure to carbonintensive activity and increased reputation risks from stakeholders with divergent points of view citi also faces antiesg challenges from certain us state and other governments that may impact its ability to conduct certain business within those jurisdictions for information on citis climate and other sustainability initiatives see climate change and net zero below for additional information on citis management of climate risk see managing global riskstrategic riskclimate risk below citis ability to utilize its dtas and thus reduce the negative impact of the dtas on citis regulatory capital will be driven by its ability to generate us taxable income at december citis net dtas were billion net of a valuation allowance of billion of which billion was deducted from citis cet1 capital under the us basel iii rules of this deducted amount billion related to net operating losses foreign tax credit and general business credit carryforwards with billion related to temporary differences in excess of the regulatory limitations reduced by billion of deferred tax liabilities primarily associated with goodwill and certain other intangible assets that were separately deducted from capital citis overall ability to realize its dtas will primarily be dependent upon citis ability to generate us taxable income in the relevant reversal periods failure to realize any portion of the net dtas would have a corresponding negative impact on citis net income and financial returns the accounting treatment for realization of dtas is complex and requires significant judgment and estimates regarding future taxable earnings in the jurisdictions in which the dtas arise and available tax planning strategies forecasts of future taxable earnings will depend upon various factors including among others macroeconomic conditions in addition any future increase in us corporate tax rates could result in an increase in citis dtas which may subject more of citis dtas to exclusion from regulatory capital citi has not been and does not expect to be subject to the base erosion antiabuse tax beat which if applicable to citi in any given year would have a significantly adverse effect on both citis net income and regulatory capital for additional information on citis dtas including ftcs see significant accounting policies and significant estimatesincome taxes below and notes and citis interpretation or application of the complex tax laws to which it is subject could differ from those of governmental authorities which could result in litigation or examinations and the payment of additional taxes penalties or interest citi is subject to various incomebased tax laws of the us and its states and municipalities as well as the numerous non us jurisdictions in which it operates these tax laws are inherently complex and citi must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these laws to its entities operations and businesses for example the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd pillar initiative contemplates a global minimum tax with respect to earnings in each country eu member states were required to adopt the oecd pillar rules in with an effective date of january unless an exception applied and other nonus countries have similarly adopted or are expected to adopt the rules under these rules citi will be required to pay a topup tax to the extent that citis effective tax rate in any given country is below beginning in countries that adopted the oecd pillar rules in can collect the topup tax only with respect to earnings of entities in their jurisdiction or subsidiaries of such entities beginning in all countries that have adopted the oecd pillar rules can collect a share of the topup tax owed with respect to any member of the pillar multinational group while citi does not currently expect the rules to have a material impact on its earnings many aspects of the application of the rules remain uncertain additionally citi is subject to litigation or examinations with us and nonus tax authorities regarding nonincome based tax matters while citi has appropriately reserved for such matters where there is a probable loss and has disclosed reasonably possible losses the outcome of the matters may be different than citis expectations citis interpretations or application of the tax laws including with respect to withholding stamp service and other nonincome taxes could differ from that of the relevant governmental taxing authority which could result in the requirement to pay additional taxes penalties or interest the reduction of certain tax benefits or the requirement to make adjustments to amounts recorded which could be material see note for additional information on litigation and examinations involving nonus tax authorities a deterioration in or failure to maintain citis co branding or private label credit card relationships could have a negative impact on citi citi has cobranding and private label relationships through its branded cards and retail services credit card businesses with various retailers and merchants whereby in the ordinary course of business citi issues credit cards to consumers including customers of the retailers or merchants the five largest relationships across both businesses in uspb constituted an aggregate of approximately of citis revenues in see us personal banking above citis cobranding and private label agreements often provide for shared economics between the parties and generally have a fixed term competition among card issuers including citi for these relationships is significant and citi may not be able to maintain such relationships on existing terms or at all citis cobranding and private label relationships could also be negatively impacted by among other things the general economic environment including the impacts of continued elevated interest rates and inflation and lower economic growth rates as well as a continuing risk of recession changes in consumer sentiment spending patterns and credit card usage behaviors a decline in sales and revenues partner store closures any reduction in air and business travel or other operational difficulties of the retailer or merchant early termination due to a contractual breach or exercise of other early termination right or other factors including bankruptcies liquidations restructurings consolidations or other similar events whether due to a challenging macroeconomic environment or otherwise these events particularly early termination and bankruptcies or liquidations could negatively impact the results of operations or financial condition of branded cards retail services or citi as a whole including as a result of loss of revenues increased expenses higher cost of credit impairment of purchased credit card relationships and contractrelated intangibles or other losses see note for information on citis credit card related intangibles generally the application of us resolution plan requirements may pose a greater risk of loss to citis debt and equity securities holders and citis inability in its resolution plan submissions to address any shortcomings or deficiencies or guidance could subject citi to more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on its growth activities or operations and could eventually require citi to divest assets or operations title i of the doddfrank act requires citi to prepare and submit a plan to the frb and the fdic for the orderly resolution of citigroup the bank holding company and its significant legal entities under the us bankruptcy code in the event of future material financial distress or failure under citis preferred single point of entry resolution plan strategy only citigroup the parent holding company would enter into bankruptcy while citigroups material legal entities as defined in the public section of its resolution plan which can be found on the frbs and fdics websites would remain operational outside of any resolution or insolvency proceedings as a result citigroups losses and any losses incurred by its material legal entity subsidiaries would be imposed first on holders of citigroups equity securities and thereafter on its unsecured creditors including holders of eligible longterm debt and other debt securities in addition a wholly owned direct subsidiary of citigroup serves as a resolution funding vehicle the ihc to which citigroup has transferred and has agreed to transfer on an ongoing basis certain assets the obligations of citigroup and of the ihc respectively under the amended and restated secured support agreement are secured on a senior basis by the assets of citigroup other than shares in subsidiaries of the parent company and certain other assets and the assets of the ihc as applicable as a result claims of the operating material legal entities against the assets of citigroup with respect to such secured assets are effectively senior to unsecured obligations of citigroup citis single point of entry resolution plan strategy and the obligations under the amended and restated secured support agreement may result in the recapitalization of andor provision of liquidity to citis operating material legal entities and the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings by citigroup at an earlier stage of financial stress than might otherwise occur without such mechanisms in place in line with the frbs tlac rule citigroups shareholders and unsecured creditorsincluding its unsecured longterm debt holderswould bear any losses resulting from citigroups bankruptcy accordingly any value realized by holders of its unsecured longterm debt may not be sufficient to repay the amounts owed to such debt holders in the event of a bankruptcy or other resolution proceeding of citigroup for additional information on citis single point of entry resolution plan strategy and the ihc and secured support agreement see managing global riskliquidity risk below on november the frb and fdic issued feedback on the resolution plans filed on july by the eight us gsibs including citi the frb and fdic identified one shortcoming but no deficiencies in citis resolution plan the shortcoming related to data integrity and data quality management issues specifically weaknesses in citis processes and practices for producing certain data that could materially impact its resolution capabilities if a shortcoming is not satisfactorily explained or addressed before or in the submission of the next resolution plan the shortcoming may be found to be a deficiency in the next resolution plan see discussion below citi submitted its resolution plan in june more generally data continues to be a subject of regulatory focus and citi continues to work on enhancing its data availability and quality under title i if the frb and the fdic jointly determine that citis resolution plan is not credible which although not defined is generally understood to mean the regulators do not believe the plan is feasible or would otherwise allow citi to be resolved in a way that protects systemically important functions without severe systemic disruption or would not facilitate an orderly resolution of citi under the us bankruptcy code and citi fails to resubmit a resolution plan that remedies any identified deficiencies citi could be subjected to more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on its growth activities or operations if within two years from the imposition of any such requirements or restrictions citi has still not remediated any identified deficiencies then citi could eventually be required to divest certain assets or operations any such restrictions or actions would negatively impact citis reputation market and investor perception operations and strategy citis performance and its ability to effectively execute its transformation and strategic and other initiatives could be negatively impacted if it is not able to hire and retain qualified employees citis performance and the performance of its individual businesses largely depend on the talents and efforts of its diverse and highly qualified colleagues specifically citis continued ability to compete in each of its lines of business to manage its businesses effectively and to execute its transformation and strategic and other initiatives including for example hiring front office colleagues to grow businesses or hiring colleagues to support citis transformation and strategic and other initiatives depends on its ability to attract new colleagues and to retain and motivate its existing colleagues if citi is unable to continue to attract retain and motivate highly qualified colleagues citis performance including its competitive position the execution of its transformation and strategic and other initiatives and its results of operations could be negatively impacted citis ability to attract retain and motivate colleagues depends on numerous factors some of which are outside of citis control for example the competition for talent continues to be particularly intense due to factors such as low unemployment and changes in worker expectations concerns and preferences including an increased demand for remote work options and other job flexibility also the banking industry generally is subject to more comprehensive regulation of employee compensation than other industries including deferral and clawback requirements for incentive compensation which can make it unusually challenging for citi to compete in labor markets against businesses including for example technology companies that are not subject to such regulation in addition in citi announced plans to reduce management layers from to a median of eight as part of organizational simplification initiatives that also involve significant reductions in functional roles which could also impact its ability to attract and retain colleagues other factors that could impact its ability to attract retain and motivate colleagues include among other things citis presence in a particular market or region the professional and development opportunities its reputation and its diversity for information on citis colleagues and workforce management see human capital resources and management below citi faces increased competitive challenges including from financial services and other companies and emerging technologies citi operates in an increasingly evolving and competitive business environment which includes both financial and non financial services firms such as traditional banks online banks private credit and financial technology companies and others these companies compete on the basis of among other factors size reach quality and type of products and services offered price technology and reputation certain competitors may be subject to different and in some cases less stringent legal and regulatory requirements whether due to size jurisdiction entity type or other factors placing citi at a competitive disadvantage for example citi competes with other financial services companies in the us and globally that have grown rapidly over the last several years or have developed and introduced new products and services potential mergers and acquisitions involving traditional financial services companies such as regional banks or credit card issuers as well as networks and merchant acquirers may also increase competition and impact citis ability to offer competitive pricing and rewards non traditional financial services firms such as private credit and financial technology companies are less regulated and continue to expand their offerings of services traditionally provided by financial institutions the growth of certain of these competitors has increased market and counterparty credit risks particularly in a more challenging macroeconomic environment see the risk factor on credit and concentrations of risk below in addition emerging technologies have the potential to intensify competition and accelerate disruption in the financial services industry for example despite difficulties and turmoil faced by the digital asset market in recent years clients and investors have exhibited a sustained interest in digital assets financial services firms and other market participants have begun to offer services related to those assets citi may not be able to provide the same or similar services for legal or regulatory reasons which may be exacerbated by rapidly evolving and conflicting regulatory requirements and due to increased compliance and other risks further changes in the payments space eg instant and 24x7 payments are accelerating and as a result certain of citis products and services could become less competitive increased competition and emerging technologies have required and could require citi to change or adapt its products and services as well as invest in and develop related infrastructure to attract and retain customers or clients or to compete more effectively with competitors including new market entrants simultaneously as citi develops new products and services leveraging emerging technologies new risks may emerge that if not designed and governed adequately may result in control gaps and in citi operating outside of its risk appetite for example failure to strategically embrace the potential of artificial intelligence ai may result in a competitive disadvantage to citi at the same time as a new technology use of ai without sufficient controls governance and risk management may result in increased risks across all of citis risk categories as another example instant and 24x7 payments products could be accompanied by challenges to forecasting and managing liquidity as well as increased operational and compliance risks moreover citi relies on third parties to support certain of its product and service offerings which may put citi at a disadvantage to competitors who may directly offer a broader array of products and services also citis businesses results of operations and reputation may suffer if any third party is unable to provide adequate support for such product and service offerings whether due to operational incidents or otherwise see the operational processes and systems cybersecurity and emerging markets risk factors below to the extent that citi is not able to compete effectively with financial services companies including private credit and financial technology companies and nonfinancial services firms citi could be placed at a competitive disadvantage which could result in loss of customers and market share and its businesses results of operations and financial condition could suffer for additional information on citis competitors see the cobrand and private label cards and qualified colleagues risk factors above and supervision regulation and othercompetition below operational risks a failure or disruption of citis operational processes or systems could negatively impact its reputation customers clients businesses or results of operations and financial condition citis global operations rely heavily on its technology systems and infrastructure including the accurate timely and secure processing management storage and transmission of data including confidential transactions and other information as well as the monitoring of a substantial amount of data and complex transactions in real time citi obtains and stores an extensive amount of personal and clientspecific information for its consumer and institutional customers and clients and must accurately record and reflect their account transactions citis operations must also comply with complex and evolving laws regulations and heightened regulatory expectations in the countries in which it operates see the implementation and interpretation of regulatory changes and legal proceedings risk factors below with the evolving proliferation of new technologies and the increasing use of the internet mobile devices and cloud services to conduct financial transactions and customers and clients increasing use of online banking and trading systems and other platforms large global financial institutions such as citi have been and will continue to be subject to an everincreasing risk of operational loss failure or disruption although citi has continued to upgrade its technology including systems to automate processes and gain efficiencies operational incidents are unpredictable and can arise from numerous sources not all of which are fully within citis control these include among others operational or execution failures or deficiencies by third parties including third parties that provide products or services to citi eg cloud service providers other market participants or those that otherwise have an ongoing partnership or business relationship with citi deficiencies in processes or controls inadequate management of data governance practices data controls and monitoring mechanisms that may adversely impact internal or external reporting and decisionmaking cyber or information security incidents see the cybersecurity risk factor below human error such as manual transaction processing errors eg erroneous payments to lenders or manual errors by traders that cause system and market disruptions or losses which can be exacerbated by staffing challenges and processing backlogs fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties insufficient or limited straightthrough processing between legacy or bespoke systems and any failure to design and effectively operate controls that mitigate operational risks associated with those legacy or bespoke systems leading to potential risk of errors and operating losses accidental system or technological failure electrical or telecommunication outages failures of or cyber incidents involving computer servers or infrastructure including cloud services or other similar losses or damage to citis property or assets see also the climate change risk factor above for example operational incidents can arise as a result of failures by third parties with which citi does business such as failures by internet mobile technology and cloud service providers or other vendors to adequately follow procedures or processes safeguard their systems or prevent system disruptions or cyberattacks failure by citi to develop implement and operate a thirdparty risk management program commensurate with the level of risk complexity and nature of its thirdparty relationships can also result in operational incidents in addition citi has experienced and could experience further losses associated with manual transaction processing errors including erroneous payments to lenders or manual errors by citi traders that cause system and market disruptions and losses for citi and its clients irrespective of the sophistication of the technology utilized by citi there will always be some room for human and other errors in view of the large transactions in which citi engages such errors could result in significant losses while citi has change management processes in place to appropriately upgrade its operational processes and systems to ensure that any changes introduced do not adversely impact security and operational continuity such change management can fail or be ineffective furthermore when citi introduces new products systems or processes new operational risks that may arise from those changes may not be identified or adequate controls to mitigate the identified risks may not be appropriately implemented or operate as designed incidents that impact information security technology operations or other operational processes may cause disruptions andor malfunctions within citis businesses eg the temporary loss of availability of citis online banking system or mobile banking platform as well as the operations of its clients customers or other third parties in addition operational incidents could involve the failure or ineffectiveness of internal processes or controls given citis global footprint and the high volume of transactions processed by citi certain failures errors or actions may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and rectified which would further increase the consequences and costs operational incidents could result in financial losses and other costs as well as misappropriation corruption or loss of confidential and other information or assets which could significantly negatively impact citis reputation customers clients businesses or results of operations and financial condition cyberrelated and other operational incidents can also result in legal and regulatory actions or proceedings fines and other costs see the legal and regulatory proceedings risk factor below for information on citis management of operational risk see managing global riskoperational risk below citis and third parties computer systems and networks will continue to be susceptible to an increasing risk of continually evolving sophisticated cybersecurity incidents that could result in the theft loss nonavailability misuse or disclosure of confidential client or customer information damage to citis reputation additional costs to citi regulatory penalties legal exposure and financial losses citis computer systems software and networks are subject to ongoing attempted cyberattacks such as unauthorized access loss or destruction of data including confidential client information account takeovers disruptions of service phishing malware ransomware computer viruses or other malicious code and other similar events these threats can arise from external parties including cyber criminals cyber terrorists hacktivists individuals or groups using cyberattacks to promote a political or social agenda and nationstate actors as well as insiders who knowingly or unknowingly engage in or enable malicious cyber activities citi develops its own software and relies on thirdparty applications and software which are susceptible to vulnerability exploitations software leveraged in financial services and other industries continues to be impacted by an increasing number of zeroday vulnerabilities thus increasing inherent cyber risk to citi the increasing use of mobile and other digital banking platforms and services cloud technologies and connectivity solutions to facilitate remote working for citis employees all increase citis exposure to cybersecurity risks citi is also susceptible to cyberattacks given among other things its size and scale highprofile brand global footprint and prominent role in the financial system as well as the ongoing winddown of its businesses in russia see the macroeconomic and geopolitical risk factor above and managing global risk other riskscountry riskrussia below additionally citi continues to operate in multiple jurisdictions in the midst of geopolitical unrest including active conflicts in ukraine and the middle east which could expose citi to heightened risk of insider threat politically motivated hacktivism or other cyber threats citi continues to experience increased exposure to cyberattacks through third parties in part because financial institutions are becoming increasingly interconnected with central agents exchanges and clearing houses third parties with which citi does business as well as retailers and other third parties with which citis customers do business and any such third parties downstream service providers also pose cybersecurity risks particularly where activities of customers are beyond citis security and control systems for example citi outsources certain functions such as processing customer credit card transactions uploading content on customerfacing websites and developing software for new products and services these relationships allow for the storage and processing of customer information by thirdparty hosting of or access to citi websites this could lead to compromise or the potential to introduce vulnerable or malicious code resulting in security breaches or business disruptions impacting citi customers employees or operations while many of citis agreements with third parties include indemnification provisions citi may not be able to recover sufficiently or at all under these provisions to adequately offset any losses and other adverse impacts citi may incur from thirdparty cyber incidents citi and some of its thirdparty partners have been subjected to attempted and sometimes successful cyberattacks over the last several years including i denial of service attacks which attempt to interrupt service to clients and customers ii hacking and malicious software installations intended to gain unauthorized access to information systems or to disrupt those systems andor impact availability or privacy of confidential data with objectives including but not limited to extortion payments or causing reputational damage iii data breaches due to unauthorized access to customer account or other data and iv malicious software attacks on client systems in attempts to gain unauthorized access to citi systems or client data under the guise of normal client transactions while citis monitoring and protection services have historically generally succeeded in detecting thwarting andor responding to attacks targeting its systems before they become significant certain past incidents resulted in limited losses as well as increases in expenditures to monitor against the threat of similar future cyber incidents there can be no assurance that such cyber incidents will not occur again and they could occur more frequently via novel tactics including leveraging of tools made possible by emerging technologies and on a more significant scale despite the significant resources citi allocates to implement maintain monitor and regularly upgrade its systems and networks with measures such as intrusion detection and prevention systems and firewalls to safeguard critical business applications there is no guarantee that these measures or any other measures can provide sufficient security because the techniques used to initiate cyberattacks change frequently or in some cases are not recognized until launched or even later citi may be unable to implement effective preventive measures or otherwise proactively address these methods in addition cyber threats and cyberattack techniques change develop and evolve rapidly including from emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence cloud computing and quantum computing given the frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks the determination of the severity and potential impact of a cyber incident may not become apparent for a substantial period of time following detection of the incident also while citi strives to implement measures to reduce the exposure resulting from outsourcing risks such as performing security control assessments of thirdparty vendors and limiting thirdparty access to the least privileged level necessary to perform job functions these measures cannot prevent all thirdparty related cyberattacks or data breaches in addition the risk of insider threat may be elevated in the near term due to citis overall simplification initiatives including streamlining its global staff functions cyber incidents can result in the disclosure of personal confidential or proprietary customer client or employee information damage to citis reputation with its clients other counterparties and the market customer dissatisfaction and additional costs to citi including expenses such as repairing or replacing systems replacing customer payment cards credit monitoring or adding new personnel or protection technologies cyber incidents can also result in regulatory penalties loss of revenues deposit flight exposure to litigation and other financial losses including loss of funds to both citi and its clients and customers and disruption to citis operational systems see the operational processes and systems risk factor above moreover the increasing risk of cyber incidents has resulted in increased legislative and regulatory action on cybersecurity including among other things scrutiny of firms cybersecurity protection services laws and regulations to enhance protection of consumers personal data and mandated disclosure on cybersecurity matters for example in july the sec finalized new rules requiring timely disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents as well as other annual cyberrelated disclosures see managing global riskoperational riskcybersecurity risk below while citi maintains insurance coverage that may subject to policy terms and conditions including significant self insured deductibles cover certain aspects of cyber risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses and may not take into account reputational harm the costs of which are impossible to quantify for additional information about citis management of cybersecurity risk see managing global riskoperational riskcybersecurity risk below changes or errors in accounting assumptions judgments or estimates or the application of certain accounting principles could result in significant losses or other adverse impacts us gaap requires citi to use certain assumptions judgments and estimates in preparing its financial statements including among other items the estimate of the acl reserves related to litigation regulatory and tax matters valuation of dtas the fair values of certain assets and liabilities and the assessment of goodwill and other assets for impairment these assumptions judgments and estimates are inherently limited because they involve techniques including the use of historical data in many circumstances that cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome in the markets in which citi operates nor can they anticipate the specifics and timing of such outcomes for example many models used by citi include assumptions about correlation or lack thereof among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators that may not hold in times of market stress limited liquidity or other unforeseen circumstances if citis assumptions judgments or estimates underlying its financial statements are incorrect or differ from actual or subsequent events citi could experience unexpected losses or other adverse impacts some of which could be significant citi could also experience declines in its stock price be subject to legal and regulatory proceedings and incur fines and other losses for additional information on the key areas for which assumptions and estimates are used in preparing citis financial statements see significant accounting policies and significant estimates below and notes and for example the cecl methodology requires that citi provide reserves for a current estimate of lifetime expected credit losses for its loan portfolios and other financial assets as applicable at the time those assets are originated or acquired this estimate is adjusted each period for changes in expected lifetime credit losses citis acl estimate depends upon its cecl models and assumptions forecasted macroeconomic conditions including among other things the us unemployment rate and us inflationadjusted gross domestic product real gdp and the credit indicators composition and other characteristics of citis loan portfolios and other applicable financial assets these model assumptions and forecasted macroeconomic conditions will change over time resulting in variability in citis acl and thus impact its results of operations and financial condition as well as regulatory capital due to the cecl phasein see the capital return risk factor above moreover citi has incurred losses related to its foreign operations that are reported in the cta components of accumulated other comprehensive income loss aoci in accordance with us gaap a sale substantial liquidation or other deconsolidation event of any foreign operations such as those related to citis remaining divestitures or legacy businesses would result in reclassification of any foreign cta component of aoci related to that foreign operation including related hedges and taxes into citis earnings for example citi could incur a significant loss on sale due to cta losses related to any signing of a sale agreement for its remaining consumer banking divestitures see the capital return and continued investments risk factors above the majority of these losses would be regulatory capital neutral at closing for additional information on citis accounting policy for foreign currency translation and its foreign cta components of aoci see notes and changes to financial accounting and reporting standards or interpretations could have a material impact on how citi records and reports its financial condition and results of operations periodically the financial accounting standards board fasb issues financial accounting and reporting standards that govern key aspects of citis financial statements or interpretations thereof when those standards become effective including those areas where citi is required to make assumptions or estimates changes to financial accounting or reporting standards or interpretations whether promulgated or required by the fasb the sec us banking regulators or others could present operational challenges and could also require citi to change certain of the assumptions or estimates it previously used in preparing its financial statements which could negatively impact how it records and reports its financial condition and results of operations generally andor with respect to particular businesses see note for additional information on citis accounting policies and changes in accounting including the expected impacts on citis results of operations and financial condition if citis risk management and other processes strategies or models are deficient or ineffective citi may incur significant losses and its regulatory capital and capital ratios could be negatively impacted citi utilizes a broad and diversified set of risk management and other processes and strategies including the use of models in analyzing and monitoring the various risks citi assumes in conducting its activities for example citi uses models as part of its comprehensive stress testing initiatives across the company citi also relies on data to aggregate assess and manage various risk exposures management of these risks and the reliability of the data are made more challenging within a large global financial institution such as citi particularly due to complex diverse and rapidly changing financial markets and conditions in which citi operates unexpected losses can result from untimely inaccurate or incomplete processes and data as discussed below in october citigroup and citibank entered into consent orders with the frb and occ that require citigroup and citibank to make improvements in various aspects of enterprisewide risk management compliance data quality management and governance and internal controls see citis consent order compliance above and the legal and regulatory proceedings risk factor below citis risk management and other processes strategies and models are inherently limited because they involve techniques including the use of historical data in many circumstances assumptions and judgments that cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome in the markets in which citi operates particularly given various macroeconomic geopolitical and other challenges and uncertainties see the macroeconomic challenges and uncertainties risk factor above nor can they anticipate the specifics and timing of such outcomes for example many models used by citi include assumptions about correlation or lack thereof among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators that may not necessarily hold in times of market stress limited liquidity or other unforeseen circumstances or identify changes in markets or client behaviors not yet inherent in historical data citi could incur significant losses receive negative regulatory evaluation or examination findings or be subject to additional enforcement actions and its regulatory capital capital ratios and ability to return capital could be negatively impacted if citis risk management and other processes including its ability to manage and aggregate data in a timely and accurate manner strategies or models are deficient or ineffective for additional information see the capital return risk factor above and the heightened regulatory scrutiny and ongoing interpretation of regulatory changes risk factor below such deficiencies or ineffectiveness could also result in inaccurate financial regulatory or risk reporting moreover citis basel iii regulatory capital models including its credit market and operational risk models currently remain subject to ongoing regulatory review and approval which may result in refinements modifications or enhancements required or otherwise to these models citi is required to notify and obtain preapproval from both the occ and frb prior to implementing certain riskweighted asset treatments as well as certain model changes resulting in a more challenging environment within which citi must operate in managing its riskweighted assets modifications or requirements resulting from these ongoing reviews as well as any future changes or guidance provided by the us banking regulators regarding the us regulatory capital framework applicable to citi including but not limited to potential revisions to the us basel iii rules known as the basel iii endgame for information about the basel iii endgame see the capital return risk factor and capital resources regulatory capital standards developments above have resulted in and could continue to result in significant changes to citis riskweighted assets these changes can negatively impact citis capital ratios and its ability to meet its regulatory capital requirements credit risks credit risk and concentrations of risk can increase the potential for citi to incur significant losses citi has credit exposures to consumer corporate and public sector borrowers and other counterparties in the us and various countries and jurisdictions globally including endof period consumer loans of billion and endofperiod corporate loans of billion at december for additional information on citis corporate and consumer loan portfolios see managing global riskcorporate credit and consumer credit below a default by or a significant downgrade in the credit ratings of a borrower or other counterparty or a decline in the credit quality or value of any underlying collateral exposes citi to credit risk despite citis target client strategy various macroeconomic geopolitical market and other factors among other things can increase citis credit risk and credit costs particularly for vulnerable sectors industries or countries see the macroeconomic challenges and uncertainties and co branding and private label credit card risk factors above and the emerging markets risk factor below for example a weakening of economic conditions can adversely affect borrowers ability to repay their obligations as well as result in citi being unable to liquidate the collateral it holds or forced to liquidate the collateral at prices that do not cover the full amount owed to citi citi is also a member of various central clearing counterparties and could incur financial losses as a result of defaults by other clearing members due to the requirements of clearing members to share losses additionally due to the interconnectedness among financial institutions concerns about the creditworthiness of or defaults by a financial institution could spread to other financial market participants and result in marketwide losses and disruption for example the failure of regional banks and other banking stresses in the first half of resulted in market volatility across the financial sector while citi provides reserves for expected losses for its credit exposures as applicable such reserves are subject to judgments and estimates that could be incorrect or differ from actual future events under the cecl accounting standard the acl reflects expected losses which has resulted in and could lead to additional volatility in the allowance and the provision for credit losses including provisions for loans and unfunded lending commitments and acl builds for other assets as forecasts of economic conditions change for additional information see the incorrect assumptions or estimates and changes to financial accounting and reporting standards risk factors above

respective businesss results of operations above managing global risk credit risk and managing global riskother risks country risk below and notes and concentrations of risk to clients or counterparties engaged in the same or related industries or doing business in a particular geography or to a particular product or asset class especially credit and market risks can also increase citis risk of significant losses for example citi routinely executes a high volume of securities trading derivative and foreign exchange transactions with nonus sovereigns and with counterparties in the financial services industry including banks insurance companies investment banks governments central banks and other financial institutions moreover citi has indemnification obligations in connection with various transactions that expose it to concentrations of risk including credit risk from hedging or reinsurance arrangements related to those obligations see note a rapid deterioration of a large borrower or other counterparty or within a sector or country in which citi has large exposures or indemnifications or unexpected market dislocations could lead to concerns about the creditworthiness of other borrowers or counterparties in a certain geography and in related or dependent industries and such conditions could cause citi to incur significant losses liquidity risks citis businesses results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted if it does not effectively manage its liquidity as a large global financial institution adequate liquidity and sources of funding are essential to citis businesses citis liquidity sources of funding and costs of funding can be significantly and negatively impacted by factors it cannot control such as general disruptions in the financial markets eg the failure of regional banks and other banking stresses in the first half of changes in fiscal and monetary policies and regulatory requirements negative investor perceptions of citis creditworthiness deposit outflows or unfavorable changes in deposit mix unexpected increases in cash or collateral requirements credit ratings and the consequent inability to monetize available liquidity resources in addition citi competes with other banks and financial institutions for both institutional and consumer deposits which represent citis most stable and lowest cost source of long term funding the competition for deposits has continued to increase including as a result of quantitative tightening by central banks the current higher interest rate environment and fixed income alternatives for customer funds further citis costs to obtain and access wholesale funding are directly related to changes in interest and currency exchange rates and its credit spreads changes in citis credit spreads are driven by both external market factors and factors specific to citi such as negative views by investors of the financial services industry or citis financial prospects and can be highly volatile for additional information on citis primary sources of funding see managing global risk liquidity risk below citis ability to obtain funding may be impaired and its cost of funding could also increase if other market participants are seeking to access the markets at the same time or to a greater extent than expected or if market appetite for corporate debt securities declines as is likely to occur in a liquidity stress event or other market crisis citis ability to sell assets may also be impaired if other market participants are seeking to sell similar assets at the same time or a liquid market does not exist for such assets additionally unexpected changes in client needs due to idiosyncratic events or market conditions could result in greater than expected drawdowns from offbalance sheet committed facilities a sudden drop in market liquidity could also cause a temporary or protracted dislocation of capital markets activity in addition clearing organizations central banks clients and financial institutions with which citi interacts may exercise the right to require additional collateral during challenging market conditions which could further impair citis liquidity if citi fails to effectively manage its liquidity its businesses results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted limitations on the payments that citigroup inc receives from its subsidiaries could also impact its liquidity as a holding company citigroup inc relies on interest dividends distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund dividends as well as to satisfy its debt and other obligations several of citis us and nonus subsidiaries are or may be subject to capital adequacy or other liquidity regulatory or contractual restrictions on their ability to provide such payments including any local regulatory stress test requirements and interaffiliate arrangements entered into in connection with citigroup incs resolution plan citigroup incs brokerdealer and bank subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to lend or transact with affiliates as well as restrictions on their ability to use funds deposited with them in brokerage or bank accounts to fund their businesses a bank holding company is also required by law to act as a source of financial and managerial strength for its subsidiary banks as a result the frb may require citigroup inc to commit resources to its subsidiary banks even if doing so is not otherwise in the interests of citigroup inc or its shareholders or creditors reducing the amount of funds available to meet its obligations a ratings downgrade could adversely impact citis funding and liquidity the credit rating agencies such as fitch ratings moodys investors service and sp global ratings continuously evaluate citi and certain of its subsidiaries their ratings of citi and its rated subsidiaries longterm debt and shortterm obligations are based on firmspecific factors including the financial strength of citi and such subsidiaries as well as factors that are not entirely within the control of citi and its subsidiaries such as the agencies proprietary rating methodologies and assumptions potential impact from negative actions on us sovereign ratings and conditions affecting the financial services industry and markets generally citi and its subsidiaries may not be able to maintain their current respective ratings and outlooks rating downgrades could negatively impact citi and its rated subsidiaries ability to access the capital markets and other sources of funds as well as increase credit spreads and the costs of those funds a ratings downgrade could also have a negative impact on citi and its rated subsidiaries ability to obtain funding and liquidity due to reduced funding capacity and the impact from derivative triggers which could require citi and its rated subsidiaries to meet cash obligations and collateral requirements or permit counterparties to terminate certain contracts in addition a ratings downgrade could have a negative impact on other funding sources such as secured financing and other margined transactions for which there may be no explicit triggers furthermore a credit ratings downgrade could have impacts that may not be currently known to citi or are not possible to quantify some of citis counterparties and clients could have ratings limitations on their permissible counterparties of which citi may or may not be aware certain of citis corporate customers and trading counterparties among other clients could reevaluate their business relationships with citi and limit the trading of certain market instruments and limit or withdraw deposits placed with citi in response to ratings downgrades changes in customer and counterparty behavior could impact not only citis funding and liquidity but also the results of operations of certain citi businesses for additional information on the potential impact of a reduction in citis or citibanks credit ratings see managing global riskliquidity risk below compliance risks significantly heightened regulatory expectations and scrutiny in the us and globally and ongoing interpretation and implementation of regulatory and legislative requirements and changes have increased citis compliance regulatory and other risks and costs large financial institutions such as citi face significantly heightened regulatory expectations and scrutiny in the us and globally including with respect to among other things governance infrastructure data and risk management practices and controls these regulatory expectations extend to their employees and agents and also include among other things those related to customer and client protection market practices antimoney laundering increasingly complex sanctions and disclosure regimes and various regulatory reporting requirements us financial institutions also face increased expectations and scrutiny in the wake of the failures of several regional banks and other banking stresses in the first half of in addition citi is continually required to interpret and implement extensive and frequently changing regulatory and legislative requirements in the us and other jurisdictions in which it does business which may overlap or conflict across jurisdictions resulting in substantial compliance regulatory and other risks and costs a failure to comply with these expectations and requirements even if inadvertent or resolve any identified deficiencies in a timely and sufficiently satisfactory manner to regulators could result in increased regulatory oversight material restrictions including among others imposition of additional capital buffers and limitations on capital distributions enforcement proceedings penalties and fines see the capital return risk factor above and legal and regulatory proceedings risk factor below over the past several years citi has been required to implement a large number of regulatory and legislative changes including new regulatory or legislative requirements or regimes across its businesses and functions and these changes continue the changes themselves may be complex and subject to interpretation and result in changes to citis businesses in addition the changes require continued substantial technology and other investments in some cases citis implementation of a regulatory or legislative requirement is occurring simultaneously with changing or conflicting regulatory guidance from multiple jurisdictions including various us states and regulators legal challenges or legislative action to modify or repeal existing rules or enact new rules examples of regulatory or legislative changes that have resulted in increased compliance risks and costs include i the us regulatory capital framework and requirements which have continued to evolve see the capital return risk factor and capital resources above ii various laws relating to the limitation of crossborder data movement andor collection and use of customer information including data localization and protection and privacy laws which also can conflict with or increase compliance complexity with respect to other laws including antimoney laundering laws and iii the eus corporate sustainability reporting directive which may overlap but also diverge from climaterelated disclosure requirements expected to come into effect in other jurisdictions including in the us in addition certain us regulatory agencies and states and nonus authorities have prioritized issues of social economic and racial justice and are in the process of considering ways in which these issues can be mitigated including through rulemaking supervision and other means even while certain us state and other governments are pursuing and signaling challenges that may conflict with corporate esg initiatives citi is subject to extensive legal and regulatory proceedings examinations investigations consent orders and related compliance efforts and other inquiries that could result in large monetary penalties supervisory or enforcement orders business restrictions limitations on dividends changes to directors andor officers and collateral consequences arising from such outcomes at any given time citi is a party to a significant number of legal and regulatory proceedings and is subject to numerous governmental and regulatory examinations additionally citi remains subject to governmental and regulatory investigations consent orders see discussion below and related compliance efforts and other inquiries citi could also be subject to enforcement proceedings and negative regulatory evaluation or examination findings not only because of violations of laws and regulations but also due to failures as determined by its regulators to have adequate policies and procedures or to remedy deficiencies on a timely basis see also the capital return and resolution plan risk factors above citis regulators have broad powers and discretion under their prudential and supervisory authority and have pursued active inspection and investigatory oversight as previously disclosed the october frb and occ consent orders require citigroup and citibank to implement extensive targeted action plans and submit quarterly progress reports on a timely and sufficient basis detailing the results and status of improvements relating principally to various aspects of enterprisewide risk management compliance data quality management and governance and internal controls these improvements will result in continued significant investments by citi during and beyond as an essential part of citis broader transformation efforts to enhance its risk controls data and finance infrastructure and compliance there can be no assurance that such improvements will be implemented in a manner satisfactory in both timing and sufficiency to the frb and occ although there are no restrictions on citis ability to serve its clients the occ consent order requires citibank to obtain prior approval of any significant new acquisition including any portfolio or business acquisition excluding ordinary course transactions moreover the occ consent order provides that the occ has the right to assess future civil money penalties or take other supervisory andor enforcement actions such actions by the occ could include imposing business restrictions including possible limitations on the declaration or payment of dividends and changes in directors andor senior executive officers more generally the occ andor the frb could take additional enforcement or other actions if the regulatory agency believes that citi has not met regulatory expectations regarding compliance with the consent orders for additional information regarding the consent orders see citis consent order compliance above the global judicial regulatory and political environment has generally been challenging for large financial institutions which have been subject to increased regulatory scrutiny the complexity of the federal and state regulatory and enforcement regimes in the us coupled with the global scope of citis operations also means that a single event or issue may give rise to a large number of overlapping investigations and regulatory proceedings either by multiple federal and state agencies and authorities in the us or by multiple regulators and other governmental entities in foreign jurisdictions as well as multiple civil litigation claims in multiple jurisdictions violations of law by other financial institutions may also result in regulatory scrutiny of citi responding to regulatory inquiries and proceedings can be time consuming and costly and divert management attention from citis businesses us and nonus regulators have been increasingly focused on the culture of financial services firms including citi as well as conduct risk a term used to describe the risks associated with behavior by employees and agents including third parties that could harm clients customers employees or the integrity of the markets such as improperly creating selling marketing or managing products and services or improper incentive compensation programs with respect thereto failures to safeguard a partys personal information or failures to identify and manage conflicts of interest in addition to the greater focus on conduct risk the general heightened scrutiny and expectations from regulators could lead to investigations and other inquiries as well as remediation requirements regulatory restrictions structural changes more regulatory or other enforcement proceedings civil litigation and higher compliance and other risks and costs for additional information see the capital return and heightened regulatory scrutiny and ongoing interpretation of regulatory changes risk factors above further while citi takes numerous steps to prevent and detect conduct by employees and agents that could potentially harm clients customers employees or the integrity of the markets such behavior may not always be deterred or prevented moreover the severity of the remedies sought in legal and regulatory proceedings to which citi is subject has remained elevated for example us and certain nonus governmental entities have increasingly brought criminal actions against or have sought and obtained criminal guilty pleas or deferred prosecution agreements from financial institutions and individual employees these types of actions by us and other governments may in the future have significant collateral consequences for citi including loss of customers and business operational loss and the inability to offer certain products or services andor operate certain businesses citi may be required to accept or be subject to similar types of criminal remedies consent orders sanctions substantial fines and penalties remediation and other financial costs or other requirements in the future including for matters or practices not yet known to citi any of which could materially and negatively affect citis businesses business practices financial condition or results of operations require material changes in citis operations or cause citi substantial reputational harm additionally many large claimsboth private civil and regulatoryasserted against citi are highly complex slow to develop and may involve novel or untested legal theories the outcome of such proceedings is difficult to predict or estimate until late in the proceedings although citi establishes accruals for its legal and regulatory matters according to accounting requirements citis estimates of and changes to these accruals involve significant judgment and may be subject to significant uncertainty and the amount of loss ultimately incurred in relation to those matters may be substantially higher than the amounts accrued see the incorrect assumptions or estimates risk factor above in addition certain settlements are subject to court approval and may not be approved for further information on citis legal and regulatory proceedings see note other risks citis emerging markets presence subjects it to various risks as well as increased compliance and regulatory risks and costs during emerging markets revenues accounted for approximately of citis total revenues citi generally defines emerging markets as countries in latin america asia other than japan australia and new zealand and central and eastern europe the middle east and africa citis presence in the emerging markets subjects it to various risks emerging market risks include among others limitations or unavailability of hedges on foreign investments foreign currency volatility including devaluations and strength in the us dollar sustained elevated interest rates and quantitative tightening elevated inflation and hyperinflation foreign exchange controls including an inability to access indirect foreign exchange mechanisms macroeconomic geopolitical and domestic political challenges uncertainties and volatility including with respect to russia see the macroeconomic and geopolitical risk factor above and managing global

commodity prices election outcomes regulatory changes including potential conflicts among regulations with other jurisdictions where citi does business limitations on foreign investment sociopolitical instability civil unrest crime corruption and fraud nationalization or loss of licenses potential criminal charges closure of branches or subsidiaries and confiscation of assets and these risks can be exacerbated in the event of a deterioration in the relationship between the us and an emerging market country for example citi operates in several countries that have or have had in the past strict capital controls currency controls andor sanctions such as argentina and russia that limit its ability to convert local currency into us dollars and or transfer funds outside of those countries for instance citi may need to record additional translation losses due to currency controls in argentina see managing global risk other riskscountry riskargentina below moreover citi may need to record additional reserves for expected losses for its credit exposures based on the transfer risk associated with exposures outside the us driven by safety and soundness considerations under us banking law see managing global riskother riskscountry risk argentina and russia and significant accounting policies and significant estimates below in addition political turmoil and instability geopolitical challenges tensions and conflicts including those related to russias war in ukraine as well as a persistent andor escalating conflict in the middle east terrorism and other instabilities have occurred in various regions and emerging market countries across the globe which impact citis businesses results of operations and financial conditions in affected countries and have required and may continue
