interest payments under the terms of the loan structure citis corporate nonaccrual loans were billion billion and billion as of december september and december respectively consumer nonaccrual status is generally based on aging ie the borrower has fallen behind on payments consumer mortgage loans other than federal housing administration fhainsured loans are classified as nonaccrual within days of notification that the borrower has filed for bankruptcy in addition home equity loans are classified as nonaccrual if the related residential first mortgage loan is days or more past due us branded cards and retail services are not included because under industry standards credit card loans accrue interest until such loans are charged off which typically occurs at days of contractual delinquency nonaccrual loans the table below summarizes citigroups nonaccrual loans as of the periods indicated nonaccrual loans may still be current on interest payments in situations where citi reasonably expects that only a portion of the principal owed will ultimately be collected all payments received are reflected as a reduction of principal and not as interest income for all other nonaccrual loans

chargeoff liquidity risk overview adequate and diverse sources of funding and liquidity are essential to citis businesses funding and liquidity risks arise from several factors many of which are mostly or entirely outside of citis control such as disruptions in the financial markets changes in key funding sources credit spreads changes in citis credit ratings and macroeconomic geopolitical and other conditions for additional information see risk factorsliquidity risks above citis funding and liquidity management objectives are aimed at i funding its existing asset base ii growing its core businesses iii maintaining sufficient liquidity structured appropriately so that citi can operate under a variety of adverse circumstances including potential companyspecific andor market liquidity events in varying durations and severity and iv satisfying regulatory requirements including but not limited to those related to resolution planning see resolution plan and total loss absorbing capacity tlac below citigroups primary liquidity objectives are established by entity and in aggregate across two major categories citibank including citibank europe plc citibank singapore ltd and citibank hong kong ltd and citis nonbank and other entities including the parent holding company citigroup inc citis primary intermediate holding company citicorp llc citis brokerdealer subsidiaries including citigroup global markets inc citigroup global markets limited and citigroup global markets japan inc and other bank and nonbank subsidiaries that are consolidated into citigroup including citibanamex at an aggregate citigroup level citis goal is to maintain sufficient funding in amount and tenor to fully fund customer assets and to provide an appropriate amount of cash and high quality liquid assets as discussed below even in times of stress in order to meet its payment obligations as they come due the liquidity risk management framework provides that in addition to the aggregate requirements certain entities be selfsufficient or net providers of liquidity including in conditions established under their designated stress tests citis primary funding sources include i corporate and consumer deposits via citis bank subsidiaries including citibank na citibank ii longterm debt primarily senior and subordinated debt mainly issued by citigroup inc as the parent and citibank and iii stockholders equity these sources may be supplemented by shortterm borrowings primarily in the form of secured funding transactions citis funding and liquidity framework working in concert with overall assetliability management helps ensure that there is sufficient liquidity and tenor in the overall liability structure including funding products of the company relative to the liquidity requirements of citis assets this reduces the risk that liabilities will become due before assets mature or are monetized the company holds excess liquidity primarily in the form of highquality liquid assets hqla as presented in the table below citis liquidity is managed centrally by corporate treasury in conjunction with regional and incountry treasurers with oversight provided by independent risk management and various asset liability committees alcos at the individual entity region country and business levels pursuant to this approach citis hqla are managed with emphasis on assetliability management and entitylevel liquidity adequacy throughout citi citis cro and cfo cochair citigroups alco which includes citis treasurer and other senior executives the alco sets the strategy of the liquidity portfolio and monitors portfolio performance see risk governanceboard and executive management committees above significant changes to portfolio asset allocations are approved by the alco citi also has other alcos which are established at various organizational levels to ensure appropriate oversight for individual entities countries franchise businesses and regions serving as the primary governance committees for managing citis balance sheet and liquidity as a supplement to alco citis funding and liquidity risk committee flrc is focused on funding and liquidity risk matters the flrc reviews and discusses the funding and liquidity risk profile of as well as risk management practices for citigroup and citibank and reports its findings and recommendations to each relevant alco as appropriate liquidity monitoring and measurement stress testing liquidity stress testing is performed for each of citis major entities operating subsidiaries and countries stress testing and scenario analyses are intended to quantify the potential impact of an adverse liquidity event on the balance sheet and liquidity position in order to have sufficient liquidity on hand to manage through such an event these scenarios include assumptions about significant changes in key funding sources market triggers such as credit ratings potential uses of funding and macroeconomic geopolitical and other conditions these conditions include expected and stressed market conditions as well as companyspecific events liquidity stress tests are performed to ascertain potential mismatches between liquidity sources and uses over a variety of time horizons and over different stressed conditions to monitor the liquidity of an entity these stress tests and potential mismatches are calculated on a daily basis given the range of potential stresses citi maintains contingency funding plans on a consolidated basis and for individual entities these plans specify a wide range of

term financings that generally include i secured funding transactions consisting of securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase ie repos and ii to a lesser extent shortterm borrowings consisting of commercial paper and borrowings from the fhlb and other market participants secured funding transactions secured funding is primarily accessed through citis broker dealer subsidiaries with a smaller portion executed through citis bank entities to efficiently fund both i secured lending activity and ii a portion of the securities inventory held in the context of market making and customer activities secured funding transactions are predominantly collateralized by government debt securities generally changes in the level of citis secured funding are primarily due to fluctuations in secured lending activity in the matched book as described below and changes in securities inventory in order to maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market conditions citi manages risks related to its secured funding by establishing secured funding limits and conducting daily stress tests that account for risks related to capacity tenor haircut collateral type counterparty and client actions secured funding of billion as of december increased yearoveryear and sequentially largely driven by additional financing to support increases in trading related assets within citis brokerdealer subsidiaries as of the quarter ended december on an average basis secured funding was billion the portion of secured funding in the brokerdealer subsidiaries that funds secured lending is commonly referred to as matched book activity and is primarily secured by highquality liquid securities such as us treasury securities us agency securities and foreign government debt securities other matched book activity is secured by less liquid securities including equity securities corporate bonds and assetbacked securities the tenor of which is generally equal to or longer than the tenor of the corresponding assets as indicated above the remaining portion of secured funding is used to fund securities inventory held in the context of market making and customer activities shortterm borrowings citis shortterm borrowings of billion as of the fourth quarter of decreased yearoveryear reflecting lower commercial paper issuances at the brokerdealer subsidiaries as citi continues to diversify its funding profile and decreased sequentially driven by normal business activity see note for further information on citigroups and its affiliates outstanding shortterm borrowings credit ratings citigroups funding and liquidity funding capacity ability to access capital markets and other sources of funds the cost of these funds and its ability to maintain certain

moodys investors service moodys sp global ratings sp potential impacts of ratings downgrades ratings downgrades by fitch moodys or sp could negatively impact citigroups andor citibanks funding and liquidity due to reduced funding capacity including derivative triggers which could take the form of cash obligations and collateral requirements the following information is provided for the purpose of analyzing the potential funding and liquidity impact to citigroup and citibank of a hypothetical simultaneous ratings downgrade across all three major rating agencies this analysis is subject to certain estimates estimation methodologies judgments and uncertainties uncertainties include potential ratings limitations that certain entities may have with respect to permissible counterparties as well as general subjective counterparty behavior for example certain corporate customers and markets counterparties could re evaluate their business relationships with citi and limit transactions in certain contracts or market instruments with citi changes in counterparty behavior could impact citis funding and liquidity as well as the results of operations of certain of its businesses the actual impact to citigroup or citibank is unpredictable and may differ materially from the potential funding and liquidity impacts described below for additional information on the impact of credit rating changes on citi and its applicable subsidiaries see risk factors liquidity risks above citigroup inc and citibankpotential derivative triggers as of december citi estimates that a hypothetical onenotch downgrade of the senior debtlongterm rating of citigroup inc across all three major rating agencies could impact citigroups funding and liquidity due to derivative triggers by approximately

approximately billion compared to billion as of september other funding sources such as secured financing transactions and other margin requirements for which there are no explicit triggers could also be adversely affected in total as of december citi estimates that a onenotch downgrade of citigroup inc and citibank across all three major rating agencies could result in increased aggregate cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately billion compared to billion as of september see also note as detailed under highquality liquid assets hqla above citigroup has various liquidity resources available to its bank and nonbank entities in part as a contingency for the potential events described above in addition a broad range of mitigating actions are currently included in citigroups and citibanks contingency funding plans for citigroup these mitigating factors include but are not limited to accessing surplus funding capacity from existing clients tailoring levels of secured lending and adjusting the size of select trading books and collateralized borrowings at certain citibank subsidiaries mitigating actions available to citibank include but are not limited to selling or financing highly liquid government securities tailoring levels of secured lending adjusting the size of select trading assets reducing loan originations and renewals raising additional deposits or borrowing from the fhlb or central banks citi believes these mitigating actions could substantially reduce the funding and liquidity risk if any of the potential downgrades described above citibankadditional potential impacts in addition to the above derivative triggers citi believes that a potential downgrade of citibanks senior debtlongterm rating across any of the three major rating agencies could also have an adverse impact on the commercial papershortterm rating of citibank citibank has provided liquidity commitments to consolidated assetbacked commercial paper conduits primarily in the form of asset purchase agreements as of december citibank had liquidity commitments of approximately billion to consolidated assetbacked commercial paper conduits unchanged from december see note in addition to the abovereferenced liquidity resources of certain citibank entities citibank could reduce the funding and liquidity risk if any of the potential downgrades described above through mitigating actions including repricing or reducing certain commitments to commercial paper conduits in the event of the potential downgrades described above citi believes that certain corporate customers could reevaluate their deposit relationships with citibank this reevaluation could result in clients adjusting their discretionary deposit levels or changing their depository institution which could potentially reduce certain deposit levels at citibank however citi could choose to adjust pricing offer alternative deposit products to its existing customers or seek to attract deposits from new customers in addition to the mitigating actions referenced above market risk overview market risk is the potential for losses arising from changes in the value of citis assets and liabilities resulting from changes in market variables such as interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices commodity prices and credit spreads as well as their implied volatilities market risk arises from both citis trading and nontrading portfolios for additional information on market risk and market risk management at citi see risk factors above each business is required to establish with approval from citis market risk management a market risk limit framework for identified risk factors that clearly defines approved risk profiles and is within the parameters of citis overall risk appetite these limits are monitored by the risk organization including various regional legal entity and business risk management committees citis country and business asset liability committees and the citigroup risk management and asset liability committees in all cases the businesses are ultimately responsible for the market risks taken and for remaining within their defined limits market risk of nontrading portfolios market risk from nontrading portfolios stems predominantly from the potential impact of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on citis net interest income and on citis accumulated other comprehensive income loss aoci from its investment securities portfolios market risk from nontrading portfolios also includes the potential impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on citis capital invested in foreign currencies banking book interest rate risk for interest rate risk purposes citis nontrading portfolios are referred to as the banking book management of interest rate risk in the banking book is governed by citis nontrading market risk policy managements asset liability committee alco establishes citis risk appetite and related limits for interest rate risk in the banking book which are subject to approval by citigroups board of directors corporate treasury is responsible for the daytoday management of citis banking book interest rate risk as well as periodically reviewing it with the alco citis banking book interest rate risk management is also subject to independent oversight from the second line of defense team reporting to the chief risk officer changes in interest rates impact citis net income aoci and cet1 these changes primarily affect citis banking book through net interest income due to a variety of risk factors including differences in timing and amounts of the maturity or repricing of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments changes in the level andor shape of interest rate curves client behavior in response to changes in interest rates eg mortgage prepayments deposit betas and changes in the maturity of instruments resulting from changes in the interest rate environment as part of their ongoing activities citis businesses generate interest ratesensitive positions from their clientfacing products such as loans and deposits the component of this interest rate risk that can be hedged is transferred via citis funds transfer pricing process to corporate treasury corporate treasury uses various tools to manage the total interest rate risk position within the established risk appetite and target citis desired risk profile including its investment securities portfolio companyissued debt and interest rate derivatives in addition citi uses multiple metrics to measure its banking book interest rate risk interest rate exposure ire is a key metric that analyzes the impact of a range of scenarios on citis banking book net interest income and certain other interest ratesensitive income versus a base case ire does not represent a forecast of citis net interest income the scenarios methodologies and assumptions used in this analysis are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the market environment changes in citis balance sheet composition enhancements in citis modeling and other factors since the third quarter of citi has employed enhanced ire methodologies and changes to certain assumptions the changes included among other things assumptions around the projected balance sheet and revisions to the treatment of certain business contributions notably accrual positions in the markets businesses these changes resulted in a higher impact to citis net interest income over a 12month period under the enhanced methodology citi utilizes the most recent quarterend balance sheet assuming no changes to its composition and size over the forecasted horizon holding the balance sheet static the forecasts incorporate expectations and assumptions of deposit pricing loan spreads and mortgage prepayment behavior implied by the interest rate curves in each scenario the base case scenario reflects the market implied forward interest rates and sensitivity scenarios assume instantaneous shocks to the base case the forecasts do not assume citi takes any riskmitigating actions in response to changes in the interest rate environment certain interest rates are subject to flooring assumptions in downward rate scenarios deposit pricing sensitivities ie deposit betas are informed by historical and expected behavior actual deposit pricing could differ from the assumptions used in these forecasts citis ire analysis primarily reflects the impacts from the following banking book assets and liabilities loans client deposits citis deposits with other banks investment securities longterm debt any related interest rate hedges and the funds transfer pricing of positions in total trading and credit portfolio value at risk var it excludes impacts from any positions that are included in total trading and credit portfolio var in addition to ire citi analyzes economic value sensitivity evs as a longerterm interest rate risk metric evs is a net present value npvbased measure of the lifetime cash flows of citis banking book it estimates the interest rate sensitivity of the banking books economic value from longerterm assets being potentially funded with shorter term liabilities or vice versa citi manages evs within risk limits approved by citigroups board of directors that are aligned with citis risk appetite interest rate risk of investment portfoliosimpact on aoci citi also measures the potential impacts of changes in interest rates on the value of its aoci which can in turn impact citis common equity and tangible common equity this will impact citis cet1 and other regulatory capital ratios citi seeks to manage its exposure to changes in the market level of interest rates while limiting the potential impact on its aoci and regulatory capital position aoci at risk is managed as part of the companywide interest rate risk position aoci at risk considers potential changes in aoci and the corresponding impact on the cet1 capital ratio relative to citis capital generation capacity citi uses basis point bps shocks in each scenario to reflect its net interest income sensitivity to unanticipated changes in market interest rates as potential monetary policy decisions and changes in economic conditions may be reflected in current marketimplied forward rates the following table presents the 12month estimated impact to citis net interest income aoci and the cet1 capital ratio each assuming an unanticipated parallel instantaneous bps increase in interest rates in millions of

approximately billion from the japanese yen and approximately billion each from the indian rupee singapore dollar korean won swiss franc and chinese yuan these impacts per currency are generally in the same direction estimated positive impact in the bps shock scenario and not offsetting citis balance sheet is asset sensitive assets reprice faster than liabilities resulting in higher net interest income in increasing interest rate scenarios the estimated impact to citis net interest income in a bps upward rate shock scenario as of december decreased quarterover quarter and yearoveryear primarily reflecting the net impact of lower expected gains due to us dollar interest rate moves that have already been realized and changes in citis balance sheet at progressively higher interest rate levels the marginal net interest income benefit is lower as citi assumes it will pass on a larger share of rate changes to depositors ie higher betas further reducing citis ire sensitivity currency specific interest rate changes and balance sheet factors may drive quartertoquarter volatility in citis estimated ire in a bps upward rate shock scenario citi expects that the approximate billion initial negative impact to aoci could potentially be offset in shareholders equity through the expected recovery of the impact on aoci through accretion of citis investment portfolio and expected net interest income benefit over a period of approximately four months scenario analysis the following table presents the estimated impact to citis net interest income aoci and cet1 capital ratio on a fully implemented basis under six different scenarios of changes in interest rates for the us dollar and all other currencies in which citi has invested capital as of december the bps downward rate scenarios are impacted by the low level of interest rates in several countries and the assumption that market interest rates as well as rates paid to depositors and charged to borrowers do not fall below zero ie the flooring assumption the interest rate scenarios are also impacted by convexity related to mortgage products and deposit pricing in millions of dollars except as otherwise noted scenario scenario scenario scenario scenario scenario overnight rate change bps 10year rate change bps interest rate exposure us dollar all other currencies1 total estimated initial impact to aoci aftertax2 estimated initial impact to cet1 capital ratio bps from aoci scenario note each scenario assumes that the rate change will occur instantaneously changes in interest rates for maturities between the overnight rate and the 10year rate are interpolated the interest rate exposure in the table above assumes no change in deposit size or mix from the baseline forecast included in the different interest scenarios presented as a result in higher interest rate scenarios customer activity resulting in a shift from noninterestbearing and low interest rate deposit products to higher yielding deposits would reduce the expected benefit to net interest income conversely in lower interest rate scenarios customer activity resulting in a shift from higheryielding deposits to noninterestbearing and low interest rate deposit products would reduce the expected decrease to net interest income scenario includes the impact from the following top six nonus dollar currencies which represents approximately of the total nonus dollar currency impact approximately billion from the japanese yen and approximately billion each from the indian rupee singapore dollar korean won swiss franc and chinese yuan these impacts per currency are generally in the same direction estimated positive impact in the bps shock scenario and not offsetting includes the effect of changes in interest rates on aoci related to investment securities cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments as presented in the table above the estimated impact to citis net interest income is larger under scenario than scenario as citis banking book has relatively higher interest rate exposure to the short end of the yield curve for us dollars exposure to downward rate shocks is larger in magnitude than to upward rate shocks this is because of the lower benefit to net interest income from citis deposit base at higher rate levels as well as the prepayment effects on mortgage loans and mortgagebacked securities for other nonus dollar currencies exposure to downward rate shocks is smaller in magnitude as a result of citis flooring assumption given low rate levels for certain nonus dollar currencies the magnitude of the impact to aoci is greater under scenario compared to scenario this is because the combination of changes to citis investment portfolio partially offset by changes related to citis pension liabilities results in a net position that is more sensitive to rates at shorter and intermediateterm maturities changes in foreign exchange ratesimpacts on aoci and capital as of december citi estimates that an unanticipated parallel instantaneous appreciation of the us dollar against all of the other currencies in which citi has invested capital could reduce citis tangible common equity tce by approximately billion or as a result of changes to citis cta in aoci net of hedges this impact would be primarily due to changes in the value of the mexican peso euro singapore dollar and indian rupee this impact is also before any mitigating actions citi may take including ongoing management of its foreign currency translation exposure specifically as currency movements change the value of citis net investments in foreign currency denominated capital these movements also change the value of citis riskweighted assets denominated in those currencies in millions of dollars except as otherwise noted change in fx spot rate1 change in tce due to fx translation net of hedges as a percentage of tce estimated impact to cet1 capital ratio on a fully implemented basis due to changes in fx translation net of hedges bps this coupled with citis foreign currency hedging strategies such as foreign currency borrowings foreign currency forwards and other currency hedging instruments lessens the impact of foreign currency movements on citis cet1 capital ratio changes in these hedging strategies as well as hedging costs divestitures and tax impacts can further affect the actual impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on citis capital compared to an unanticipated parallel shock as described above the effect of citis ongoing management strategies with respect to quarterly changes in foreign exchange rates and the quarterly impact of these changes on citis tce and cet1 capital ratio are presented in the table below see note for additional

sensitivities are calculated monitored and limited for all material risks taken in the trading portfolios value at risk var var estimates at a confidence level the potential decline in the value of a position or a portfolio under normal market conditions assuming a oneday holding period var statistics which are based on historical data can be materially different across firms due to differences in portfolio composition var methodologies and model parameters as a result citi believes var statistics can be used more effectively as indicators of trends in risktaking within a firm rather than as a basis for inferring differences in risktaking across firms citi uses a single independently approved monte carlo simulation var model see var model review and validation below which has been designed to capture material risk sensitivities such as first and secondorder sensitivities of positions to changes in market prices of various asset classesrisk types such as interest rate credit spread foreign exchange equity and commodity risks citis var includes positions that are measured at fair value it does not include investment securities classified as afs or htm see note for information on

commodities and three years for others market volatility the monte carlo simulation involves approximately market factors making use of approximately time series with sensitivities updated daily volatility parameters updated intramonthly and correlation parameters updated monthly the conservative features of the var calibration contribute an approximate addon to what would be a var estimated

model review and validation generally citis var review and model validation process entails reviewing the model framework major assumptions and implementation of the mathematical algorithm in addition productspecific backtesting on portfolios is periodically completed as part of the ongoing model performance monitoring process and reviewed with citis us banking regulators furthermore regulatory var back testing as described below is performed against buyand hold profit and loss on a monthly basis for multiple sub portfolios across the organization trading desk level and total citigroup and the results are shared with us banking regulators material var model and assumption changes must be independently validated within citis independent risk management organization all model changes including those for the var model are validated by the model validation group within citis model risk management in the event of significant model changes parallel model runs are undertaken prior to implementation in addition significant model and assumption changes are subject to the periodic reviews and approval by citis us banking regulators citi uses the same independently validated var model for both regulatory var and risk management var ie total trading and total trading and credit portfolios vars and as such the model review and validation process for both purposes is as described above regulatory var which is calculated in accordance with basel iii differs from risk management var because certain positions included in risk management var are not eligible for market risk treatment in regulatory var the composition of risk management var is discussed under value at risk above the applicability of the var model for positions eligible for market risk treatment under us regulatory capital rules is periodically reviewed and approved by citis us banking regulators in accordance with basel iii regulatory var includes all trading bookcovered positions and all foreign exchange and commodity exposures pursuant to basel iii regulatory var excludes positions that fail to meet the intent and ability to trade requirements and are therefore classified as non trading book and categories of exposures that are specifically excluded as covered positions regulatory var excludes cva on derivative instruments and dva on citis own fair value option liabilities cva hedges are excluded from regulatory var and included in credit riskweighted assets as computed under the advanced approaches for determining riskweighted assets regulatory var backtesting in accordance with basel iii citi is required to perform back testing to evaluate the effectiveness of its regulatory var model regulatory var backtesting is the process in which the daily oneday var at a confidence interval is compared to the buyandhold profit and loss ie the profit and loss impact if the portfolio is held constant at the end of the day and repriced the following day buyandhold profit and loss represents the daily marktomarket profit and loss attributable to price movements in covered positions from the close of the previous business day buyandhold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue net interest fees and commissions intraday trading profit and loss and changes in reserves based on a confidence level citi would expect two to three days in any one year where buyandhold losses exceed the regulatory var given the conservative calibration of citis var model as a result of taking the greater of short and longterm volatilities and fattail scaling of volatilities citi would expect fewer exceptions under normal and stable market conditions periods of unstable market conditions could increase the number of backtesting exceptions the following graph presents the daily buyandhold profit and loss associated with citis covered positions compared to citis oneday regulatory var during during three backtesting exceptions were observed at the citigroup level the difference between the of days with buyand hold gains for regulatory var backtesting and the of days with trading net interest and other revenue associated with citis trading businesses presented in the histogram of daily tradingrelated revenue below reflects among other things that a significant portion of citis tradingrelated revenue is not generated from daily price movements on these

december in millions of dollars buyandhold profit and loss as defined by the banking regulators under basel iii represents the daily marktomarket revenue movement attributable to the trading position from the close of the previous business day buyandhold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue and net interest intraday trading profit and loss on new and terminated trades as well as changes in reserves therefore it is not comparable to the tradingrelated revenue presented in the chart of daily tradingrelated revenue above the loss values for midaugust and middecember were driven by the devaluation of the argentine peso stress testing citi performs market risk stress testing on a regular basis to estimate the impact of extreme market movements it is performed on individual positions and trading portfolios as well as in aggregate inclusive of multiple trading portfolios citis market risk management after consultations with the businesses develops both systemic and specific stress scenarios reviews the output of periodic stress testing exercises and uses the information to assess the ongoing appropriateness of exposure levels and limits citi uses two complementary approaches to market risk stress testing across all major risk factors ie equity foreign exchange commodity interest rate and credit spreads topdown systemic stresses and bottomup businessspecific stresses systemic stresses are designed to quantify the potential impact of extreme market movements on an institutionwide basis and are constructed using both historical periods of market stress and projections of adverse economic scenarios businessspecific stresses are designed to probe the risks of particular portfolios and market segments especially those risks that are not fully captured in var and systemic stresses the systemic stress scenarios and businessspecific stress scenarios at citi are used in several reports reviewed by senior management and also to calculate internal risk capital for trading market risk as well as enable the monitoring and managing of citis top market risks in general changes in market values are defined over a oneyear horizon for the most liquid positions and market factors changes in market values are defined over a shorter twomonth horizon the limited set of positions and market factors whose market value changes are defined over a two month horizon are those that in managements judgment have historically remained very liquid during financial crises even as the trading liquidity of most other positions and market factors materially declined operational risk overview operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems including human error or misjudgment or from external events this includes legal risk which is the risk of loss including litigation costs settlements and regulatory fines resulting from the failure of citi to comply with laws regulations

upon either the substantial liquidation or a loss of control of ao citibank citi has separately described these risks in deconsolidation risk below during the fourth quarter of citis russiarelated exposures increased by billion as presented in the table above the increase in exposure was driven by a billion appreciation of the ruble against the us dollar usd as well as dividend inflows during the quarter received from russian corporations on behalf of citis clients the dividend inflows were partially offset by deposit outflows and tax payments to local authorities approximately of citis remaining exposures in russia are corporate dividends that citi cannot remit to its clients due to restrictions imposed by the russian government of which billion is held with the deposit insurance agency as of december citis net investment in russia was approximately billion as of december down from billion as of september the decline was due to a reserve build related to increases in transfer

impact from any portfolio sales this estimate was revised down during the fourth quarter of from million at september for additional information about citis continued efforts to reduce its operations and exposure in russia see risk factors above and note deconsolidation risk citis remaining operations in russia subject it to various risks including among others foreign currency volatility including appreciation or devaluation restrictions arising from retaliatory russian laws and regulations on the conduct of its business sanctions or asset freezes or other deconsolidation events see risk factorsother risks above examples of triggers that may result in deconsolidation of ao citibank include voluntary or forced sale of ownership or loss of control due to actions of relevant governmental authorities including expropriation ie the entity becomes subject to the complete control of a government court administrator trustee or regulator revocation of banking license and loss of ability to elect a board of directors or appoint members of senior management as of december citi continued to consolidate ao citibank because none of the deconsolidation factors were triggered in the event citi deems there is a loss of control for example through expropriation of ao citibank citis foreign entity in russia citi would be required to i write off the net investment of approximately billion compared to billion as of september ii recognize a cta loss of approximately billion unchanged from september through earnings and iii recognize a loss of billion unchanged from september on intercompany liabilities owed by ao citibank to other citi entities outside russia in the sole event of a substantial liquidation as opposed to a loss of control citi would be required to recognize the cta loss of approximately billion through earnings and would evaluate its remaining net investment as circumstances evolve citi as paying agent for russiarelated clients citi serves or served as paying agent on bonds issued by various entities in russia including russian corporate clients citis role as paying agent is administrative in this role citi acts as an agent of its client the bond issuer receiving interest and principal payments from the bond issuer and then making payments to international central securities depositories eg depository trust company euroclear clearstream the international central securities depositories icsds make payments to those participants or account holders eg broker dealers that have clients who are investors in the applicable bonds ie bondholders as a paying agent citi generally does not have information about the identity of the bondholders citi may be exposed to risks due to its responsibilities for receiving and processing payments on behalf of its clients as a result of sanctions or other governmental requirements and prohibitions to mitigate operational and sanctions risks citi has established policies procedures and controls for client relationships and payment processing to help ensure compliance with us uk eu and other jurisdictions sanctions laws these processes may require citi to delay or withhold the processing of payments as a result of sanctions on the bond issuer citi is also prevented from making payments to accounts on behalf of bondholders should the icsds disclose to citi the presence of sanctioned bondholders in both instances citi is generally required to segregate restrict or block the funds until applicable sanctions are lifted or the payment is otherwise authorized under applicable law reputational risks citi has continued its efforts to enhance and protect its reputation with its colleagues clients customers investors regulators and the public citis response to the war in ukraine including any action or inaction may have a negative impact on citis reputation with some or all of these parties for example citi is exposed to reputational risk as a result of its remaining presence in russia and association with russian individuals or entities whether subject to sanctions or not including citis inability to support its global clients in russia which could adversely affect its broader client relationships and businesses current involvement in transactions or supporting activities involving russian assets or interests failure to correctly interpret and apply laws and regulations including those related to sanctions perceived misalignment of citis actions to its stated strategy in russia and the reputational impact from citis activity and engagement with ukraine or with nonrussian clients exiting their russia businesses while citi announced its intention to wind down its businesses in russia citi will continue to manage those operations during the winddown process and will be required to maintain certain limited operations to fulfill its remaining legal and regulatory obligations also sanctions and sanctions compliance are highly complex and may change over time and result in increased operational risk failure to fully comply with relevant sanctions or the application of sanctions where they should not be applied may negatively impact citis reputation in addition citi currently performs services for conducts business with or deals in nonsanctioned russian owned businesses and russian assets this has attracted and will likely continue to attract negative attention despite the previously disclosed plan to wind down nearly all its activities in the country cessation of new business and client originations and reduction of other exposures citis continued presence or divestiture of businesses in russia could also increase its susceptibility to cyberattacks that could negatively impact its relationships with clients and customers harm its reputation increase its compliance costs and adversely affect its business operations and results of operations for additional information on operational and cyber risks see risk

respect to cybersecurity matters ukraine citi has continued to operate in ukraine throughout the war through its services markets and banking businesses serving the local subsidiaries of multinationals along with local financial institutions and the public sector citi employs approximately people in ukraine and their safety is citis top priority all of citis domestic operations in ukraine are conducted through a subsidiary of citibank which uses the ukrainian hryvnia as its functional currency as of december citi had billion of direct exposures related to ukraine unchanged from september argentina citi operates in argentina through its services markets and banking businesses as of december citis net investment in its argentine operations was approximately billion compared to billion at september citi uses the us dollar usd as the functional currency for its operations in countries such as argentina that are deemed highly inflationary in accordance with gaap citi therefore records the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on its net argentine peso arsdenominated assets directly in earnings citi uses argentinas official market exchange rate to remeasure its net arsdenominated assets into usd as of december the official ars exchange rate was which devalued by against the usd during the fourth quarter of the decline in citis net investment in argentina during the fourth quarter of was primarily a result of approximately million in translation losses in revenues due to devaluation of the ars approximately billion in aggregate translation losses in revenues for fullyear compared to approximately million for fullyear the decline in the net investment was also due to reserve builds in the quarter related to increases in transfer risk associated with exposures in argentina driven by safety and soundness considerations under us banking law these reductions in the net investment were partially offset by aggregate other net income consisting of net interest income in argentina and interest earned on the net investment of which a significant portion is invested at high local overnight rates in argentina the central bank of argentina has continued to maintain certain capital and currency controls that generally restrict citis ability to access usd in argentina and remit earnings from its argentine operations citis net investment in argentina will therefore continue to be exposed to additional foreign currency translation losses to the extent it is denominated in ars and is unable to be remitted or exchanged furthermore the capital and currency controls have resulted in indirect foreign exchange mechanisms that ffieccrossborder claims on third parties and local country assets citis crossborder disclosures are presented below based on the country exposure bank regulatory reporting guidelines of the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec the following summarizes some of the key ffiec reporting guidelines amounts are based on the domicile of the ultimate obligor counterparty collateral only including qualifying liquid collateral issuer or guarantor as applicable eg a security recorded by a citi us entity but issued by the uk government is considered uk exposure a loan recorded by a citi mexico entity to a customer domiciled in mexico where the underlying collateral is held in germany is considered german exposure amounts do not consider the benefit of collateral received for secured financing transactions ie repurchase agreements reverse repurchase agreements and securities loaned and borrowed and are reported based on notional amounts netting of derivative receivables and payables reported at fair value is permitted but only under a legally binding netting agreement with the same specific counterparty and does not include the benefit of margin received or hedges credit default swaps cds are included based on the gross notional amount sold and purchased and do not include any offsetting cds on the same underlying entity loans are reported without the benefit of hedges given the requirements noted above citis ffiec cross border exposures and total outstandings tend to fluctuate in some cases significantly from period to period as an example because total outstandings under ffiec guidelines do not include the benefit of margin or hedges market volatility in interest rates foreign exchange rates and credit spreads may cause significant fluctuations in the level of total outstandings all else being equal some argentine entities may use to obtain usd generally at rates that are significantly higher than argentinas official exchange rate citibank argentina is precluded from accessing these alternative mechanisms and under us gaap these exchange mechanisms cannot be used to remeasure citis net monetary assets into usd if argentinas official exchange rate further converges with the approximate rate implied by the indirect foreign exchange mechanisms citi could incur additional translation losses on its net investment in argentina accordingly citi seeks to reduce its overall ars exposure in argentina while complying with local capital and currency exposure limitations of the billion net investment in argentina as of december citis net ars exposure was approximately billion the net ars exposure is reduced as a result of citi holding approximately million of usd denominated loans as well as approximately million of certain local government bonds that are indexed to the higher of the usd exchange rate or the local inflation index if citi had not invested in such instruments to reduce its ars exposure citi would have recognized additional translation losses during the fourth quarter of given current economic conditions and the local capital currency and regulatory limitations citi cannot guarantee the availability or effectiveness of such mechanisms to reduce its ars exposure in the future in addition to reducing the ars exposure citi also seeks to economically hedge the exposure to the extent possible and prudent using nondeliverable forward ndf derivative instruments that are primarily executed outside of argentina as of december the international ndf market had very limited liquidity resulting in citis inability to economically hedge its remaining net ars exposure accordingly and to the extent that citi does not execute ndf contracts for this unhedged exposure in the future citi would record devaluations on its net arsdenominated assets in earnings without any benefit from a change in the fair value of derivative positions used to economically hedge the exposure citi cannot predict the availability of hedging instruments in the future nor can it predict changes in foreign exchange rates and the resulting impact on earnings citi continually evaluates its economic exposure to its argentine counterparties and reserves for changes in credit risk and records marktomarket adjustments for relevant market risks associated with its argentine assets citi believes it has established an appropriate acl on its argentine loans and appropriate fair value adjustments on argentine assets and liabilities measured at fair value for credit and sovereign risks under us gaap as of december for additional information on citis emerging markets risks including those related to its argentine exposures see
