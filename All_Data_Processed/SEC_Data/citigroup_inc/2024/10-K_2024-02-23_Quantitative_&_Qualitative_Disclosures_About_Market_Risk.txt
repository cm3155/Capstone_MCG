purchased creditdeteriorated htm debt securities held by the company as of december and evaluating investments for impairmentafs debt securities overview the company conducts periodic reviews of all afs debt securities with unrealized losses to evaluate whether the impairment resulted from expected credit losses or from other factors and to evaluate the companys intent to sell such securities an afs debt security is impaired when the current fair value of an individual afs debt security is less than its amortized cost basis the company recognizes the entire difference between amortized cost basis and fair value in earnings for impaired afs debt securities that citi has an intent to sell or for which citi believes it will morelikelythannot be required to sell prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis however for those afs debt securities that the company does not intend to sell and is not likely to be required to sell only the credit related impairment is recognized in earnings by recording an allowance for credit losses any remaining fair value decline for such securities is recorded in aoci the company does not consider the length of time that the fair value of a security is below its amortized cost when determining if a credit loss exists for afs debt securities credit losses exist where citi does not expect to receive contractual principal and interest cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of a security the allowance for credit losses is limited to the amount by which the afs debt securitys amortized cost basis exceeds its fair value the allowance is increased or decreased if credit conditions subsequently worsen or improve reversals of credit losses are recognized in earnings the companys review for impairment of afs debt securities generally entails identification and evaluation of impaired investments consideration of evidential matter including an evaluation of factors or triggers that could cause individual positions to qualify as credit impaired and those that would not support credit impairment and documentation of the results of these analyses as required under business policies the sections below describe the companys process for identifying expected credit impairments for debt security types that have the most significant unrealized losses as of december agency mortgagebacked securities citi records no allowances for credit losses on us governmentagencyguaranteed mortgagebacked securities because the company expects to incur no credit losses in the event of default due to a history of incurring no credit losses and due to the nature of the counterparties state and municipal securities the process for estimating credit losses in citigroups afs state and municipal bonds is primarily based on a credit analysis that incorporates thirdparty credit ratings citi monitors the bond issuers and any insurers providing default protection in the form of financial guarantee insurance the average external credit rating disregarding any insurance is aa2aa in the event of an external rating downgrade or other indicator of credit impairment ie based on instrument specific estimates of cash flows or probability of issuer default the subject bond is specifically reviewed for adverse changes in the amount or timing of expected contractual principal and interest payments for afs state and municipal bonds with unrealized losses that citi plans to sell or would morelikelythannot be required to sell prior to recovery of value the full impairment is recognized in earnings for afs state and municipal bonds where citi has no intent to sell and it is not morelikelythan not that the company will be required to sell citi records an allowance for expected credit losses for the amount it expects not to collect capped at the difference between the bonds amortized cost basis and fair value equity method investments management assesses equity method investments that have fair values that are less than their respective carrying values for otherthantemporary impairment otti fair value is measured as price multiplied by quantity if the investee has publicly listed securities if the investee is not publicly listed other methods are used see note for impaired equity method investments that citi plans to sell prior to recovery of value or would morelikelythannot be required to sell with no expectation that the fair value will recover prior to the expected sale date the full impairment is recognized as otti in other revenue regardless of severity and duration the measurement of the otti does not include partial projected recoveries subsequent to the balance sheet date for impaired equity method investments that management does not plan to sell and is not morelikelythannot to be required to sell prior to recovery of value the evaluation of whether an impairment is otherthantemporary is based on i whether and when an equity method investment will recover in value and ii whether the investor has the intent and ability to hold that investment for a period of time sufficient to recover the value the determination of whether the impairment is considered otherthantemporary considers the following indicators the cause of the impairment and the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer including any specific events that may influence the operations of the issuer the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value and the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the carrying value recognition and measurement of impairment the following table presents total impairment on afs investments recognized in earnings in millions of

investment of the same issuer the carrying value of the equity security is adjusted to fair value on the date of an observed transaction fair value may differ from the observed transaction price due

open ended consumer loans such as credit cards are governed by federal financial institutions examination council ffiec guidelines for openended consumer loans subject to ffiec guidelines one of the conditions for a loan to be reaged to current status is that at least three consecutive minimum monthly payments or the equivalent amount must be received in addition under ffiec guidelines the number

to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty citi seeks to modify consumer loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty to minimize losses avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral and

time of modification citis significant consumer modification programs are described below credit cards citi seeks to assist credit card borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty by offering longterm loan modification programs these modifications generally involve reducing the interest rate on the credit card placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not to exceed months and canceling the customers available line of credit citi also grants modifications to credit card borrowers working with third party renegotiation agencies that seek to restructure customers entire unsecured debt in both circumstances if the cardholder does not comply with the modified payment terms the credit card loan continues to age and will ultimately be charged off in accordance with citis standard chargeoff policy in certain situations citi may forgive a portion of an outstanding balance if the borrower pays a required amount residential mortgages citi utilizes a thirdparty subservicer for the

interest entities uses of special purpose entities a special purpose entity spe is an entity designed to fulfill a specific limited need of the company that organized it the principal uses of spes by citi are to assist clients in securitizing their financial assets and create investment products for clients and to obtain liquidity and optimize capital efficiency by securitizing certain of citis financial assets spes may be organized in various legal forms including trusts partnerships or corporations in a securitization through the spes issuance of debt and equity instruments certificates commercial paper or other notes of indebtedness the company transferring assets to the spe converts all or a portion of those assets into cash before they would have been realized in the normal course of business these issuances are recorded on the balance sheet of the spe which may or may not be consolidated onto the balance sheet of the company that organized the spe investors usually have recourse only to the assets in the spe but may also benefit from other credit enhancements such as a collateral account a line of credit or a liquidity facility such as a liquidity put option or asset purchase agreement because of these enhancements the spe issuances typically obtain a more favorable credit rating than the transferor could obtain for its own debt issuances this results in less expensive financing costs than unsecured debt the spe may also enter into derivative contracts in order to convert the yield or currency of the underlying assets to match the needs of the spe investors or to limit or change the credit risk of the spe citigroup may be the provider of certain credit enhancements as well as the counterparty to any related derivative contracts most of citigroups spes are variable interest entities vies variable interest entities vies are described in note investors that finance the vie through debt or equity interests or other counterparties providing other forms of support such as guarantees certain fee arrangements or certain types of derivative contracts are variable interest holders in the entity the variable interest holder if any that has a controlling financial interest in a vie is deemed to be the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie the company must evaluate each vie to understand the purpose and design of the entity the role the company had in the entitys design and its involvement in the vies ongoing activities the company then must evaluate which activities most significantly impact the economic performance of the vie and who has the power to direct such activities for those vies where the company determines that it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vies economic performance the company must then evaluate its economic interests if any and determine whether it could absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie when evaluating whether the company has an obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant it considers the maximum exposure to such loss without consideration of probability such obligations could be in various forms including but not limited to debt and equity investments guarantees liquidity agreements and certain derivative contracts in various other transactions the company may i act as a derivative counterparty eg interest rate swap cross currency swap or purchaser of credit protection under a credit default swap or total return swap where the company pays the total return on certain assets to the spe ii act as underwriter or placement agent iii provide administrative trustee or other services or iv make a market in debt securities or other instruments

issuance of trust certificates backed solely by the transferred assets these certificates have the same life as the transferred assets in addition to providing a source of liquidity and less expensive funding securitizing these assets also reduces citis credit exposure to the borrowers these mortgage loan securitizations are primarily nonrecourse thereby effectively transferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchasers of the securities issued by the trust citis us consumer mortgage business generally retains the servicing rights and in certain instances retains investment securities

therefore citi is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the entity in certain instances the company has i the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities economic

securitization of mortgage loans citis us consumer mortgage business generally retains the servicing rights which entitle the company to a future stream of cash flows based on the outstanding principal balances of the loans and the contractual servicing fee failure to service the loans in accordance with contractual requirements may lead to a termination of the servicing rights and the loss of future servicing fees these transactions create intangible assets referred to as msrs which are recorded at fair value on citis consolidated balance sheet the fair value of citis capitalized

changes in capitalized msrs in millions of dollars balance beginning of year originations changes in fair value of msrs due to changes in inputs and assumptions other changes1 balance as of december represents changes due to customer payments the fair value of the msrs is primarily affected by changes in prepayments of mortgages that result from shifts in mortgage interest rates specifically higher interest rates tend to lead to declining prepayments which causes the fair value of the msrs to increase in managing this risk citigroup economically hedges a significant portion of the value

citi holds a retained interest as of december and were approximately billion and billion respectively as of december and the company did not consolidate any private label or agency resecuritization entities citiadministered assetbacked commercial paper conduits the company is active in the assetbacked commercial paper conduit business as administrator of several multiseller commercial paper conduits and also as a service provider to singleseller and other commercial paper conduits sponsored by third parties citis multiseller commercial paper conduits are designed to provide the companys clients access to lowcost funding in the commercial paper markets the conduits purchase assets from or provide financing facilities to clients and are funded by issuing commercial paper to thirdparty investors the conduits generally do not purchase assets originated by citi the funding of the conduits is facilitated by the liquidity support and credit enhancements provided by the company as administrator to citis conduits the company is generally responsible for selecting and structuring assets purchased or financed by the conduits making decisions regarding the funding of the conduits including determining the tenor and other features of the commercial paper issued monitoring the quality and performance of the conduits assets and facilitating the operations and cash flows of the conduits in return the company earns structuring fees from customers for individual transactions and earns an administration fee from the conduit which is equal to the income from the client program and liquidity fees of the conduit after payment of conduit expenses this administration fee is fairly stable since most risks and rewards of the underlying assets are passed back to the clients once the asset pricing is negotiated most ongoing income costs and fees are relatively stable as a percentage of the conduits size the conduits administered by citi do not generally invest in liquid securities that are formally rated by third parties the assets are privately negotiated and structured transactions that are generally designed to be held by the conduit rather than actively traded and sold the yield earned by the conduit on each asset is generally tied to the rate on the commercial paper issued by the conduit thus passing interest rate risk to the client each asset purchased by the conduit is structured with transactionspecific credit enhancement features provided by the thirdparty client seller including overcollateralization cash and excess spread collateral accounts direct recourse or thirdparty guarantees these credit enhancements are sized with the objective of approximating a credit rating of a or above based on citis internal risk ratings at december and the commercial paper conduits administered by citi had approximately billion and billion of purchased assets outstanding respectively and had unfunded commitments with clients of approximately billion and billion respectively substantially all of the funding of the conduits is in the form of shortterm commercial paper at december and the weightedaverage remaining maturities of the commercial paper issued by the conduits were approximately and days respectively the primary credit enhancement provided to the conduit investors is in the form of transactionspecific credit enhancements described above each asset purchased by the conduit is structured with transactionspecific credit enhancement including overcollateralization cash and excess spread collateral accounts direct recourse or thirdparty guarantees credit enhancement is sized with the objective of approximating an investmentgrade credit rating based on citis internal risk ratings in addition to the transaction specific credit enhancement the conduits have obtained letters of credit from the company that equal at least to of the conduits assets with a minimum of million to million the letters of credit provided by the company to the conduits total approximately billion as of december and billion as of december the net result across multiseller conduits administered by the company is that in the event that defaulted assets exceed the transaction specific credit enhancement described above any losses in each conduit are allocated first to the company and then to the commercial paper investors citigroup also provides the conduits with two forms of liquidity agreements that are used to provide funding to the conduits in the event of a market disruption among other events each asset of the conduits is supported by a transactionspecific liquidity facility in the form of an asset purchase agreement apa under the apa the company has generally agreed to purchase nondefaulted eligible receivables from the conduit at par the apa is not designed to provide credit support to the conduit as it generally does not permit the purchase of defaulted or impaired assets any funding under the apa will likely subject the underlying conduit clients to increased interest costs in addition the company provides the conduits with programwide liquidity in the form of shortterm lending commitments under these commitments the company has agreed to lend to the conduits in the event of a shortterm disruption in the commercial paper market subject to specified conditions the company receives fees for providing both types of liquidity agreements and considers these fees to be on fair market terms finally citi is one of several named dealers in the commercial paper issued by the conduits and earns a market based fee for providing such services along with thirdparty dealers the company makes a market in the commercial paper and may from time to time fund commercial paper pending sale to a third party on specific dates with less liquidity in the market the company may hold in inventory commercial paper issued by conduits administered by the company as well as conduits administered by third parties separately in the normal course of business citi purchases commercial paper including commercial paper issued by citigroups conduits at december and the company owned billion and billion respectively of the commercial paper issued by its administered conduits the companys investments were not driven by market illiquidity and the company is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the conduits the assetbacked commercial paper conduits are consolidated by citi the company has determined that through its roles as administrator and liquidity provider it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities economic performance these powers include its ability to structure and approve the assets purchased by the conduits its ongoing surveillance and credit mitigation activities its ability to sell or repurchase assets out of the conduits and its liability management in addition as a result of all the companys involvement described above it was concluded that citi has an economic interest that could potentially be significant no assets of any conduit are available to satisfy the creditors of citigroup or any of its other subsidiaries collateralized loan obligations clos a collateralized loan obligation clo is a vie that purchases a portfolio of assets consisting primarily of noninvestment grade corporate loans clos issue multiple tranches of debt and equity to investors to fund the asset purchases and pay upfront expenses associated with forming the clo a third party asset manager is contracted by the clo to purchase the underlying assets from the open market and monitor the credit risk associated with those assets over the term of a clo the asset manager directs purchases and sales of assets in a manner consistent with the clos asset management agreement and indenture in general the clo asset manager will have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the economic performance of the clo investors in a clo through their ownership of debt andor equity in it can also direct certain activities of the clo including removing its asset manager under limited circumstances optionally redeeming the notes voting on amendments to the clos operating documents and other activities a clo has a finite life typically years citi serves as a structuring and placement agent with respect to the clos typically the debt and equity of the clos are sold to thirdparty investors on occasion certain citi entities may purchase some portion of a clos liabilities for investment purposes in addition citi may purchase typically in the secondary market certain securities issued by the clos to support its marketmaking activities the company generally does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the clos as this power is generally held by a thirdparty asset manager of the clo as such those clos are not consolidated the following tables summarize selected cash flow information and retained interests related to citigroup clos in billions of dollars cash flows received on retained interests and other net cash flows purchases of previously transferred financial assets in millions of dollars carrying value of retained interests dec dec dec all of citis retained interests were heldtomaturity securities as of december and municipal securities tender option bond tob trusts municipal tob trusts may hold fixed or floatingrate taxable or taxexempt securities issued by state and local governments and municipalities tob trusts are typically structured as singleissuer entities whose assets are purchased from either the company or from other investors in the municipal securities market tob trusts finance the purchase of their municipal assets by issuing two classes of certificates long dated floating rate certificates floaters that are putable pursuant to a liquidity facility and residual interest certificates residuals the floaters are purchased by thirdparty investors typically taxexempt money market funds the residuals are purchased by the original owner of the municipal securities that are being financed from citigroups perspective there are two types of tob trusts customer and noncustomer customer tob trusts are those trusts utilized by customers of the company to finance their securities generally municipal securities the residuals issued by these trusts are purchased by the customer being financed noncustomer tob trusts are generally used by the company to finance its own municipal securities investments the residuals issued by noncustomer tob trusts are purchased by the company with respect to both customer and noncustomer tob trusts citi may provide remarketing agent services if floaters are optionally tendered and the company in its role as remarketing agent is unable to find a new investor to purchase the optionally tendered floaters within a specified period of time citigroup may but is not obligated to purchase the tendered floaters into its own inventory the level of the companys inventory of such floaters fluctuates for certain customer tob trusts citi may also serve as a voluntary advance provider in this capacity the company may but is not obligated to make loan advances to customer tob trusts to purchase optionally tendered floaters that have not otherwise been successfully remarketed to new investors such loans are secured by pledged floaters as of december citi had no outstanding voluntary advances to customer tob trusts for certain noncustomer trusts the company also provides credit enhancement at december and none of the municipal bonds owned by noncustomer tob trusts were subject to a credit guarantee provided by the company citigroup also provides liquidity services to many customer and noncustomer trusts if a trust is unwound early due to an event other than a credit event on the underlying municipal bonds the underlying municipal bonds are sold out of the trust and bond sale proceeds are used to redeem the outstanding trust certificates if this results in a shortfall between the bond sale proceeds and the redemption price of the tendered floaters the company pursuant to the liquidity agreement would be obligated to make a payment to the trust to satisfy that shortfall for certain customer tob trusts citigroup has also executed a reimbursement agreement with the holder of the residual pursuant to which the residual holder is obligated to reimburse the company for any payment the company makes under the liquidity arrangement these reimbursement agreements may be subject to daily margining based on changes in the market value of the underlying municipal bonds in cases where a third party provides liquidity to a noncustomer tob trust a similar reimbursement arrangement may be executed whereby the company or a consolidated subsidiary of the company as residual holder would absorb any losses incurred by the liquidity provider for certain other noncustomer tob trusts citi serves as tender option provider the tender option provider arrangement allows floater holders to put their interests directly to the company at any time subject to the requisite notice period requirements at a price of par at december and liquidity agreements provided with respect to customer tob trusts totaled billion and billion respectively of which billion and billion respectively were offset by reimbursement agreements for the remaining exposure related to tob transactions where the residual owned by the customer was at least of the bond value at the inception of the transaction no reimbursement agreement was executed citi considers both customer and noncustomer tob trusts to be vies customer tob trusts are not consolidated by the company as the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the trusts economic performance rests with the customer residual holder which may unilaterally cause the sale of the trusts bonds noncustomer tob trusts generally are consolidated because the company holds the residual interest and thus has the unilateral power to cause the sale of the trusts bonds the company also provides other liquidity agreements or letters of credit to customersponsored municipal investment funds which are not variable interest entities and municipalityrelated issuers that totaled billion as of december and billion as of december these liquidity agreements and letters of credit are offset by reimbursement agreements with various termout provisions municipal investments municipal investment transactions include debt and equity interests in partnerships that finance the construction and rehabilitation of lowincome housing facilitate lending in new or underserved markets or finance the construction or operation of renewable municipal energy facilities citi generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits and grants earned from the investments made by the partnership the company may also provide construction loans or permanent loans for the development or operation of real estate properties held by partnerships these entities are generally considered vies the power to direct the activities of these entities is typically held by the general partner accordingly these entities are not consolidated by citigroup client intermediation client intermediation transactions represent a range of transactions designed to provide investors with specified returns based on the returns of an underlying security referenced asset or index these transactions include credit linked notes and equitylinked notes in these transactions the vie typically obtains exposure to the underlying security referenced asset or index through a derivative instrument such as a totalreturn swap or a creditdefault swap in turn the vie issues notes to investors that pay a return based on the specified underlying security referenced asset or index the vie invests the proceeds in a financial asset or a guaranteed insurance contract that serves as collateral for the derivative contract over the term of the transaction the companys involvement in these transactions includes being the counterparty to the vies derivative instruments and investing in a portion of the notes issued by the vie in certain transactions the investors maximum risk of loss is limited and the company absorbs risk of loss above a specified level citi does not have the power to direct the activities of the vies that most significantly impact their economic performance and thus it does not consolidate them citis maximum risk of loss in these transactions is defined as the amount invested in notes issued by the vie and the notional amount of any risk of loss absorbed by citi through a separate instrument issued by the vie the derivative instrument held by the company may generate a receivable from the vie eg where the company purchases credit protection from the vie in connection with the vies issuance of a creditlinked note which is collateralized by the assets owned by the vie these derivative instruments are not considered variable interests and any associated receivables are not included in the calculation of maximum exposure to the vie investment funds the company is the investment manager for certain investment funds and retirement funds that invest in various asset classes including private equity hedge funds real estate fixed income and infrastructure citigroup earns a management fee which is a percentage of capital under management and may earn performance fees in addition for some of these funds the company has an ownership interest in the investment funds citi has also established a number of investment funds as opportunities for qualified employees to invest in private equity investments the company acts as investment manager for these funds and may provide employees with financing on both recourse and nonrecourse bases for a portion of the employees investment commitments assetbased financing the company provides loans and other forms of financing to vies that hold assets those loans are subject to the same credit approvals as all other loans originated or purchased by the company financings in the form of debt securities or derivatives are in most circumstances reported in trading account assets and accounted for at fair value through earnings the company generally does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact these vies economic performance thus it does not consolidate them the primary types of citis assetbased financings total assets of the unconsolidated vies with significant involvement and citis maximum exposure to loss are presented below for citi to realize the maximum loss the vie borrower

ordinary course of business citigroup enters into various types of derivative transactions which include futures and forward contracts which are commitments to buy or sell at a future date a financial instrument commodity or currency at a contracted price that may be settled in cash or through delivery of an item readily convertible to cash swap contracts which are commitments to settle in cash at a future date or dates that may range from a few days to a number of years based on differentials between specified indices or financial instruments as applied to a notional principal amount option contracts which give the purchaser for a premium the right but not the obligation to buy or sell within a specified time a financial instrument commodity or currency at a contracted price that may also be settled in cash based on differentials between specified indices or prices swaps forwards and some option contracts are overthe counter otc derivatives that are bilaterally negotiated with counterparties and settled with those counterparties except for swap contracts that are novated and cleared through central counterparties ccps futures contracts and other option contracts are standardized contracts that are traded on an exchange with a ccp as the counterparty from the inception of the transaction citigroup enters into derivative contracts relating to interest rate foreign currency commodity and other marketcredit risks for the following reasons trading purposes citigroup trades derivatives as an active market maker citigroup offers its customers derivatives in connection with their risk management actions to transfer modify or reduce their interest rate foreign exchange and other marketcredit risks or for their own trading purposes citigroup also manages its derivative risk positions through offsetting trade activities hedging citigroup uses derivatives in connection with its own risk management activities to hedge certain risks or reposition the risk profile of the company hedging may be accomplished by applying hedge accounting in accordance with asc derivatives and hedging for example citigroup issues fixedrate longterm debt and then enters into a receivefixed payvariablerate interest rate swap with the same tenor and notional amount to synthetically convert the interest payments to a net variablerate basis this strategy is the most common form of an interest rate hedge as it minimizes net interest cost in certain yield curve environments derivatives are also used to manage market risks inherent in specific groups of onbalance sheet assets and liabilities including afs securities commodities and borrowings as well as other interestsensitive assets and liabilities in addition foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge nonus dollardenominated debt foreign currencydenominated afs securities and net investment exposures derivatives may expose citigroup to market credit or liquidity risks in excess of the amounts recorded on the consolidated balance sheet market risk on a derivative product is the exposure created by potential fluctuations in interest rates market prices foreign exchange rates and other factors and is a function of the type of product the volume of transactions the tenor and terms of the agreement and the underlying volatility credit risk is the exposure to loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to satisfy a derivative liability where the value of any collateral held by citi is not adequate to cover such losses the recognition in earnings of unrealized gains on derivative transactions is subject to managements assessment of the probability of counterparty default liquidity risk is the potential exposure that arises when the size of a derivative position may affect the ability to monetize the position in a reasonable period of time and at a reasonable cost in periods of high volatility and financial stress derivative transactions are customarily documented under industry standard master netting agreements which provide that following an event of default the nondefaulting party may promptly terminate all transactions between the parties and determine the net amount due to be paid to or by the defaulting party events of default include i failure to make a payment on a derivative transaction that remains uncured following applicable notice and grace periods ii breach of agreement that remains uncured after applicable notice and grace periods iii breach of a representation iv cross default either to thirdparty debt or to other derivative transactions entered into between the parties or in some cases their affiliates v the occurrence of a merger or consolidation that results in the creditworthiness of a party becoming materially weaker and vi the cessation or repudiation of any applicable guarantee or other credit support document obligations under master netting agreements are often secured by collateral posted under an industry standard credit support annex to the master netting agreement an event of default may also occur under a credit support annex if a party fails to make a collateral delivery that remains uncured following applicable notice and grace periods the netting and collateral rights incorporated in the master netting agreements are considered to be legally enforceable if a supportive legal opinion has been obtained from counsel of recognized standing that provides i the requisite level of certainty regarding enforceability and ii that the exercise of rights by the nondefaulting party to terminate and closeout transactions on a net basis under these agreements will not be stayed or avoided under applicable law upon an event of default including bankruptcy insolvency or similar proceeding a legal opinion may not be sought for certain jurisdictions where local law is silent or unclear as to the enforceability of such rights or where adverse case law or conflicting regulation may cast doubt on the enforceability of such rights in some jurisdictions and for some counterparty types the insolvency law may not provide the requisite level of certainty for example this may be the case for certain sovereigns municipalities central banks and us pension plans exposure to credit risk on derivatives is affected by information pertaining to citigroups derivatives market volatility which may impair the ability of counterparties to satisfy their obligations to the company credit limits are established and closely monitored for customers engaged in derivatives transactions citi considers the level of legal certainty regarding enforceability of its offsetting rights under master netting agreements and credit support annexes to be an important factor in its risk management process specifically citi generally transacts much lower volumes of derivatives under master netting agreements where citi does not have the requisite level of legal certainty regarding enforceability because such derivatives consume greater amounts of single counterparty credit limits than those executed under enforceable master netting agreements cash collateral and security collateral in the form of g10 government debt securities are often posted by a party to a master netting agreement to secure the net open exposure of the other party the receiving party is free to commingle rehypothecate such collateral in the ordinary course of its business nonstandard collateral such as corporate bonds municipal bonds us agency securities andor mbs may also be pledged as collateral for derivative transactions security collateral posted to open and maintain a master netting agreement with a counterparty in the form of cash andor securities may from time to time be segregated in an account at a thirdparty custodian pursuant to a triparty account control agreement activities based on notional amounts is presented in the table below derivative notional amounts are reference amounts from which contractual payments are derived and do not represent a complete measure of citis exposure to derivative transactions citis derivative exposure arises primarily from market fluctuations ie market risk counterparty failure ie credit risk andor periods of high volatility or financial stress ie liquidity risk as well as any market valuation adjustments that may be required on the transactions moreover notional amounts do not reflect the netting of offsetting trades for example if citi enters into a receive fixed interest rate swap with million notional and offsets this risk with an identical but opposite payfixed position with a different counterparty million in derivative notionals is reported although these offsetting positions may result in de minimis overall market risk in addition aggregate derivative notional amounts can fluctuate from period to period in the normal course of business based on citis market share levels of client activity and other factors all derivatives are

december december credit derivatives are arrangements designed to allow one party protection purchaser to transfer the credit risk of a reference asset to another party protection seller these arrangements allow a protection seller to assume the credit risk associated with the reference asset without directly purchasing that asset the company enters into credit derivative positions for purposes such as risk management yield enhancement reduction of credit concentrations and diversification of overall risk the following tables present the gross and net fair values of the companys

tables reflect rule changes adopted by clearing organizations that require or allow entities to treat certain derivative assets liabilities and the related variation margin as settlement of the related derivative fair values for legal and accounting purposes as opposed to presenting gross derivative assets and liabilities that are subject to collateral whereby the counterparties would also

interest rate contracts foreign exchange total accounting for derivative hedging citigroup accounts for its hedging activities in accordance with asc derivatives and hedging as a general rule hedge accounting is permitted where the company is exposed to a particular risk such as interest rate or foreign exchange risk that causes changes in the fair value of an asset or liability or variability in the expected future cash flows of an existing asset liability or a forecasted transaction that may affect earnings derivative contracts hedging the risks associated with changes in fair value are referred to as fair value hedges while contracts hedging the variability of expected future cash flows are cash flow hedges hedges that utilize derivatives or debt instruments to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with equity investments in nonusdollarfunctional currency foreign subsidiaries ie net investment in a foreign operation are net investment hedges to qualify as an accounting hedge under the hedge accounting rules versus an economic hedge where hedge accounting is not applied a hedging relationship must be highly effective in offsetting the risk designated as being hedged the hedging relationship must be formally documented at inception detailing the particular risk management objective and strategy for the hedge this includes the item and risks being hedged the hedging instrument being used and how effectiveness will be assessed the effectiveness of these hedging relationships is evaluated at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis both on a retrospective and prospective basis typically using quantitative measures of correlation hedge effectiveness assessment methodologies are performed in a similar manner for similar hedges and are used consistently throughout the hedging relationships the assessment of effectiveness may exclude changes in the value of the hedged item that are unrelated to the risks being hedged and the changes in fair value of the derivative associated with time value discontinued hedge accounting a hedging instrument must be highly effective in accomplishing the hedge objective of offsetting either changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item for the risk being hedged management may voluntarily dedesignate an accounting hedge at any time but if a hedging relationship is not highly effective it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting and must be dedesignated subsequent changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in other revenue or principal transactions similar to trading derivatives with no offset recorded related to the hedged item for fair value hedges any changes in the carrying value of the hedged item remain as part of the basis of the asset or liability and are ultimately realized as an element of the yield on the item for cash flow hedges changes in fair value of the enduser derivative remain in accumulated other comprehensive income loss aoci and are included in the earnings of future periods when the forecasted hedged cash flows impact earnings however if it becomes probable that some or all of the hedged forecasted transactions will not occur any amounts that remain in aoci related to these transactions must be immediately reflected in other revenue the foregoing criteria are applied on a decentralized basis consistent with the level at which market risk is managed but are subject to various limits and controls the underlying asset liability or forecasted transaction may be an individual item or a portfolio of similar items fair value hedges hedging of benchmark interest rate risk citigroups fair value hedges which include hedges of closed pools of assets are primarily hedges of fixedrate longterm debt or assets such as availableforsale debt securities or loans for qualifying fair value hedges of interest rate risk the changes in the fair value of the derivative and the change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are presented within interest income or interest expense based on whether the hedged item is an asset or a liability hedging of foreign exchange risk citigroup hedges the change in fair value attributable to foreign exchange rate movements in availableforsale debt securities and longterm debt that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity holding the securities or issuing the debt the hedging instrument is generally a forward foreign exchange contract or a crosscurrency swap contract changes in the fair value of the forward points ie the spotforward difference of forward contracts are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are generally reflected directly in earnings over the life of the hedge citi also excludes changes in the fair value of crosscurrency basis associated with cross currency swaps from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and records them in other comprehensive income hedging of commodity price risk citigroup hedges the change in fair value attributable to spot price movements in physical commodities inventories the hedging instrument is a futures contract to sell the underlying commodity in this hedge the change in the carrying value of the hedged inventory is reflected in earnings which offsets the change in the fair value of the futures contract that is also reflected in earnings although the entire change in the fair value of the hedging instrument is recorded in earnings under certain hedge programs citigroup excludes changes in the fair value of the forward points ie spotforward difference of the futures contract from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and they are generally reflected directly in earnings over the life of the hedge under other hedge programs citi excludes changes in the fair value of forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and records them in other comprehensive income the following table summarizes the

years the aftertax impact of cash flow hedges on aoci is presented in note net investment hedges consistent with asc foreign currency matters foreign currency transactions asc allows the hedging of the foreign currency risk of a net investment in a foreign operation citigroup uses foreign currency forwards cross currency swaps options and foreign currencydenominated debt instruments to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with citigroups equity investments in several non usdollarfunctionalcurrency foreign subsidiaries citi records the change in the fair value of these hedging instruments and the translation adjustment for the investments in these foreign subsidiaries in foreign currency translation adjustment cta within aoci for derivatives designated as net investment hedges citigroup follows the forwardrate method outlined in asc according to that method all changes in fair value including changes related to the forwardrate component of the foreign currency forward contracts and the time value of foreign currency options are recorded in cta within aoci for foreign currencydenominated debt instruments that are designated as hedges of net investments the translation gain or loss that is recorded in cta is based on the spot exchange rate between the functional currency of the respective subsidiary and the us dollar which is the functional currency of citigroup the pretax gain loss recorded in cta within aoci related to net investment hedges was billion million and million for the years ended december and respectively the year ended december includes a million pretax loss related to net investment hedges respectively which were reclassified from aoci into earnings recorded in other revenue economic hedges citigroup often uses economic hedges when hedge accounting would be too complex or operationally burdensome enduser derivatives that are economic hedges are carried at fair value with changes in value included in either principal transactions or other revenue for assetliability management hedging fixedrate long term debt is recorded at amortized cost under gaap for other hedges that either do not meet the asc hedging criteria or for which management decides not to apply asc hedge accounting the derivative is recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with the associated changes in fair value recorded in earnings while the debt continues to be carried at amortized cost therefore current earnings are affected by the interest rate shifts and other factors that cause a change in the swaps value but for which no offsetting change in value is recorded on the debt citigroup may alternatively elect to account for the debt at fair value under the fair value option once the irrevocable election is made upon issuance of the debt the full change in fair value of the debt is reported in earnings the changes in fair value of the related interest rate swap are also reflected in earnings which provides a natural offset to the debts fair value change to the extent that the two amounts differ because the full change in the fair value of the debt includes risks not offset by the interest rate swap the difference is automatically captured in current earnings additional economic hedges include hedges of the credit risk component of commercial loans and loan commitments citigroup periodically evaluates its hedging strategies in other areas and may designate either an accounting hedge or an economic hedge after considering the relative costs and benefits economic hedges are also employed when the hedged item itself is markedtomarket through current earnings such as hedges of commitments to originate one to fourfamily mortgage loans to be hfs and msrs credit derivatives citi is a market maker and trades a range of credit derivatives through these contracts citi either purchases or writes protection on either a single name or a portfolio of reference credits citi also uses credit derivatives to help

contracts as of december and approximately and respectively of the gross receivables are from counterparties with which citi maintains master netting agreements collateral agreements or settles daily a majority of citis top counterparties by receivable balance owed to citi are central clearing houses banks financial institutions or other dealers contracts with these counterparties do not include ratingsbased termination events however counterparty ratings downgrades may have an incremental effect by lowering the threshold at which citi may call for additional collateral the range of credit derivatives entered into includes credit default swaps total return swaps credit options and credit linked notes a credit default swap is a contract in which for a fee a protection seller agrees to reimburse a protection buyer for any losses that occur due to a predefined credit event on a reference entity these credit events are defined by the terms of the derivative contract and the reference entity and are generally limited to the market standard of failure to pay on indebtedness and bankruptcy of the reference entity and in a more limited range of transactions debt restructuring credit derivative transactions that reference emerging market entities also typically include additional credit events to cover the acceleration of indebtedness and the risk of repudiation or a payment moratorium in certain transactions protection may be provided on a portfolio of reference entities or assetbacked securities if there is no credit event as defined by the specific derivative contract then the protection seller makes no payments to the protection buyer and receives only the contractually specified fee however if a credit event occurs as defined in the specific derivative contract sold the protection seller will be required to make a payment to the protection buyer under certain contracts the seller of protection may not be required to make a payment until a specified amount of losses has occurred with respect to the portfolio andor may only be required to pay for losses up to a specified amount a total return swap typically transfers the total economic performance of a reference asset which includes all associated cash flows as well as capital appreciation or depreciation the protection buyer receives a floating rate of interest and any depreciation on the reference asset from the protection seller and in return the protection seller receives the cash flows associated with the reference asset plus any appreciation thus according to the total return swap agreement the protection seller will be obligated to make a payment any time the floating interest rate payment plus any depreciation of the reference asset exceeds the cash flows associated with the underlying asset a total return swap may terminate upon a default of the reference asset or a credit event with respect to the reference entity subject to the provisions of the related total return swap agreement between the protection seller and the protection buyer a credit option is a credit derivative that allows investors to trade or hedge changes in the credit quality of a reference entity for example in a credit spread option the option writer assumes the obligation to purchase or sell credit protection on the reference entity at a specified strike spread level the option purchaser buys the right to sell credit default protection on the reference entity to or purchase it from the option writer at the strike spread level the payments on credit spread options depend either on a particular credit spread or the price of the underlying creditsensitive asset or other reference entity the options usually terminate if a credit event occurs with respect to the underlying reference entity a creditlinked note is a form of credit derivative structured as a debt security with an embedded credit default swap the purchaser of the note effectively provides credit protection to the issuer by agreeing to receive a return that could be negatively affected by credit events on the underlying reference entity if the reference entity defaults the note may be cash settled or physically settled by delivery of a debt security of the reference entity thus the maximum amount of the note purchasers exposure is the amount paid for the creditlinked note the following tables summarize the

under protection sold the fair value amount payable is composed of million under protection purchased and million under protection sold fair values included in the above tables are prior to application of any netting agreements and cash collateral for notional amounts citi generally has a mismatch between the total notional amounts of protection purchased and sold and it may hold the reference assets directly rather than entering into offsetting credit derivative contracts as and when desired the open risk exposures from credit derivative contracts are largely matched after certain cash positions in reference assets are considered and after notional amounts are adjusted either to a durationbased equivalent basis or to reflect the level of subordination in tranched structures the ratings of the credit derivatives portfolio presented in the tables and used to evaluate paymentperformance risk are based on the assigned internal or external ratings of the reference asset or entity where external ratings are used investmentgrade ratings are considered to be baabbb and above while anything below is considered noninvestment grade citis internal ratings are in line with the related external rating system citigroup evaluates the paymentperformance risk of the credit derivatives for which it stands as a protection seller based on the credit rating assigned to the underlying reference credit credit derivatives written on an underlying non investmentgrade reference entity represent greater payment risk to the company the noninvestmentgrade category in the table above also includes credit derivatives where the underlying reference entity has been downgraded subsequent to the inception of the derivative the maximum potential amount of future payments under credit derivative contracts presented in the table above is based on the notional value of the derivatives the company believes that the notional amount for credit protection sold is not representative of the actual loss exposure based on historical experience this amount has not been reduced by the value of the reference assets and the related cash flows in accordance with most credit derivative contracts should a credit event occur the company usually is liable for the difference between the protection sold and the value of the reference assets furthermore the notional amount for credit protection sold has not been reduced for any cash collateral paid to a given counterparty as such payments would be calculated after netting all derivative exposures including any credit derivatives with that counterparty in accordance with a related master netting agreement due to such netting processes determining the amount of collateral that corresponds to credit derivative exposures alone is not possible the company actively monitors open creditrisk exposures and manages this exposure by using a variety of strategies including purchased credit derivatives cash collateral or direct holdings of the referenced assets this risk mitigation activity is not captured in the table above credit riskrelated contingent features in derivatives certain derivative instruments contain provisions that require the company to either post additional collateral or immediately settle any outstanding liability balances upon the occurrence of a specified event related to the credit risk of the company these events which are defined by the existing derivative contracts are primarily downgrades in the credit ratings of the company and its affiliates the fair value excluding cva of all derivative instruments with credit riskrelated contingent features that were in a net liability position at december and was billion and billion respectively the company posted billion and billion as collateral for this exposure in the normal course of business as of december and respectively a downgrade could trigger additional collateral or cash settlement requirements for the company and certain affiliates in the event that citigroup and citibank were downgraded a single notch by all three major rating agencies as of december the company could be required to post an additional billion as either collateral or settlement of the derivative transactions in addition the company could be required to segregate with thirdparty custodians collateral previously received from existing derivative counterparties in the amount of million upon the single notch downgrade resulting in aggregate cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately billion derivatives accompanied by financial asset transfers the company executes total return swaps that provide it with synthetic exposure to substantially all of the economic return of the securities or other financial assets referenced in the contract in certain cases the derivative transaction is accompanied by the companys transfer of the referenced financial asset to the derivative counterparty most typically in response to the derivative counterpartys desire to hedge in whole or in part its synthetic exposure under the derivative contract by holding the referenced asset in funded form in certain jurisdictions these transactions qualify as sales resulting in derecognition of the securities transferred see note for further discussion of the related sale conditions for transfers of financial assets for a significant portion of the transactions the company has also executed another total return swap where the company passes on substantially all of the economic return of the referenced securities to a different third party seeking the exposure in those cases the company is not exposed on a net basis to changes in the economic return of the referenced securities these transactions generally involve the transfer of the companys liquid government bonds convertible bonds or publicly traded corporate equity securities from the trading portfolio and are executed with thirdparty financial institutions the accompanying derivatives are typically total return swaps the derivatives are cash settled and subject to ongoing margin requirements when the conditions for sale accounting are met the company reports the transfer of the referenced financial asset as a sale and separately reports the accompanying derivative transaction these transactions generally do not result in a gain or loss on the sale of the security because the transferred security was held at fair value in the companys trading portfolio for transfers of financial assets accounted for as a sale by the company and for which the company has retained substantially all of the economic exposure to the transferred asset through a total return swap executed with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial sale and still outstanding the asset amounts derecognized and the gross cash proceeds received as of the date of derecognition were billion and billion as of december and respectively at december the fair value of these previously derecognized assets was billion the fair value of the total return swaps as of december was million recorded as gross derivative assets and million recorded as gross derivative liabilities at december the fair value of these previously derecognized assets was billion and the fair value of the total return swaps was million recorded as gross derivative assets and million recorded as gross derivative liabilities the balances for the total return swaps are on a gross basis before the application of counterparty and cash collateral netting and are included primarily as equity derivatives in the tabular disclosures in this note concentrations of credit risk concentrations of credit risk exist when changes in economic industry or geographic factors similarly affect groups of counterparties whose aggregate credit exposure is material in relation to citigroups total credit exposure although citigroups portfolio of financial instruments is broadly diversified along industry product and geographic lines material transactions are completed with other financial institutions particularly in the securities trading derivatives and foreign exchange businesses in connection with the companys efforts to maintain a diversified portfolio the company limits its exposure to any one geographic region country or individual creditor and monitors this exposure on a continuous basis at december citigroups most significant concentration of credit risk was with the us government and its agencies the companys exposure which primarily results from trading assets and investments issued by the us government and its agencies amounted to billion and billion at december and respectively the german mexican japanese and united kingdom governments and their agencies which are rated investment grade by both moodys and sp were the next largest exposures the companys exposure to germany amounted to billion and billion at december and respectively the companys exposure to mexico amounted to billion and billion at december and respectively the companys exposure to japan amounted to billion and billion at december and respectively the companys exposure to the united kingdom amounted to billion and billion at december and respectively the foreign government exposures are composed of investment securities loans and trading assets the companys exposure to states and municipalities amounted to billion and billion at december and respectively and was composed of trading assets investment securities derivatives and lending activities fair value measurement asc fair value measurement defines fair value establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures about fair value measurements fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and therefore represents an exit price among other things the standard requires the company to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value under asc the probability of counterparty default is factored into the valuation of derivatives and other positions and the impact of citigroups own credit risk is factored into the valuation of derivatives and other liabilities that are measured at fair value fair value hierarchy asc specifies a hierarchy of inputs based on whether the inputs are observable or unobservable observable inputs are developed using market data and reflect market participant assumptions while unobservable inputs reflect the companys market assumptions these two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy level quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets level quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and modelderived valuations in which all significant inputs and value drivers are observable in the market level valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable as required under the fair value hierarchy the company considers relevant and observable market inputs in its valuations where possible the fair value hierarchy classification approach typically utilizes rulesbased and datadriven criteria to determine whether an instrument is classified as level level or level the determination of whether an instrument is quoted in an active market and therefore considered a level instrument is based upon the frequency of observed transactions and the quality of independent market data available on the measurement date a level classification is assigned where there is observability of pricesmarket inputs to models or where any unobservable inputs are not significant to the valuation the determination of whether an input is considered observable is based on the availability of independent market data and its corroboration for example through observed transactions in the market otherwise an instrument is classified as level determination of fair value for assets and liabilities carried at fair value the company measures fair value using the procedures set out below irrespective of whether the assets and liabilities are measured at fair value as a result of an election a nonrecurring lower ofcostormarket locom adjustment or because they are required to be measured at fair value when available the company uses quoted market prices from active markets to determine fair value and classifies such items as level in some specific cases where a market price is available the company will apply practical expedients such as matrix pricing to calculate fair value in which case the items may be classified as level the company may also apply a pricebased methodology that utilizes where available quoted prices or other market information obtained from recent trading activity in positions with the same or similar characteristics to the position being valued if relevant and observable prices are available those valuations may be classified as level however when there are one or more significant unobservable price inputs those valuations will be classified as level furthermore when a quoted price is considered stale a significant adjustment to the price of a similar security is necessary to reflect differences in the terms of the actual security being valued or alternatively when prices from independent sources are insufficient to corroborate a valuation the price inputs are considered unobservable and the fair value measurements are classified as level if quoted market prices are not available fair value is based upon internally developed valuation techniques that use where possible current marketbased parameters such as interest rates currency rates and option volatilities items valued using such internally generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation thus an item may be classified as level even though there may be some significant inputs that are readily observable fair value estimates from internal valuation techniques are verified where possible to prices obtained from independent vendors or brokers vendor and broker valuations may be based on a variety of inputs ranging from observed prices to proprietary valuation models and the company assesses the quality and relevance of this information in determining the estimate of fair value the following section describes the valuation methodologies used by the company to measure various financial instruments at fair value where appropriate the description includes details of the valuation models the key inputs to those models and any significant assumptions market valuation adjustments generally the unit of account for a financial instrument is the individual financial instrument the company applies market valuation adjustments that are consistent with the unit of account which do not include adjustments due to the size of the companys position except as follows asc permits an exception through an accounting policy election to measure the fair value of a portfolio of financial assets and financial liabilities on the basis of the net open risk position when certain criteria are met citi has elected to measure own credit cva is determined using citispecific cds spreads for the relevant tenor generally counterparty cva is determined using cds spread indices for each credit rating and tenor for certain identified netting sets where individual analysis is practicable eg exposures to counterparties with liquid cdss counterpartyspecific cds spreads are used for fva a term structure of spreads is applied to the expected funding exposures eg the market liquidity spread used to represent the term funding premium associated with certain otc derivatives the cva and fva are designed to incorporate a market view of the credit and funding risk respectively inherent in the derivative portfolio however most unsecured derivative instruments are negotiated bilateral contracts and are not commonly transferred to third parties derivative instruments are normally settled contractually or if terminated early are terminated at a value negotiated bilaterally between the parties thus the cva and fva may not be realized upon a settlement or termination in the normal course of business in addition all or a portion of these adjustments may be reversed or otherwise adjusted in future periods in the event of changes in the credit or funding risk associated with the derivative instruments the table below summarizes the cva and fva applied to the fair value of derivative instruments at december and in millions of dollars counterparty cva asset fva citigroup own credit cva liability fva total cva and fva derivative instruments credit and funding valuation adjustments contraliability contraasset december december certain portfolios of financial instruments that meet those criteria such as derivatives on the basis of the net open risk position the company applies market valuation adjustments including adjustments to account for the size of the net open risk position consistent with market participant assumptions valuation adjustments are applied to items classified as level or level in the fair value hierarchy to ensure that the fair value reflects the price at which the net open risk position could be exited these valuation adjustments are based on the bidoffer spread for an instrument in the market when citi has elected to measure certain portfolios of financial investments such as derivatives on the basis of the net open risk position the valuation adjustment may take into account the size of the position credit valuation adjustments cva and funding valuation adjustments fva are applied to certain overthe counter otc derivative instruments where adjustments to reflect counterparty credit risk own credit risk and term funding risk are required to estimate fair value this principally includes derivatives with a base valuation eg discounted using overnight indexed swap ois requiring adjustment for these effects such as uncollateralized interest rate swaps the cva represents a portfoliolevel adjustment to reflect the risk premium associated with the counterpartys assets or citis liabilities nonperformance risk the fva represents a market funding risk premium inherent in the uncollateralized portion of a derivative portfolio and in certain collateralized derivative portfolios that do not include standard credit support annexes csas such as where the csa does not permit the reuse of collateral received citis fva methodology leverages the existing cva methodology to estimate a funding exposure profile the calculation of this exposure profile considers collateral agreements in which the terms do not permit the company to reuse the collateral received including where counterparties post collateral to thirdparty custodians citis cva and fva methodologies consist of two steps first the exposure profile for each counterparty is determined using the terms of all individual derivative positions and a monte carlo simulation or other quantitative analysis to generate a series of expected cash flows at future points in time the calculation of this exposure profile considers the effect of credit risk mitigants and sources of funding including pledged cash or other collateral and any legal right of offset that exists with a counterparty through arrangements such as netting agreements individual derivative contracts that are subject to an enforceable master netting agreement with a counterparty are aggregated as a netting set for this purpose since it is those net cash flows that are subject to nonperformance risk this process identifies specific pointintime future cash flows that are subject to nonperformance and term funding risk rather than using the current recognized net asset or liability as a basis to measure the cva and fva second for cva marketbased views of default probabilities derived from observed credit spreads in the credit default swap cds

based on the terms of the contract taking into account any embedded derivatives or other features these cash flows are discounted using interest rates appropriate to the maturity of the instrument as well as the nature of the underlying collateral generally when such instruments are recorded at fair value they are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy as the inputs used in the valuation are readily observable however certain long dated positions are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy trading account assets and liabilitiestrading securities and trading loans when available the company uses quoted market prices in active markets to determine the fair value of trading securities such items are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy examples include government securities and exchangetraded equity securities for bonds and secondary market loans traded over the counter the company generally determines fair value utilizing various valuation techniques including discounted cash flows pricebased and internal models fair value estimates from these internal valuation techniques are verified where possible to prices obtained from independent sources including thirdparty vendors a pricebased methodology utilizes where available quoted prices or other market information obtained from recent trading activity of instruments with similar characteristics to the bond or loan being valued the yields used in discounted cash flow models are derived from the same price information trading securities and loans priced using such methods are generally classified as level however when the primary inputs to the valuation are unobservable or prices from independent sources are insufficient to corroborate valuation a loan or security is generally classified as level fair value estimates from these internal valuation techniques are verified where possible to prices obtained from independent sources including thirdparty vendors when the companys principal exit market for a portfolio of loans is through securitization the company uses the securitization price as a key input into the fair value of the loan portfolio the securitization price is determined from the assumed proceeds of a hypothetical securitization within the current market environment where such a price verification is possible loan portfolios are typically classified within level of the fair value hierarchy for most of the subprime mortgage backed security mbs exposures fair value is determined utilizing observable transactions where available or other valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis utilizing valuation assumptions derived from similar more observable securities as market proxies the valuation of certain assetbacked security abs cdo positions is inferred through the net asset value of the underlying assets of the abs cdo trading account assets and liabilitiesderivatives exchangetraded derivatives measured at fair value using quoted ie exchange prices in active markets where available are classified as level within the fair value hierarchy derivatives without a quoted price in an active market and derivatives executed over the counter are valued using internal valuation techniques these derivative instruments are classified as either level or level depending on the observability of the significant inputs to the valuation the valuation techniques depend on the type of derivative and the nature of the underlying instrument the principal techniques used to value these instruments are discounted cash flows and internal models such as derivative pricing models eg blackscholes and monte carlo simulations the key inputs depend upon the type of derivative and the nature of the underlying instrument and include interest rate yield curves foreign exchange rates volatilities and correlation investments the investments category includes availableforsale debt and marketable equity securities whose fair values are generally determined by utilizing similar procedures described for trading securities above or in some cases using vendor pricing as the primary source also included in investments are nonpublic investments in private equity and real estate entities determining the fair value of nonpublic securities involves a significant degree of management judgment as no quoted prices exist and such securities are not generally traded in addition there may be transfer restrictions on private equity securities the companys process for determining the fair value of such securities utilizes commonly accepted valuation techniques including guideline public company analysis and comparable transactions in determining the fair value of nonpublic securities the company also considers events such as a proposed sale of the investee company initial public offerings equity issuances or other observable transactions private equity securities are generally classified within level of the fair value hierarchy shortterm borrowings and longterm debt where fair value accounting has been elected the fair value of nonstructured liabilities is determined by utilizing internal models using the appropriate discount rate for the applicable maturity such instruments are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy when all significant inputs are readily observable the company determines the fair value of hybrid financial instruments including structured liabilities using the appropriate derivative valuation methodology described above in trading account assets and liabilities derivatives given the nature of the embedded risk profile such instruments are classified within level or level depending on the observability of significant inputs to the valuation items measured at fair value on a recurring basis the following tables present for each of the fair value hierarchy levels the companys assets and liabilities that are measured

there is either a constant input applied to all positions or the methodology involving the input applies to only one large position weighted averages are calculated based on the fair values of the instruments for equity securities the price inputs are expressed on an absolute basis not as a percentage of the notional amount both trading and nontrading account derivativesassets and liabilitiesare presented on a gross absolute value basis includes hybrid products uncertainty of fair value measurements relating to unobservable inputs valuation uncertainty arises when there is insufficient or dispersed market data to allow a precise determination of the exit value of a fairvalued position or portfolio in todays market this is especially prevalent in level fair value instruments where uncertainty exists in valuation inputs that may be both unobservable and significant to the instruments or portfolios overall fair value measurement the uncertainties associated with key unobservable inputs on the level fair value measurements may not be independent of one another in addition the amount and direction of the uncertainty on a fair value measurement for a given change in an unobservable input depends on the nature of the instrument as well as whether the company holds the instrument as an asset or a liability for certain instruments the pricing hedging and risk management are sensitive to the correlation between various inputs rather than on the analysis and aggregation of the individual inputs the following section describes some of the most significant unobservable inputs used by the company in level fair value measurements correlation correlation is a measure of the extent to which two or more variables change in relation to each other a variety of correlationrelated assumptions are required for a wide range of instruments including equity and credit baskets foreign exchange options credit index tranches and many other instruments for almost all of these instruments correlations are not directly observable in the market and must be calculated using alternative sources including historical information estimating correlation can be especially difficult where it may vary over time and calculating correlation information from market data requires significant assumptions regarding the informational efficiency of the market eg swaption markets uncertainty therefore exists when an estimate of the appropriate level of correlation as an input into some fair value measurements is required changes in correlation levels can have a substantial impact favorable or unfavorable on the value of an instrument depending on its nature a change in the default correlation of the fair value of the underlying bonds comprising a cdo structure would affect the fair value of the senior tranche for example an increase in the default correlation of the underlying bonds would reduce the fair value of the senior tranche because highly correlated instruments produce greater losses in the event of default and a portion of these losses would become attributable to the senior tranche that same change in default correlation would have a different impact on junior tranches of the same structure volatility volatility represents the speed and severity of market price changes and is a key factor in pricing options volatility generally depends on the tenor of the underlying instrument and the strike price or level defined in the contract volatilities for certain combinations of tenor and strike are not observable and need to be estimated using alternative methods such as comparable instruments historical analysis or other sources of market information this leads to uncertainty around the final fair value measurement of instruments with unobservable volatilities the general relationship between changes in the value of an instrument or a portfolio to changes in volatility also depends on changes in interest rates and the level of the underlying index generally long option positions assets benefit from increases in volatility whereas short option positions liabilities will suffer losses some instruments are more sensitive to changes in volatility than others for example an atthemoney option would experience a greater percentage change in its fair value than a deepinthemoney option in addition the fair value of an option with more than one underlying security eg an option on a basket of equities depends on the volatility of the individual underlying securities as well as their correlations yield in some circumstances the yield of an instrument is not observable in the market and must be estimated from historical data or from yields of similar securities this estimated yield may need to be adjusted to capture the characteristics of the security being valued whenever the amount of the adjustment is significant to the value of the security the fair value measurement is classified as level adjusted yield is generally used to discount the projected future principal and interest cash flows on instruments such as assetbacked securities adjusted yield is impacted by changes in the interest rate environment and relevant credit spreads prepayment voluntary unscheduled payments prepayments change the future cash flows for the investor and thereby change the fair value of the security the effect of prepayments is more pronounced for residential mortgagebacked securities prepayment is generally negatively correlated with delinquency and interest rate a combination of low prepayments and high delinquencies amplifies each inputs negative impact on a mortgage securitys valuation as prepayment speeds change the weightedaverage life of the security changes which impacts the valuation either positively or negatively depending upon the nature of the security and the direction of the change in the weightedaverage life recovery recovery is the proportion of the total outstanding balance of a bond or loan that is expected to be collected in a liquidation scenario for many credit securities eg commercial mortgagebacked securities the expected recovery amount of a defaulted property is typically unknown until a liquidation of the property is imminent the assumed recovery of a security may differ from its actual recovery that will be observable in the future generally an increase in the recovery rate assumption increases the fair value of the security an increase in loss severity the inverse of the recovery rate reduces the amount of principal available for distribution and as a result decreases the fair value of the security the fair value of loans hfs is determined where possible using quoted secondarymarket prices if no such quoted price exists the fair value of a loan is determined using quoted prices for a similar asset or assets adjusted for the specific attributes of that loan fair value for the other real estate owned is based on appraisals for loans whose carrying amount is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral the fair values depend on the type of collateral fair value of the collateral is typically estimated based on quoted market prices if available appraisals or other internal valuation techniques where the fair value of the related collateral is based on an appraised value the loan is generally classified as level in addition for corporate loans appraisals of the collateral are often based on sales of similar assets however because the prices of similar assets require significant adjustments to reflect the unique features of the underlying collateral these fair value measurements are generally classified as level the fair value of nonmarketable equity securities under the measurement alternative is based on observed transaction prices for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer or an internal valuation technique in the case of an impairment where there are insufficient market observations to conclude the inputs are observable where significant adjustments are made to the observed transaction prices or when an internal valuation technique is used the security is classified as level fair value may differ from the observed transaction price due to a number of factors including marketability adjustments and differences in rights and obligations when the observed transaction is not for the identical investment held by citi credit spread credit spread is a component of the security representing its credit quality credit spread reflects the market perception of changes in prepayment delinquency and recovery rates therefore capturing the impact of other variables on the fair value changes in credit spread affect the fair value of securities differently depending on the characteristics and maturity profile of the security for example credit spread is a more significant driver of the fair value measurement of a highyield bond as compared to an investmentgrade bond generally the credit spread for an investmentgrade bond is also more observable and less volatile than its highyield counterpart items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and therefore are not included in the tables above these include assets measured at cost that have been written down to fair value during the periods as a result of an impairment these also include nonmarketable equity securities that have been measured using the measurement alternative and are either i written down to fair value during the periods as a result of an impairment or ii adjusted upward or downward to fair value as a result of a transaction observed during the periods for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer in addition these assets include loans heldfor sale and other real estate owned that are measured at the lower of cost or market value the following tables present the carrying amounts of all

adjustments dva own debt valuation adjustments are recognized on citis liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected using citis credit spreads observed in the bond market changes in fair value of fair value option liabilities related to changes in citigroups own credit spreads dva are reflected as a component of aoci see note for additional information among other variables the fair value of liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected other than non recourse debt and similar liabilities is impacted by the narrowing or widening of the companys credit spreads the estimated changes in the fair value of these non derivative liabilities due to such changes in the companys own credit spread or instrumentspecific credit risk were a loss of million and gain of million for the years ended december and respectively changes in fair value resulting from changes in instrumentspecific credit risk were estimated by incorporating the companys current credit spreads observable in the bond market into the relevant valuation technique used to value each liability as described above the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities selected portfolios of securities purchased under agreements to resell securities borrowed securities sold under agreements to repurchase securities loaned and certain uncollateralized shortterm borrowings the company elected the fair value option for certain portfolios of fixed income securities purchased under agreements to resell and fixed income securities sold under agreements to repurchase securities borrowed securities loaned and certain uncollateralized shortterm borrowings held primarily by brokerdealer entities in the united states the united kingdom and japan in each case the election was made because the related interest rate risk is managed on a portfolio basis primarily with offsetting derivative instruments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings changes in fair value for transactions in these portfolios are recorded in principal transactions the related interest income and interest expense are measured based on the contractual rates specified in the transactions and are reported as interest income and interest expense in the consolidated statement of income certain loans and other credit products citigroup has also elected the fair value option for certain other originated and purchased loans including certain unfunded loan products such as guarantees and letters of credit executed by citigroups lending and trading businesses none of these credit products are highly leveraged financing commitments significant groups of transactions include loans and unfunded loan products that are expected to be either sold or securitized in the near term or transactions where the economic risks are hedged with derivative instruments such as purchased credit default swaps or total return swaps where the company pays the total return on the underlying loans to a third party citigroup has elected the fair value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational simplifications fair value was not elected for most lending transactions across the company the following table provides information about certain credit products carried at fair value in millions of dollars december december trading assets loans trading assets loans carrying amount reported on the consolidated balance sheet aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of less than fair value balance of nonaccrual loans or loans more than days past due aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of less than fair value for nonaccrual loans or loans more than days past due in addition to the amounts reported above million and million of unfunded commitments related to certain credit products selected for fair value accounting were outstanding as of december and respectively changes in the fair value of funded and unfunded credit products are classified in principal transactions in citis consolidated statement of income related interest income is measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as interest income on trading account assets or loan interest depending on the balance sheet classifications of the credit products the changes in fair value for the years ended december and due to instrumentspecific credit risk totaled to a gain of million and loss of million respectively changes in fair value due to instrumentspecific credit risk are estimated based on changes in borrowerspecific credit spreads and recovery assumptions certain investments in unallocated precious metals citigroup invests in unallocated precious metals accounts eg gold silver platinum and palladium as part of its commodity trading activities under asc the investment is bifurcated into a debt host contract and a commodity derivative instrument citigroup elects the fair value option for the debt host contract and reports the contract within trading account assets on the companys consolidated balance sheet the total carrying amount of debt host contracts across unallocated precious metals accounts was approximately billion and billion at december and respectively as part of its commodity trading activities citi trades unallocated precious metals investments and executes forward purchase and forward sale derivative contracts with trading counterparties when citi sells an unallocated precious metals investment citis receivable from its depository bank is repaid and citi derecognizes its investment in the unallocated precious metal the forward purchase or sale contract with the trading counterparty indexed to unallocated precious metals is accounted for as a derivative at fair value through earnings certain mortgage loans heldforsale hfs citigroup has elected the fair value option for certain purchased and originated prime fixedrate and conforming adjustablerate first mortgage loans hfs these loans are intended for sale or securitization and are economically hedged with derivative instruments the company has elected the fair value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational simplifications the following table provides information about certain mortgage loans hfs carried at fair value december december in millions of dollars carrying amount reported on the consolidated balance sheet aggregate fair value in excess of less than unpaid principal balance balance of nonaccrual loans or loans more than days past due aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of fair value for nonaccrual loans or loans more than days past due the changes in the fair values of these mortgage loans are reported in other revenue in the companys consolidated statement of income there was no net change in fair value during the years ended december and due to instrumentspecific credit risk changes in fair value due to instrumentspecific credit risk are estimated based on changes in the borrower default prepayment and recovery forecasts in addition to instrumentspecific credit spread related interest income continues to be measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as interest revenue in the consolidated statement of income certain debt liabilities the company has elected the fair value option for certain debt liabilities because these exposures are considered to be tradingrelated positions and therefore are managed on a fair value basis these positions are classified as longterm debt or shortterm borrowings on the companys consolidated balance sheet the following table provides information about the carrying value of notes carried at fair value disaggregated by type of risk in billions of dollars interest rate linked foreign exchange linked equity linked commodity linked credit linked total december december the portion of the changes in fair value attributable to changes in citigroups own credit spreads dva is reflected as a component of aoci while all other changes in fair value are reported in principal transactions changes in the fair value of these liabilities include accrued interest which is also included in the change in fair value reported in principal transactions certain nonstructured liabilities the company has elected the fair value option for certain non structured liabilities with fixed and floating interest rates the company has elected the fair value option where the interest rate risk of such liabilities may be economically hedged with derivative contracts or the proceeds are used to purchase financial assets that will also be accounted for at fair value through earnings the elections have been made to mitigate accounting mismatches and to achieve operational simplifications these positions are reported in shortterm borrowings and longterm debt on the companys consolidated balance sheet the portion of the changes in fair value attributable to changes in citigroups own credit spreads ie dva is reflected as a component of aoci while all other changes in fair value are reported in
