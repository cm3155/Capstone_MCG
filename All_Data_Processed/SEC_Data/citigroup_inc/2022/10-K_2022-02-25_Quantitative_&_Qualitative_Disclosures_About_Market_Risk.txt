corporate nonaccrual loans were billion billion and billion as of december september and december respectively of these approximately and were performing at december september and december respectively consumer nonaccrual status is generally based on aging ie the borrower has fallen behind on payments consumer mortgage loans other than federal housing administration fha insured loans are classified as nonaccrual within days of notification that the borrower has filed for bankruptcy in addition home equity loans are classified as nonaccrual if the related residential first mortgage

liquidity risks arise from several factors many of which are mostly or entirely outside citis control such as disruptions in the financial markets changes in key funding sources credit spreads changes in citis credit ratings and macroeconomic geopolitical and other conditions for additional information see risk factorsliquidity risks above citis funding and liquidity management objectives are aimed at i funding its existing asset base ii growing its core businesses iii maintaining sufficient liquidity structured appropriately so that citi can operate under a variety of adverse circumstances including potential companyspecific andor market liquidity events in varying durations and severity and iv satisfying regulatory requirements including among other things those related to resolution planning for additional information see resolution plan and total lossabsorbing capacity tlac below citigroups primary liquidity objectives are established by entity and in aggregate across two major

primary intermediate holding company citicorp llc citis brokerdealer subsidiaries including citigroup global markets inc citigroup global markets limited and citigroup global markets japan inc and other bank and nonbank subsidiaries that are consolidated into citigroup including citibanamex at an aggregate citigroup level citis goal is to maintain sufficient funding in amount and tenor to fully fund customer assets and to provide an appropriate amount of cash and high quality liquid assets as discussed below even in times of stress in order to meet its payment obligations as they come due the liquidity risk management framework provides that in addition to the aggregate requirements certain entities be selfsufficient or net providers of liquidity including in conditions established under their designated stress tests citis primary funding sources include i corporate and consumer deposits via citis bank subsidiaries including citibank na citibank ii longterm debt primarily senior and subordinated debt mainly issued by citigroup inc as the parent and citibank and iii stockholders equity these sources may be supplemented by shortterm borrowings primarily in the form of secured funding transactions as referenced above citis funding and liquidity framework ensures that the tenor of these funding sources is of sufficient term in relation to the tenor of its asset base the goal of citis assetliability management is to ensure that there is sufficient liquidity and tenor in the liability structure relative to the liquidity profile of the assets this reduces the risk that liabilities will become due before assets mature or are monetized this excess liquidity is held primarily in the form of highquality liquid assets hqla as set forth in the table below citis liquidity is managed via a centralized treasury model by treasury in conjunction with regional and in country treasurers with oversight provided by independent risk management and various asset liability committees alcos at the citigroup region country and business levels pursuant to this approach citis hqla is managed with emphasis on assetliability management and entitylevel liquidity adequacy throughout citi citis cro and chief financial officer cochair citigroups alco which includes citis treasurer and other senior executives the alco sets the strategy of the liquidity portfolio and monitors portfolio performance for additional information about the alco see risk governanceboard and executive management committees above significant changes to portfolio asset allocations are approved by the alco citi also has other alcos which are established at various organizational levels to ensure appropriate oversight for countries franchise businesses and regions serving as the primary governance committees for managing citis balance sheet and liquidity as a supplement to alco citis funding and liquidity risk committee flrc is a more focused assembly for funding and liquidity risk matters the flrc reviews and discusses the funding and liquidity risk profile of as well as risk management practices for citigroup and citibank and reports its findings and recommendations to each relevant alco as appropriate liquidity monitoring and measurement stress testing liquidity stress testing is performed for each of citis major entities operating subsidiaries andor countries stress testing and scenario analyses are intended to quantify the potential impact of an adverse liquidity event on the balance sheet and liquidity position and to identify viable funding alternatives that can be utilized these scenarios include assumptions about significant changes in key funding sources market triggers such as credit ratings potential uses of funding and macroeconomic geopolitical and other conditions these conditions include expected and stressed market conditions as well as companyspecific events liquidity stress tests are performed to ascertain potential mismatches between liquidity sources and uses over a variety of time horizons and over different stressed conditions to monitor the liquidity of an entity these stress tests and potential mismatches are calculated with varying frequencies with several tests performed daily given the range of potential stresses citi maintains contingency funding plans on a consolidated basis and for

weighted average maturity of citis secured funding of less liquid securities inventory was greater than days as of december citi manages the risks in its secured funding by conducting daily stress tests to account for changes in capacity tenor haircut collateral profile and client actions in addition citi maintains counterparty diversification by establishing concentration triggers and assessing counterparty reliability and stability under stress citi generally sources secured funding from more than counterparties shortterm borrowings citis shortterm borrowings of billion as of the

further information on citigroups and its affiliates outstanding shortterm borrowings credit ratings citigroups funding and liquidity funding capacity ability to access capital markets and other sources of funds the cost of these funds and its ability to maintain certain deposits are partially dependent on its credit ratings the table below shows the ratings for citigroup and citibank as of

as of december fitch ratings moodys investors service sp global ratings potential impacts of ratings downgrades ratings downgrades by moodys fitch or sp global ratings could negatively impact citigroups andor citibanks funding and liquidity due to reduced funding capacity including derivative triggers which could take the form of cash obligations and collateral requirements the following information is provided for the purpose of analyzing the potential funding and liquidity impact to citigroup and citibank of a hypothetical simultaneous ratings downgrade across all three major rating agencies this analysis is subject to certain estimates estimation methodologies judgments and uncertainties uncertainties include potential ratings limitations that certain entities may have with respect to permissible counterparties as well as general subjective counterparty behavior for example certain corporate customers and markets counterparties could re evaluate their business relationships with citi and limit transactions in certain contracts or market instruments with citi changes in counterparty behavior could impact citis funding and liquidity as well as the results of operations of certain of its businesses the actual impact to citigroup or citibank is unpredictable and may differ materially from the potential funding and liquidity impacts described below for

citibanks funding and liquidity due to derivative triggers by approximately billion compared to billion as of september other funding sources such as secured financing transactions and other margin requirements for which there are no explicit triggers could also be adversely affected in total as of december citi estimates that a onenotch downgrade of citigroup and citibank across all three major rating agencies could result in increased aggregate cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately billion compared to billion as of september see also note to the consolidated financial statements as detailed under highquality liquid assets above citigroup has various liquidity resources available to its bank and nonbank entities in part as a contingency for the potential events described above in addition a broad range of mitigating actions are currently included in citigroups and citibanks contingency funding plans for citigroup these mitigating factors include but are not limited to accessing surplus funding capacity from existing clients tailoring levels of secured lending and adjusting the size of select trading books and collateralized borrowings at certain citibank subsidiaries mitigating actions available to citibank include but are not limited to selling or financing highly liquid government securities tailoring levels of secured lending adjusting the size of select trading assets reducing loan originations and renewals raising additional deposits or borrowing from the fhlb or central banks citi believes these mitigating actions could substantially reduce the funding and liquidity risk if any of the potential downgrades described above citibankadditional potential impacts in addition to the above derivative triggers citi believes that a potential downgrade of citibanks senior debtlongterm rating across any of the three major rating agencies could also have an adverse impact on the commercial papershortterm rating of citibank citibank has provided liquidity commitments to consolidated assetbacked commercial paper conduits primarily in the form of asset purchase agreements as of december citibank had liquidity commitments of approximately billion to consolidated assetbacked commercial paper conduits compared to billion as of september for additional information see note to the consolidated financial statements in addition to the abovereferenced liquidity resources of certain citibank entities citibank could reduce the funding and liquidity risk if any of the potential downgrades described above through mitigating actions including repricing or reducing certain commitments to commercial paper conduits in the event of the potential downgrades described above citi believes that certain corporate customers could reevaluate their deposit relationships with citibank this reevaluation could result in clients adjusting their discretionary deposit levels or changing their depository institution which could potentially reduce certain deposit levels at citibank however citi could choose to adjust pricing offer alternative deposit products to its existing customers or seek to attract deposits from new customers in addition to the mitigating actions referenced above assumptions the changes include among other things assumptions around the projected balance sheet being more static coupled with revisions to the treatment of certain business contributions to ire mainly accrual positions in icgs markets businesses these changes are planned for and will result in a higher impact to citis nii and aoci and a better reflection of the nature of the portfolios in order to manage changes in interest rates effectively citi may modify pricing on new customer loans and deposits purchase fixedrate securities issue debt that is either fixed or floating or enter into derivative transactions that have the opposite risk exposures citi regularly assesses the viability of these and other strategies to reduce its interest rate risks and implements such strategies when it believes those actions are prudent citi manages interest rate risk as a consolidated companywide position citis clientfacing businesses create interest ratesensitive positions including loans and deposits as part of their ongoing activities citi treasury aggregates these risk positions and manages them centrally operating within established limits citi treasury makes positioning decisions and uses tools such as citis investment securities portfolio companyissued debt and interest rate derivatives to target the desired risk profile changes in citis interest rate risk position reflect the accumulated changes in all nontrading assets and liabilities with potentially large and offsetting impacts as well as in citi treasurys positioning decisions citigroup employs additional measurements including stress testing the impact of nonlinear interest rate movements on the value of the balance sheet and the analysis of portfolio duration and volatility particularly as they relate to mortgage loans and mortgagebacked securities and the potential impact of the change in the spread between different market indices interest rate risk of investment portfoliosimpact on aoci citi also measures the potential impacts of changes in interest rates on the value of its aoci which can in turn impact citis common equity and tangible common equity this will impact citis common equity tier and other regulatory capital ratios citis goal is to benefit from an increase in the market level of interest rates while limiting the impact of changes in aoci on its regulatory capital position aoci at risk is managed as part of the companywide interest rate risk position aoci at risk considers potential changes in aoci and the corresponding impact on the common equity tier capital ratio relative to citis capital generation capacity market risk overview market risk is the potential for losses arising from changes in the value of citis assets and liabilities resulting from changes in market variables such as interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices commodity prices and credit spreads as well as their implied volatilities market risk emanates from both citis trading and nontrading portfolios for additional information on market risk and market risk management see risk factors above each business is required to establish with approval from citis market risk management a market risk limit framework for identified risk factors that clearly defines approved risk profiles and is within the parameters of citis overall risk appetite these limits are monitored by the risk organization including various regional legal entity and business risk management committees citis country and business asset liability committees and the citigroup risk management and asset liability committees in all cases the businesses are ultimately responsible for the market risks taken and for remaining within their defined limits market risk of nontrading portfolios market risk from nontrading portfolios stems from the potential impact of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on citis net interest income and on citis accumulated other comprehensive income loss aoci from its debt securities portfolios market risk from nontrading portfolios also includes the potential impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on citis capital invested in foreign currencies net interest income at risk net interest income for interest rate exposure purposes is the difference between the yield earned on the nontrading portfolio assets including customer loans and the rate paid on the liabilities including customer deposits or company borrowings net interest income is affected by changes in the level of interest rates as well as the amounts and mix of assets and liabilities and the timing of contractual and assumed repricing of assets and liabilities to reflect market rates citis principal measure of risk to net interest income is interest rate exposure ire ire measures the change in expected net interest income in each currency resulting solely from unanticipated changes in forward interest rates citis estimated ire incorporates various assumptions including prepayment rates on loans customer behavior and the impact of pricing decisions for example in rising interest rate scenarios portions of the deposit portfolio may be assumed to experience rate increases that are less than the change in market interest rates in declining interest rate scenarios it is assumed that mortgage portfolios experience higher prepayment rates citis estimated ire below assumes that its businesses andor citi treasury make no additional changes in balances or positioning in response to the unanticipated rate changes citi is planning to transition the sensitivity analysis for its ire see the current ire sensitivity impacts below employing enhanced methodologies and changes to certain the following table

changes in interest rates on aoci related to investment securities cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments the yearoveryear increase in the estimated impact to net interest income primarily reflected changes in citis balance sheet composition and citi treasury positioning the year overyear changes in the estimated impact to aoci and the common equity tier capital ratio primarily reflected the impact of the composition of citi treasurys investment and derivatives portfolio in the event of a parallel instantaneous bps increase in interest rates citi expects that the negative impact to aoci would be offset in shareholders equity through the expected recovery of the impact on aoci through accretion of citis investment portfolio over a period of time as of december citi expects that the billion negative impact to aoci in such a scenario could potentially be offset over approximately months the following table sets forth the estimated impact to citis net interest income aoci and the common equity tier capital ratio on a fully implemented basis under five different changes in interest rate scenarios for the us dollar and citis other currencies the bps downward

shown in the table above the magnitude of the impact to citis net interest income and aoci is greater under scenario as compared to scenario this is because the combination of changes to citis investment portfolio partially offset by changes related to citis pension liabilities results in a net position that is more sensitive to rates at shorter and intermediateterm maturities changes in foreign exchange ratesimpacts on aoci and capital as of december citi estimates that an unanticipated parallel instantaneous appreciation of the us dollar against all of the other currencies in which citi has invested capital could reduce citis tangible common equity tce by approximately billion or as a result of changes to citis fx translation adjustment in aoci net of hedges this impact would be primarily due to changes in the value of the mexican peso euro singapore dollar and indian rupee this impact is also before any mitigating actions citi may take including ongoing management of its fx translation exposure specifically as currency movements change the value of citis net investments in foreign currency denominated capital these movements also change the value of citis riskweighted assets denominated in those currencies this coupled with citis foreign currency hedging strategies such as foreign currency borrowings foreign currency forwards and other currency hedging instruments lessens the impact of foreign currency movements on citis common equity tier capital ratio changes in these hedging strategies as well as hedging costs divestitures and tax impacts can further affect the actual impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on citis capital as compared to an unanticipated parallel shock as described above in addition the effect of citis ongoing management strategies

as the change in the value of a position for a defined change in a market risk factor such as a change in the value of a us treasury bond for a onebasis point change in interest rates citis global market risk function within the independent risk management organization works to ensure that factor sensitivities are calculated monitored and limited for all material risks taken in the trading portfolios value at risk var var estimates at a confidence level the potential decline in the value of a position or a portfolio under normal market conditions assuming a oneday holding period var statistics which are based on historical data can be materially different across firms due to differences in portfolio composition differences in var methodologies and differences in model parameters as a result citi believes var statistics can be used more effectively as indicators of trends in risktaking within a firm rather than as a basis for inferring differences in risktaking across firms citi uses a single independently approved monte carlo simulation var model see var model review and validation below which has been designed to capture material risk sensitivities such as first and secondorder sensitivities of positions to changes in market prices of various asset classesrisk types such as interest rate credit spread foreign exchange equity and commodity risks citis var includes positions that are measured at fair value it does not include investment securities classified as afs or htm for information on these securities see note to the consolidated financial statements citi believes its var model is conservatively calibrated to incorporate fattail scaling and the greater of shortterm approximately the most recent month and longterm three years market volatility the monte carlo simulation involves approximately market factors making use of approximately time series with sensitivities updated daily volatility parameters updated intramonthly and correlation parameters updated monthly the conservative features of the var calibration contribute an approximate addon to what would be a var estimated under the assumption of stable and perfectly normally distributed markets as set forth in the table below citis average trading var decreased million from to mainly due to a reduction of market volatility given improved macroeconomic conditions compared to citis

the sum of the vars tied to each risk type the benefit reflects the fact that the risks within individual and across risk types are not perfectly correlated and consequently the total var on a given

lowduring year var model review and validation generally citis var review and model validation process entails reviewing the model framework major assumptions and implementation of the mathematical algorithm in addition product specific backtesting on portfolios is periodically completed as part of the ongoing model performance monitoring process and reviewed with citis us banking regulators furthermore regulatory var back testing as described below is performed against buyand hold profit and loss on a monthly basis for multiple sub portfolios across the organization trading desk level icg business segment and citigroup and the results are shared with us banking regulators material var model and assumption changes must be independently validated within citis independent risk management organization all model changes including those for the var model are validated by the model validation group within citis model risk management in the event of significant model changes parallel model runs are undertaken prior to implementation in addition significant model and assumption changes are subject to the periodic reviews and approval by citis us banking regulators citi uses the same independently validated var model for both regulatory var and risk management var ie total trading and total trading and credit portfolios vars and as such the model review and validation process for both purposes is as described above regulatory var which is calculated in accordance with basel iii differs from risk management var due to the fact that certain positions included in risk management var are not eligible for market risk treatment in regulatory var the composition of risk management var is discussed under value at risk above the applicability of the var model for positions eligible for market risk treatment under us regulatory capital rules is periodically reviewed and approved by citis us banking regulators in accordance with basel iii regulatory var includes all trading bookcovered positions and all foreign exchange and commodity exposures pursuant to basel iii regulatory var excludes positions that fail to meet the intent and ability to trade requirements and are therefore classified as non trading book and categories of exposures that are specifically excluded as covered positions regulatory var excludes cva on derivative instruments and dva on citis own fair value option liabilities cva hedges are excluded from regulatory var and included in credit riskweighted assets as computed under the advanced approaches for determining riskweighted assets regulatory var backtesting in accordance with basel iii citi is required to perform back testing to evaluate the effectiveness of its regulatory var model regulatory var backtesting is the process in which the daily oneday var at a confidence interval is compared to the buyandhold profit and loss ie the profit and loss impact if the portfolio is held constant at the end of the day and repriced the following day buyandhold profit and loss represents the daily marktomarket profit and loss attributable to price movements in covered positions from the close of the previous business day buyandhold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue net interest fees and commissions intraday trading profit and loss and changes in reserves based on a confidence level citi would expect two to three days in any one year where buyandhold losses exceed the regulatory var given the conservative calibration of citis var model as a result of taking the greater of short and longterm volatilities and fattail scaling of volatilities citi would expect fewer exceptions under normal and stable market conditions periods of unstable market conditions could increase the number of backtesting exceptions the following graph shows the daily buyandhold profit and loss associated with citis covered positions compared to citis oneday regulatory var during as of december one backtesting exception was observed at the citigroup level the difference between the of days with buyand hold gains for regulatory var backtesting and the of days with trading net interest and other revenue associated with citis trading businesses shown in the histogram of daily tradingrelated revenue below reflects among other things that a significant portion of citis tradingrelated revenue is not generated from daily price movements on these positions and exposures as well as differences in the portfolio composition of regulatory var and risk management var regulatory trading var and associated buyandhold profit and loss112 months ended december in millions of dollars buyandhold profit and loss as defined by the banking regulators under basel iii represents the daily marktomarket revenue movement attributable to the trading position from the close of the previous business day buyandhold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue and net interest intraday trading profit and loss on new and terminated trades as well as changes in reserves therefore it is not comparable to the tradingrelated revenue presented in the chart of daily tradingrelated revenue above stress testing citi performs market risk stress testing on a regular basis to estimate the impact of extreme market movements it is performed on individual positions and trading portfolios as well as in aggregate inclusive of multiple trading portfolios citis market risk management after consultations with the businesses develops both systemic and specific stress scenarios reviews the output of periodic stress testing exercises and uses the information to assess the ongoing appropriateness of exposure levels and limits citi uses two complementary approaches to market risk stress testing across all major risk factors ie equity foreign exchange commodity interest rate and credit spreads topdown systemic stresses and bottomup businessspecific stresses systemic stresses are designed to quantify the potential impact of extreme market movements on an institutionwide basis and are constructed using both historical periods of market stress and projections of adverse economic scenarios businessspecific stresses are designed to probe the risks of particular portfolios and market segments especially those risks that are not fully captured in var and systemic stresses the systemic stress scenarios and businessspecific stress scenarios at citi are used in several reports reviewed by senior management and also to calculate internal risk capital for trading market risk in general changes in market values are defined over a oneyear horizon for the most liquid positions and market factors changes in market values are defined over a shorter twomonth horizon the limited set of positions and market factors whose market value changes are defined over a twomonth horizon are those that in managements judgment have historically remained very liquid during financial crises even as the trading liquidity of most other positions and market factors materially declined operational risk overview operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes people and systems or from external events this includes legal risk which is the risk of loss including litigation costs settlements and regulatory fines resulting from the failure of citi to comply with laws regulations prudent ethical standards and contractual obligations in any aspect of its businesses but excludes strategic and reputation risks citi also recognizes the impact of operational risk on the reputation risk associated with citis business activities operational risk is inherent in citis global business activities as well as related support functions and can result in losses citi maintains a comprehensive citiwide risk taxonomy to classify operational risks that it faces using standardized definitions across citis operational risk management framework see discussion below this taxonomy also supports regulatory requirements and expectations inclusive of those related to us basel iii comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar heightened standards for large financial institutions and dodd frank annual stress testing dfast citi manages operational risk consistent with the overall framework described in managing global riskoverview above citis goal is to keep operational risk at appropriate levels relative to the characteristics of its businesses the markets in which it operates its capital and liquidity and the competitive economic and regulatory environment this includes effectively managing operational risk and maintaining or reducing operational risk exposures within citis operational risk appetite citis independent operational risk management group has established a globaloperational risk management framework with policies and practices for identification measurement monitoring managing and reporting operational risks and the overall operating effectiveness of the internal control environment as part of this framework citi has defined its operational risk appetite and established a managers control assessment mca process for self identification of significant operational risks assessment of the performance of key controls and mitigation of residual risk above acceptable levels each major business segment must implement operational risk processes consistent with the requirements of this framework this includes understanding the operational risks they are exposed to designing controls to mitigate identified risks establishing key indicators monitoring and reporting whether the operational risk exposures are in or out of their operational risk appetite having processes in place to bring operational risk exposures within acceptable levels periodically estimate and aggregate the operational risks they are exposed to and ensuring that sufficient resources are available to actively improve the operational risk environment and mitigate emerging risks citi considers operational risks that result from the introduction of new or changes to existing products or result from significant changes in its organizational structures systems processes and personnel citi has a governance structure for the oversight of operational risk exposures through business risk and controls committees brccs which include a citigroup brcc as well as business functions regional and country brccs brccs are chaired by the individuals in the first line of defense and provide escalation channels for senior management to review operational risk exposures including breaches of operational risk appetite key indicators operational risk events and control issues membership includes senior business and functions leadership as well as members of the second line of defense in addition independent risk management including the operational risk management group works proactively with citis businesses and functions to drive a strong and embedded operational risk management culture and framework across citi the operational risk management group actively challenges business and functions implementation of the operational risk management framework requirements and the quality of operational risk management practices and outcomes information about businesses key operational risks

techniques and procedures and use of new technologies to conduct financial transactions citi and its clients customers and third parties are and will continue to be at risk from cyber attacks and information security incidents citi recognizes the significance of these risks and therefore leverages an intelligenceled strategy to protect against detect and respond to and recover from cyber attacks further citi actively participates in financial industry government and crosssector knowledgesharing groups to enhance individual and collective cybersecurity preparedness and resilience risk management citis technology and cybersecurity risk management program is built on three lines of defense citis first line of defense under the office of the chief information security officer provides frontline business operational and technical controls and capabilities to protect against cybersecurity risks and to respond to cyber incidents and data breaches citi manages these threats through stateoftheart fusion centers which serve as central commands for monitoring and coordinating responses to cyber threats the enterprise information security team is responsible for infrastructure defense and security controls performing vulnerability assessments and thirdparty information security assessments employee awareness and training programs and security incident management in each case the team works in coordination with a network of information security officers who are embedded within the businesses and functions globally citis operational risk managementtechnology and cyber ormtc and independent compliance risk managementtechnology and information security icrmt groups serve as the second line of defense and actively evaluate anticipate and challenge citis risk mitigation practices and capabilities citi seeks to proactively identify and remediate technology and cybersecurity risks before they materialize as incidents that negatively affect business operations accordingly the ormtc team independently challenges and monitors capabilities in accordance with citis defined technology and cyber risk appetite statements to address evolving cybersecurity risks and corresponding regulations ormtc and icrmt teams collectively also monitor cyber legal and regulatory requirements identify and define emerging risks execute strategic cyber threat assessments perform new products and initiative reviews perform data management risk oversight and conduct cyber risk assurance reviews inclusive of thirdparty assessments in addition ormtc employs tools and oversees and challenges metrics that are both tailored to cybersecurity and technology and aligned with citis overall operational risk management framework to effectively track identify and manage risk internal audit serves as the third line of defense and independently provides assurance on how effectively the organization as a whole manages cybersecurity risk citi also has multiple senior committees such as the information security risk committee isrc which governs enterprise level risk tolerance inclusive of cybersecurity risk board oversight citis board of directors provides oversight of managements efforts to mitigate cybersecurity risk and respond to cyber incidents the board receives regular reports on cybersecurity and engages in discussions throughout the year with management and subjectmatter experts on the effectiveness of citis overall cybersecurity program the board also obtains updates on citis inherent cybersecurity risks and citis road map and progress for addressing these risks moreover citis board and its committee members receive contemporaneous reporting on significant cyber events including response legal obligations and outreach and notification to regulators and customers when needed as well as guidance to management as appropriate in the board of directors underwent a cyber incident tabletop exercise also in the boards risk management committee approved a standalone cybersecurity risk appetite statement against which citis performance is measured quarterly for additional information on the boards oversight of cybersecurity risk management see citis proxy statement to be filed with the sec in march compliance risk compliance risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from violations of laws rules or regulations or from nonconformance with prescribed practices internal policies and procedures or ethical standards compliance risk exposes citi to fines civil money penalties payment of damages and the voiding of contracts compliance risk can result in diminished reputation harm to citis customers limited business opportunities and lessened expansion potential it encompasses the risk of noncompliance with all laws and regulations as well as prudent ethical standards and some contractual obligations it could also include exposure to litigation known as legal risk from all aspects of traditional and nontraditional banking citi seeks to operate with integrity maintain strong ethical standards and adhere to applicable policies and regulatory and legal requirements citi must maintain and execute a proactive compliance risk management crm policy that is designed to manage compliance risk effectively across citi with a view to fundamentally strengthen the compliance risk management culture across the lines of defense taking into account citis risk governance framework and regulatory requirements independent compliance risk managements icrm primary objectives are to drive and embed a culture of compliance and control throughout citi maintain and oversee an integrated crm policy and compliance risk framework that facilitates enterprise wide compliance with local national or crossborder laws rules or regulations citis internal policies standards and procedures and relevant standards of conduct assess compliance risks and issues across product lines functions and geographies supported by globally consistent systems and compliance risk management processes and provide compliance risk data aggregation and reporting capabilities to anticipate control and mitigate compliance risk citi has established the crm policy to achieve standardization and centralization of methodologies and processes and to enable more consistent and comprehensive execution of compliance risk management citi has a commitment as well as an obligation to identify assess and mitigate compliance risks associated with its businesses and functions icrm is responsible for oversight of citis crm policy while all businesses and global control functions are responsible for managing their compliance risks and operating within the compliance risk appetite citi carries out its objectives and fulfills its responsibilities through the compliance risk framework which is composed of the following integrated key activities to holistically manage compliance risk management of citis compliance with laws rules and regulations by identifying and analyzing changes assessing the impact and implementing appropriate policies processes and controls developing and providing compliance training to ensure colleagues are aware of and understand the key laws rules and regulations monitoring the compliance risk appetite which is articulated through qualitative compliance risk statements describing citis appetite for certain types of risk and quantitative measures to monitor the companys compliance risk exposure monitoring and testing of compliance risks and controls in assessing conformance with laws rules regulations and internal policies and issue identification escalation and remediation to drive accountability including measurement and reporting of compliance risk metrics against established thresholds in support of the crm policy and compliance risk appetite as discussed above citi is working to address the frb and occ consent orders which include improvements to citis compliance risk framework and its enterprisewide application for additional information regarding the consent orders see citis consent order compliance above reputation risk citis reputation is a vital asset in building trust with its stakeholders and citi is diligent in enhancing and protecting its reputation with its colleagues customers investors and regulators to support this citi has developed a reputation risk framework under this framework citigroup and citibank have implemented a risk appetite statement and related key indicators to monitor corporate activities and operations relative to our risk appetite the framework also requires that business segments and regions escalate significant reputation risks that require review or mitigation through a reputation risk committee or equivalent the reputation risk committees which are composed of citis most senior executives govern the process by which material reputation risks are identified monitored reported managed and escalated the reputation risk committees determine the appropriate actions to be taken in line with risk appetite and regulatory expectations while promoting a culture of risk awareness and high standards of integrity and ethical behavior across the company consistent with citis mission and value proposition the reputation risk committees in the business segments and regions are part of the governance infrastructure that citi has in place to review the reputation risk posed by business activities sales practices product design or perceived conflicts of interest these committees may also raise potential reputation risks for due consideration by the reputation risk committee at the corporate level the citigroup reputation risk committee may escalate reputation risks to the nomination governance and public affairs committee or other appropriate committee of the citigroup board of directors the responsibility for enhancing and protecting citis reputation is shared by all colleagues who are guided by citis code of conduct colleagues are expected to exercise sound judgment and common sense in decisions and actions they are also expected to promptly escalate all issues that present potential reputation risk in line with policy strategic risk as discussed above strategic risk is the risk of a sustained impact not episodic impact to citis core strategic objectives as measured by impacts on anticipated earnings market capitalization or capital arising from the external factors affecting the companys operating environment as well as the risks associated with defining the strategy and executing the strategy which are identified measured and managed as part of the strategic risk framework at the enterprise level in this context external factors affecting citis operating environment are the economic environment geopolitical political landscape industrycompetitive landscape societal trends customerclient behavior regulatorylegislative environment and trends related to investorsshareholders citis executive management team is responsible for the development and execution of citis strategy this strategy is translated into forwardlooking plans collectively citis strategic plan that are then cascaded across the organization citis strategic plan is presented to the board on an annual basis and is aligned with risk appetite thresholds and includes top risk identification as required by internal frameworks it is also aligned with limit requirements for capital allocation governance and oversight of strategic risk is facilitated by internal committees on a groupwide basis as well as strategic committees at the icg gcb and regional levels citi works to ensure that strategic risks are adequately considered and addressed across its various risk management activities and that strategic risks are assessed in the context of citis risk appetite citi conducts a topdown bottomup risk identification process to identify risks including strategic risks business segments undertake a quarterly risk identification process to systematically identify and document all material risks faced by citi independent risk management oversees the risk identification process through regular reviews and coordinates identification and monitoring of top risks independent risk management also manages strategic risk by monitoring risk appetite thresholds in conjunction with various strategic risk committees which are part of the governance structure that citi has in place to manage its strategic risks for additional

libor on a representative basis on december with plans to cease publication of all other usd libor tenors on june regulators expect banks including citi to have ceased entering into new contracts that reference usd libor as a benchmark by december except for limited circumstances as set out in regulatory guidance citi recognizes that a transition away from and discontinuance of libor presents various risks and challenges that could significantly impact financial markets and market participants including citi for information about citis risks from a transition away from and discontinuation of libor or any other benchmark rates see risk factors other risks above accordingly citi has continued its efforts to identify and manage its libor transition risks for example citi continues to closely monitor legislative regulatory and other developments related to libor transition matters and legislative relief the international swaps and derivatives association isda published the interbank offered rate ibor fallbacks protocol for existing ibor derivatives transactions which became effective in january the ibor fallbacks protocol provides derivatives market participants with new fallbacks for legacy and new derivatives contracts if both counterparties adhere to the protocol or engage in bilateral amendments see discussion below regarding citis adherence to the protocol in april legislation was adopted in new york state that provides for the use of a statutory replacement for usd libor in certain new york law legacy contracts similar federal legislation was passed in the house of representatives in december and is pending passage by the senate although there is no guarantee that the federal legislative proposal will become law in addition citi has established a libor governance and implementation program focused on identifying and addressing the impact of libor transition on citis clients operational capabilities and financial contracts the program operates globally across citis businesses and functions and includes active involvement of senior management oversight by citis asset and liability committee and reporting to the risk management committee of citigroups board of directors as part of the program citi has continued to implement its libor transition action plans and associated roadmaps under the following key workstreams program management transition strategy and risk management customer management including internal communications and training legalcontract management and product management financial exposures and risk management regulatory and industry engagement operations and technology and finance risk tax and treasury during citi continued to participate in a number of working groups formed by global regulators including the alternative reference rates committee arrc convened by the frb these working groups promote and advance development of alternative reference rates and seek to identify and address potential challenges from any transition to such rates citis libor transition action plans and associated roadmaps are intended to be consistent with the timelines recommended by these working groups this includes the commodity futures trading commissions sofr first initiative which is designed to promote derivatives trading in sofr citi also continued to engage with regulators financial accounting bodies and others on libor transition matters citis libor transition efforts include among other things reducing its overall exposure to libor increasing citis virtual client communication efforts and client transition facilitation including outreach regarding new industryled protocols and solutions and using alternative reference rates in certain newly issued financial instruments and products in the past several years citi has issued preferred stock and benchmark debt referencing the secured overnight financing rate sofr and issued customerrelated debt referencing sofr and the sterling overnight interbank average rate sonia the recommended replacement rate for sterling libor citi has also originated and arranged loans referencing sofr and sonia and executed sofr and soniabased derivatives contracts further citi has also been investing in its systems and infrastructure as client activity moves away from libor to alternative reference rates since the arrcs recommendation of cme groups term sofr in july citi has focused on systems readiness to provide term sofr loan and derivatives to clients where permitted in citi also focused on remediating existing libor contracts for which publication ceased on a representative basis on december substantially all of these contracts were remediated by december and citi continues to actively engage in and track the remediation of any remaining contracts after december as of december citis overall usd libor gross notional exposure for contracts maturing after the libor cessation date of june was approximately trillion which includes approximately trillion of cleared derivatives that are covered by planned central counterparty clearing house ccp conversions and approximately trillion of bilateral derivatives that are covered by robust contract fallback language the remaining exposure of approximately trillion includes bilateral derivatives and cash products that will be addressed by contract remediation plans in addition for libor contracts that have not yet been remediated citi continues to review the effect of relevant legislative solutions which are expected to facilitate the transition to replacement rates climate risk climate change presents immediate and longterm risks to citi and its clients and customers with the risks expected to increase over time climate risk refers to the risk of loss arising from climate change and is comprised of both physical risk and transition risk physical risk considers how chronic and acute climate change eg increased storms drought fires floods can directly damage physical assets eg real estate crops or otherwise impact their value or productivity transition risk considers how changes in policy technology business practices and market preferences to address climate change eg carbon pricing policies power generation shifts from fossil fuels to renewable energy can lead to changes in the value of assets commodities and companies climate risk is an overarching risk that can act as a driver of other categories of risk such as credit risk from obligors exposed to high climate risk reputational risk from increased stakeholder concerns about financing highcarbon industries and operational risk from physical risks to citis facilities and personnel citi currently identifies climate risk as an emerging risk within its enterprise risk management framework emerging risks are risks or thematic issues that are either new to the landscape or in the case of climate risk existing risks that are rapidly changing or evolving in an escalating fashion which are difficult to assess due to limited data or other uncertainties for additional information on climate risk see risk factors other risks above citi reviews factors related to climate risk under its longstanding environmental and social risk management esrm policy which includes a focus on climate risk related to financed projects and clients in highcarbon sectors cautious of the credit risk of stranded assets as well as the reputational risks associated with the coal sector due to its high carbon emissions citi began a phasedown of its financing of thermal coal mining companies in and of new coalfired power plants in as citis phasedown has continued citis esrm policy was updated to include a prohibition on all projectrelated financing of new coalfired power plants and new or expanding thermal coal mines as well as clear timetables to reduce financing of companies with high exposure to coal fired power and coal mining who do not pursue lowcarbon transition in the coming years these sector approaches allow citi to set a comprehensive and industry wide approach to clarify its positions set clear expectations for its clients and help address certain climate risk driven credit risk concerns while reducing reputation risk citi continues to explore and test methodologies for quantifying how climate risks could impact the individual credit profiles of its clients across various sectors to assist in embedding climate risk assessments in its credit assessment process citi is developing sectorspecific climate risk assessments such climate risk assessments are designed to supplement publicly available client disclosures and data provided from thirdparty vendors and facilitate conversations with clients on their most material climate risks and management plans for adaptation and mitigation in the near term citis assessments will consider sectors that have been identified as higher climate risk by citis risk identification process this will not only help citi better understand its clients businesses and climaterelated risks but will also provide a source of climate data citis net zero plan is leading to the further integration of climate risk discussions into client engagement and client selection furthermore citi is developing globally consistent principles and approaches for managing climate risk across citi climate risk will be embedded into relevant policies and processes over time in addition citi continues to participate in financial industry collaborations to develop and pilot new methodologies and approaches for measuring and assessing the potential financial risks of climate change citi is also closely monitoring regulatory developments on climate risk and sustainable finance and actively engaging with regulators on these topics for additional information about sustainability and other esg matters at citi see sustainability and other esg matters above country risk top

all of citis domestic operations in russia are conducted through a subsidiary of citibank which uses the russian ruble as its functional currency citis net investment in russia was approximately billion as of december the majority of citis net investment was hedged for foreign currency depreciation as of december using forward foreign exchange contracts citis total thirdparty exposure was approximately billion as of december these assets primarily consisted of corporate and consumer loans local government debt securities reverse repurchase agreements and cash on deposit and placements with the bank of russia and other financial institutions a significant portion of citis thirdparty exposures were funded with domestic deposit liabilities from both icg and gcb clients further citi has approximately billion of additional exposures to russian counterparties that are not held on the russian subsidiary and are not included in the billion above the billion in russia credit and other

appropriate for additional information see risk factorsmarketrelated risk operational risks and other risks above located in that country argentina citi operates in argentina through its icg businesses as of december citis net investment in its argentine operations was approximately billion citi uses the us dollar as the functional currency for its operations in highly inflationary countries under us gaap citi uses argentinas official market exchange rate to remeasure its net argentine pesodenominated assets into the us dollar as of december the official argentine peso exchange rate against the us dollar was the central bank of argentina maintains certain capital and currency controls that generally restrict citis ability to access us dollars in argentina and remit substantially all of its earnings from its argentine operations citis net investment in its argentine operations is likely to increase as citi continues to generate net income from its argentine franchise and the majority of its earnings cannot be remitted due to the currency controls implemented by the central bank of argentina certain indirect foreign exchange mechanisms have developed that some argentine entities may use to obtain us dollars generally at rates that are significantly higher than argentinas official exchange rate citibank argentina is precluded from accessing these alternative mechanisms and these exchange mechanisms cannot be used to remeasure citis net monetary assets into the us dollar under us gaap citi cannot predict future fluctuations in argentinas official market exchange rate or to what extent citi may be able to access us dollars at the official exchange rate in the future citi economically hedges the foreign currency risk in its net argentine pesodenominated assets to the extent possible and prudent using nondeliverable forward ndf derivative instruments that are primarily executed outside of argentina as of december the international ndf market had very limited liquidity resulting in citi being unable to economically hedge nearly all of its argentine peso exposure as a result and to the extent that citi does not execute ndf contracts for this unhedged exposure in the future citi would record devaluations on its net argentine pesodenominated assets in earnings without any benefit from a change in the fair value of derivative positions used to economically hedge the exposure citi continually evaluates its economic exposure to its argentine counterparties and reserves for changes in credit risk and sovereign risk associated with its argentine assets citi believes it has established appropriate allowances for credit losses on its argentine loans and appropriate fair value adjustments on argentine assets and liabilities measured at fair value for such risks under us gaap as of december however us regulatory agencies may require citi to record additional reserves in the future increasing icgs cost of credit based on the perceived country risk associated with its argentine exposures ffieccrossborder claims on third parties and local country assets citis crossborder disclosures are set forth below based on the country exposure bank regulatory reporting guidelines of the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec the following summarizes some of the ffiec key reporting guidelines amounts are based on the domicile of the ultimate obligor counterparty collateral only including qualifying liquid collateral issuer or guarantor as applicable eg a security recorded by a citi us entity but issued by the uk government is considered uk exposure a loan recorded by a citi mexico entity to a customer domiciled in mexico where the underlying collateral is held in germany is considered german exposure amounts do not consider the benefit of collateral received for secured financing transactions ie repurchase agreements reverse repurchase agreements and securities loaned and borrowed and are reported based on notional amounts netting of derivative receivables and payables reported at fair value is permitted but only under a legally binding netting agreement with the same specific counterparty and does not include the benefit of margin received or hedges credit default swaps cds are included based on the gross notional amount sold and purchased and do not include any offsetting cds on the same underlying entity loans are reported without the benefit of hedges given the requirements noted above citis ffiec cross border exposures and total outstandings tend to fluctuate in some cases significantly from period to period as an example because total outstandings under ffiec guidelines do not include the benefit of margin or hedges market volatility in interest

to efficiently fund a portion of citis trading inventory transactions executed by citis bank subsidiaries primarily facilitate customer financing activity to maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market conditions including under periods of stress citi manages these activities by taking into consideration the quality of the underlying collateral and stipulating financing tenor citi manages the risks in its collateralized financing transactions by conducting daily stress tests to account for changes in capacity tenors haircut collateral profile and client actions in addition citi maintains counterparty diversification by establishing concentration triggers and assessing counterparty reliability and stability under stress it is the companys policy to take possession of the underlying collateral monitor its market value relative to the amounts due under the agreements and when necessary require prompt transfer of additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection for resale and repurchase agreements when necessary the company posts additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection collateral typically consists of government and governmentagency securities corporate and municipal bonds equities and mortgage and other assetbacked securities the resale and repurchase agreements are generally documented under industry standard agreements that allow the prompt closeout of all transactions including the liquidation of securities held and the offsetting of obligations to return cash or securities by the nondefaulting party following a payment default or other type of default under the relevant master agreement events of default generally include i failure to deliver cash or securities as required under the transaction ii failure to provide or return cash or securities as used for margining purposes iii breach of representation iv crossdefault to another transaction entered into among the

above a substantial portion of securities borrowing and lending agreements is recorded at the amount of cash advanced or received the remaining portion is recorded at fair value as the company elected the fair value option for certain securities borrowed and loaned portfolios as described in note to the consolidated financial statements with respect to securities loaned the company receives cash collateral in an amount generally in excess of the market value of the securities loaned the company monitors the market value of securities borrowed and securities loaned on a daily basis and obtains or posts additional collateral in order to maintain contractual margin protection the enforceability of offsetting rights incorporated in the master netting agreements for resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending agreements is evidenced to the extent that i a supportive legal opinion has been obtained from counsel of recognized standing that provides the requisite level of certainty regarding the enforceability of these agreements and ii the exercise of rights by the nondefaulting party to terminate and close out transactions on a net basis under these agreements will not be stayed or avoided under applicable law upon an event of default including bankruptcy insolvency or similar proceeding a legal opinion may not have been sought or obtained for certain jurisdictions where local law is silent or sufficiently ambiguous to determine the enforceability of offsetting rights or where adverse case law or conflicting regulation may cast doubt on the enforceability of such rights in some jurisdictions and for some counterparty types the insolvency law for a particular counterparty type may be nonexistent or unclear as overlapping regimes may exist for example this may be the case for certain sovereigns municipalities central banks and us pension plans the following tables present the gross and net resale and repurchase agreements and

securities held by the company as of december and evaluating investments for impairment afs debt securities overviewafs debt securities the company conducts periodic reviews of all afs debt securities with unrealized losses to evaluate whether the impairment resulted from expected credit losses or from other factors and to evaluate the companys intent to sell such securities an afs debt security is impaired when the current fair value of an individual afs debt security is less than its amortized cost basis the company recognizes the entire difference between amortized cost basis and fair value in earnings for impaired afs debt securities that citi has an intent to sell or for which citi believes it will morelikelythannot be required to sell prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis however for those afs debt securities that the company does not intend to sell and is not likely to be required to sell only the credit related impairment is recognized in earnings by recording an allowance for credit losses any remaining fair value decline for such securities is recorded in aoci the company does not consider the length of time that the fair value of a security is below its amortized cost when determining if a credit loss exists for afs debt securities credit losses exist where citi does not expect to receive contractual principal and interest cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of a security the allowance for credit losses is limited to the amount by which the afs debt securitys amortized cost basis exceeds its fair value the allowance is increased or decreased if credit conditions subsequently worsen or improve reversals of credit losses are recognized in earnings the companys review for impairment of afs debt securities generally entails identification and evaluation of impaired investments consideration of evidential matter including an evaluation of factors or triggers that could cause individual positions to qualify as credit impaired and those that would not support credit impairment and documentation of the results of these analyses as required under business policies the sections below describe the companys process for identifying expected credit impairments for debt security types that have the most significant unrealized losses as of december mortgagebacked securities citi records no allowances for credit losses on us governmentagencyguaranteed mortgagebacked securities because the company expects to incur no credit losses in the event of default due to a history of incurring no credit losses and due to the nature of the counterparties state and municipal securities the process for estimating credit losses in citigroups afs state and municipal bonds is primarily based on a credit analysis that incorporates thirdparty credit ratings citi monitors the bond issuers and any insurers providing default protection in the form of financial guarantee insurance the average external credit rating disregarding any insurance is aa2aa in the event of an external rating downgrade or other indicator of credit impairment ie based on instrument specific estimates of cash flows or probability of issuer default the subject bond is specifically reviewed for adverse changes in the amount or timing of expected contractual principal and interest payments for afs state and municipal bonds with unrealized losses that citi plans to sell or would morelikelythannot be required to sell the full impairment is recognized in earnings for afs state and municipal bonds where citi has no intent to sell and it is morelikelythannot that the company will not be required to sell citi records an allowance for expected credit losses for the amount it expects not to collect capped at the difference between the bonds amortized cost basis and fair value equity method investments management assesses equity method investments that have fair values that are less than their respective carrying values for otherthantemporary impairment otti fair value is measured as price multiplied by quantity if the investee has publicly listed securities if the investee is not publicly listed other methods are used see note to the consolidated financial statements for impaired equity method investments that citi plans to sell prior to recovery of value or would morelikelythannot be required to sell with no expectation that the fair value will recover prior to the expected sale date the full impairment is recognized as otti in other revenue regardless of severity and duration the measurement of the otti does not include partial projected recoveries subsequent to the balance sheet date for impaired equity method investments that management does not plan to sell and is not morelikelythannot to be required to sell prior to recovery of value the evaluation of whether an impairment is otherthantemporary is based on i whether and when an equity method investment will recover in value and ii whether the investor has the intent and ability to hold that investment for a period of time sufficient to recover the value the determination of whether the impairment is considered otherthantemporary considers the following indicators the cause of the impairment and the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer including any specific events that may influence the operations of the issuer the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value and the length of time and extent to which

interest entities uses of special purpose entities a special purpose entity spe is an entity designed to fulfill a specific limited need of the company that organized it the principal uses of spes by citi are to assist clients in securitizing their financial assets and to create investment products for clients and to obtain liquidity and optimize capital efficiency by securitizing certain of citis financial assets spes may be organized in various legal forms including trusts partnerships or corporations in a securitization through the spes issuance of debt and equity instruments certificates commercial paper or other notes of indebtedness the company transferring assets to the spe converts all or a portion of those assets into cash before they would have been realized in the normal course of business these issuances are recorded on the balance sheet of the spe which may or may not be consolidated onto the balance sheet of the company that organized the spe investors usually have recourse only to the assets in the spe but may also benefit from other credit enhancements such as a collateral account a line of credit or a liquidity facility such as a liquidity put option or asset purchase agreement because of these enhancements the spe issuances typically obtain a more favorable credit rating than the transferor could obtain for its own debt issuances this results in less expensive financing costs than unsecured debt the spe may also enter into derivative contracts in order to convert the yield or currency of the underlying assets to match the needs of the spe investors or to limit or change the credit risk of the spe citigroup may be the provider of certain credit enhancements as well as the counterparty to any related derivative contracts most of citigroups spes are variable interest entities vies variable interest entities vies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements investors that finance the vie through debt or equity interests or other counterparties providing other forms of support such as guarantees certain fee arrangements or certain types of derivative contracts are variable interest holders in the entity the variable interest holder if any that has a controlling financial interest in a vie is deemed to be the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie the company must evaluate each vie to understand the purpose and design of the entity the role the company had in the entitys design and its involvement in the vies ongoing activities the company then must evaluate which activities most significantly impact the economic performance of the vie and who has the power to direct such activities for those vies where the company determines that it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vies economic performance the company must then evaluate its economic interests if any and determine whether it could absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie when evaluating whether the company has an obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant it considers the maximum exposure to such loss without consideration of probability such obligations could be in various forms including but not limited to debt and equity investments guarantees liquidity agreements and certain derivative contracts in various other transactions the company may i act as a derivative counterparty eg interest rate swap cross currency swap or purchaser of credit protection under a credit default swap or total return swap where the company pays the total return on certain assets to the spe ii act as underwriter or placement agent iii provide administrative trustee or other services or iv make a market in debt securities or other instruments issued by vies the company generally considers such involvement by itself not to be variable interests and thus not an indicator of power or potentially

securitizations in which the original mortgage loan balances are no longer outstanding and vies such as trust preferred securities trusts used in connection with the companys funding activities the company does not have a variable interest in these trusts the asset balances for consolidated vies represent the carrying amounts of the assets consolidated by the company the carrying amount may represent the amortized cost or the current fair value of the assets depending on the classification of the asset eg loan or security and the associated accounting model ascribed to that classification the asset balances for unconsolidated vies in which the company has significant involvement represent the most current information available to the company in most cases the asset balances represent an amortized cost basis without regard to impairments unless fair value information is readily available to the company the maximum funded exposure represents the balance sheet carrying amount of the companys investment in the vie it reflects the initial amount of cash invested in the vie adjusted for any accrued interest and cash principal payments received the carrying amount may also be adjusted for increases or declines in fair value or any impairment in value recognized in earnings the maximum exposure of unfunded positions represents the remaining undrawn committed amount including liquidity and credit facilities provided by the company or the notional amount of a derivative instrument considered to be a variable interest in certain transactions the company has entered into derivative instruments or other arrangements that are not considered variable interests in the vie eg interest rate swaps cross currency swaps or where the company is the

assets of the respective vies and do not have such recourse to the company except where citi has provided a guarantee to the investors or is the counterparty to certain derivative transactions

financing intercompany assets and liabilities are excluded from citis consolidated balance sheet all vie assets are restricted from being sold or pledged as collateral the cash flows from these assets

a sellers interest and certain securities issued by the trusts which could result in exposure to potentially significant losses or benefits from the trusts accordingly the transferred credit card receivables remain on citis consolidated balance sheet with no gain or loss recognized the debt issued by the trusts to third parties is included on citis consolidated balance sheet citi utilizes

the company often securitizes these loans through the use of vies these vies are funded through the issuance of trust certificates backed solely by the transferred assets these certificates have the same life as the transferred assets in addition to providing a source of liquidity and less expensive funding securitizing these assets also reduces citis credit exposure to the borrowers these mortgage loan securitizations are primarily nonrecourse thereby effectively transferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchasers of the securities issued by the trust citis us consumer

securitization trusts are classified as trading account assets except for msrs which are included in other assets on citigroups consolidated balance sheet citigroup does not consolidate certain nonagency sponsored mortgage securitization entities because citi is either not the servicer with the power to direct the significant activities of the entity or citi is the servicer but the servicing relationship is deemed to be a fiduciary relationship therefore citi is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the entity in certain instances the company has i the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities economic performance and ii the obligation to either absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to its

securitized assets residential mortgages1 commercial and other total securitized assets include billion of personal loan securitizations as of december mortgage servicing rights msrs in connection with the securitization of mortgage loans citis us consumer mortgage business generally retains the servicing rights which entitle the company to a future stream of cash flows based on the outstanding principal balances of the loans and the contractual servicing fee failure to service the loans in accordance with contractual requirements may lead to a termination of the servicing rights and the loss of future servicing fees these transactions create intangible assets referred to as msrs which are recorded at fair value on citis consolidated balance sheet the fair value of citis capitalized

changes in capitalized msrs in millions of dollars balance beginning of year originations changes in fair value of msrs due to changes in inputs and assumptions other changes1 sales of msrs balance as of december represents changes due to customer payments and passage of time the fair value of the msrs is primarily affected by changes in prepayments of mortgages that result from shifts in mortgage interest rates specifically higher interest rates tend to lead to declining prepayments which causes the fair value of the msrs to increase in managing this risk citigroup economically hedges a significant portion of the value of its msrs through the use of interest rate derivative contracts forward purchase and sale commitments of mortgagebacked securities and purchased securities all classified as trading account assets the company receives fees during the course of servicing previously securitized mortgages the amounts of these fees were as follows in millions of dollars servicing fees late fees ancillary fees total msr fees in the consolidated statement of income these fees are primarily classified as commissions and fees and changes in msr fair values are classified as other revenue resecuritizations the company engages in resecuritization transactions in which debt securities are transferred to a vie in exchange for new beneficial interests citi did not transfer nonagency private label securities to resecuritization entities during the years ended december and these securities are backed by either residential or commercial mortgages and are often structured on behalf of clients as of december and december citi held no retained interests in private label resecuritization transactions structured by citi the company also resecuritizes us government agencyguaranteed mortgagebacked agency securities during the years ended december and citi transferred agency securities with a fair value of approximately billion and billion respectively to

original fair values of agency resecuritization transactions in which citi holds a retained interest as of december and were approximately billion and billion respectively as of december and the company did not consolidate any private label or agency resecuritization entities citiadministered assetbacked commercial paper conduits the company is active in the assetbacked commercial paper conduit business as administrator of several multiseller commercial paper conduits and also as a service provider to singleseller and other commercial paper conduits sponsored by third parties citis multiseller commercial paper conduits are designed to provide the companys clients access to lowcost funding in the commercial paper markets the conduits purchase assets from or provide financing facilities to clients and are funded by issuing commercial paper to thirdparty investors the conduits generally do not purchase assets originated by citi the funding of the conduits is facilitated by the liquidity support and credit enhancements provided by the company as administrator to citis conduits the company is generally responsible for selecting and structuring assets purchased or financed by the conduits making decisions regarding the funding of the conduits including determining the tenor and other features of the commercial paper issued monitoring the quality and performance of the conduits assets and facilitating the operations and cash flows of the conduits in return the company earns structuring fees from customers for individual transactions and earns an administration fee from the conduit which is equal to the income from the client program and liquidity fees of the conduit after payment of conduit expenses this administration fee is fairly stable since most risks and rewards of the underlying assets are passed back to the clients once the asset pricing is negotiated most ongoing income costs and fees are relatively stable as a percentage of the conduits size the conduits administered by citi do not generally invest in liquid securities that are formally rated by third parties the assets are privately negotiated and structured transactions that are generally designed to be held by the conduit rather than actively traded and sold the yield earned by the conduit on each asset is generally tied to the rate on the commercial paper issued by the conduit thus passing interest rate risk to the client each asset purchased by the conduit is structured with transactionspecific credit enhancement features provided by the thirdparty client seller including overcollateralization cash and excess spread collateral accounts direct recourse or thirdparty guarantees these credit enhancements are sized with the objective of approximating a credit rating of a or above based on citis internal risk ratings at december and the commercial paper conduits administered by citi had approximately billion and billion of purchased assets outstanding respectively and had incremental funding commitments with clients of approximately billion and billion respectively substantially all of the funding of the conduits is in the form of shortterm commercial paper at december and the weighted average remaining lives of the commercial paper issued by the conduits were approximately and days respectively the primary credit enhancement provided to the conduit investors is in the form of transactionspecific credit enhancements described above each asset purchased by the conduit is structured with transactionspecific credit enhancement features provided by the thirdparty client seller including overcollateralization cash and excess spread collateral accounts direct recourse or thirdparty guarantees these credit enhancements are sized with the objective of approximating a credit rating of a or above based on citis internal risk ratings in addition to the transactionspecific credit enhancements the conduits other than the government guaranteed loan conduit have obtained letters of credit from the company which equal at least to of the conduits assets with a minimum of million the letters of credit provided by the company to the conduits total approximately billion as of december and billion as of december the net result across multiseller conduits administered by the company is that in the event that defaulted assets exceed the transactionspecific credit enhancements described above any losses in each conduit are allocated first to the company and then to the commercial paper investors citigroup also provides the conduits with two forms of liquidity agreements that are used to provide funding to the conduits in the event of a market disruption among other events each asset of the conduits is supported by a transactionspecific liquidity facility in the form of an asset purchase agreement apa under the apa the company has generally agreed to purchase nondefaulted eligible receivables from the conduit at par the apa is not designed to provide credit support to the conduit as it generally does not permit the purchase of defaulted or impaired assets any funding under the apa will likely subject the underlying conduit clients to increased interest costs in addition the company provides the conduits with programwide liquidity in the form of shortterm lending commitments under these commitments the company has agreed to lend to the conduits in the event of a shortterm disruption in the commercial paper market subject to specified conditions the company receives fees for providing both types of liquidity agreements and considers these fees to be on fair market terms finally citi is one of several named dealers in the commercial paper issued by the conduits and earns a market based fee for providing such services along with thirdparty dealers the company makes a market in the commercial paper and may from time to time fund commercial paper pending sale to a third party on specific dates with less liquidity in the market the company may hold in inventory commercial paper issued by conduits administered by the company as well as conduits administered by third parties separately in the normal course of business citi purchases commercial paper including commercial paper issued by citigroups conduits at december and the company owned billion and billion respectively of the commercial paper issued by its administered conduits the companys investments were not driven by market illiquidity and the company is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the conduits the assetbacked commercial paper conduits are consolidated by citi the company has determined that through its roles as administrator and liquidity provider it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities economic performance these powers include its ability to structure and approve the assets purchased by the conduits its ongoing surveillance and credit mitigation activities its ability to sell or repurchase assets out of the conduits and its liability management in addition as a result of all the companys involvement described above it was concluded that citi has an economic interest that could potentially be significant however the assets and liabilities of the conduits are separate and apart from those of citigroup no assets of any conduit are available to satisfy the creditors of citigroup or any of its other subsidiaries collateralized loan obligations clos a collateralized loan obligation clo is a vie that purchases a portfolio of assets consisting primarily of noninvestment grade corporate loans clos issue multiple tranches of debt and equity to investors to fund the asset purchases and pay upfront expenses associated with forming the clo a third party asset manager is contracted by the clo to purchase the underlying assets from the open market and monitor the credit risk associated with those assets over the term of a clo the asset manager directs purchases and sales of assets in a manner consistent with the clos asset management agreement and indenture in general the clo asset manager will have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the economic performance of the clo investors in a clo through their ownership of debt andor equity in it can also direct certain activities of the clo including removing its asset manager under limited circumstances optionally redeeming the notes voting on amendments to the clos operating documents and other activities a clo has a finite life typically years citi serves as a structuring and placement agent with respect to the clos typically the debt and equity of the clos are sold to thirdparty investors on occasion certain citi entities may purchase some portion of a clos liabilities for investment purposes in addition citi may purchase typically in the secondary market certain securities issued by the clos to support its marketmaking activities the company generally does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the clos as this power is generally held by a thirdparty asset manager of the clo as such those clos are not consolidated the following tables summarize selected cash flow information and retained interests related to

securities issued by state and local governments and municipalities tob trusts are typically structured as singleissuer entities whose assets are purchased from either the company or from other investors in the municipal securities market tob trusts finance the purchase of their municipal assets by issuing two classes of certificates long dated floating rate certificates floaters that are putable pursuant to a liquidity facility and residual interest certificates residuals the floaters are purchased by thirdparty investors typically taxexempt money market funds the residuals are purchased by the original owner of the municipal securities that are being financed from citigroups perspective there are two types of tob trusts customer and noncustomer customer tob trusts are those trusts utilized by customers of the company to finance their securities generally municipal securities the residuals issued by these trusts are purchased by the customer being financed noncustomer tob trusts are generally used by the company to finance its own municipal securities investments the residuals issued by noncustomer tob trusts are purchased by the company with respect to both customer and noncustomer tob trusts citi may provide remarketing agent services if floaters are optionally tendered and the company in its role as remarketing agent is unable to find a new investor to purchase the optionally tendered floaters within a specified period of time citigroup may but is not obligated to purchase the tendered floaters into its own inventory the level of the companys inventory of such floaters fluctuates for certain customer tob trusts citi may also serve as a voluntary advance provider in this capacity the company may but is not obligated to make loan advances to customer tob trusts to purchase optionally tendered floaters that have not otherwise been successfully remarketed to new investors such loans are secured by pledged floaters as of december citi had no outstanding voluntary advances to customer tob trusts for certain noncustomer trusts the company also provides credit enhancement at december and none of the municipal bonds owned by noncustomer tob trusts were subject to a credit guarantee provided by the company citigroup also provides liquidity services to many customer and noncustomer trusts if a trust is unwound early due to an event other than a credit event on the underlying municipal bonds the underlying municipal bonds are sold out of the trust and bond sale proceeds are used to redeem the outstanding trust certificates if this results in a shortfall between the bond sale proceeds and the redemption price of the tendered floaters the company pursuant to the liquidity agreement would be obligated to make a payment to the trust to satisfy that shortfall for certain customer tob trusts citigroup has also executed a reimbursement agreement with the holder of the residual pursuant to which the residual holder is obligated to reimburse the company for any payment the company makes under the liquidity arrangement these reimbursement agreements may be subject to daily margining based on changes in the market value of the underlying municipal bonds in cases where a third party provides liquidity to a noncustomer tob trust a similar reimbursement arrangement may be executed whereby the company or a consolidated subsidiary of the company as residual holder would absorb any losses incurred by the liquidity provider for certain other noncustomer tob trusts citi serves as tender option provider the tender option provider arrangement allows floater holders to put their interests directly to the company at any time subject to the requisite notice period requirements at a price of par at december and liquidity agreements provided with respect to customer tob trusts totaled billion and billion respectively of which billion and billion respectively were offset by reimbursement agreements for the remaining exposure related to tob transactions where the residual owned by the customer was at least of the bond value at the inception of the transaction no reimbursement agreement was executed citi considers both customer and noncustomer tob trusts to be vies customer tob trusts are not consolidated by the company as the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the trusts economic performance rests with the customer residual holder which may unilaterally cause the sale of the trusts bonds noncustomer tob trusts generally are consolidated because the company holds the residual interest and thus has the unilateral power to cause the sale of the trusts bonds the company also provides other liquidity agreements or letters of credit to customersponsored municipal investment funds which are not variable interest entities and municipalityrelated issuers that totaled billion as of december and billion as of december these liquidity agreements and letters of credit are offset by reimbursement agreements with various termout provisions municipal investments municipal investment transactions include debt and equity interests in partnerships that finance the construction and rehabilitation of lowincome housing facilitate lending in new or underserved markets or finance the construction or operation of renewable municipal energy facilities citi generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits and grants earned from the investments made by the partnership the company may also provide construction loans or permanent loans for the development or operation of real estate properties held by partnerships these entities are generally considered vies the power to direct the activities of these entities is typically held by the general partner accordingly these entities are not consolidated by citigroup client intermediation client intermediation transactions represent a range of transactions designed to provide investors with specified returns based on the returns of an underlying security referenced asset or index these transactions include credit linked notes and equitylinked notes in these transactions the vie typically obtains exposure to the underlying security referenced asset or index through a derivative instrument such as a totalreturn swap or a creditdefault swap in turn the vie issues notes to investors that pay a return based on the specified underlying security referenced asset or index the vie invests the proceeds in a financial asset or a guaranteed insurance contract that serves as collateral for the derivative contract over the term of the transaction the companys involvement in these transactions includes being the counterparty to the vies derivative instruments and investing in a portion of the notes issued by the vie in certain transactions the investors maximum risk of loss is limited and the company absorbs risk of loss above a specified level citi does not have the power to direct the activities of the vies that most significantly impact their economic performance and thus it does not consolidate them citis maximum risk of loss in these transactions is defined as the amount invested in notes issued by the vie and the notional amount of any risk of loss absorbed by citi through a separate instrument issued by the vie the derivative instrument held by the company may generate a receivable from the vie eg where the company purchases credit protection from the vie in connection with the vies issuance of a creditlinked note which is collateralized by the assets owned by the vie these derivative instruments are not considered variable interests and any associated receivables are not included in the calculation of maximum exposure to the vie investment funds the company is the investment manager for certain investment funds and retirement funds that invest in various asset classes including private equity hedge funds real estate fixed income and infrastructure citigroup earns a management fee which is a percentage of capital under management and may earn performance fees in addition for some of these funds the company has an ownership interest in the investment funds citi has also established a number of investment funds as opportunities for qualified colleagues to invest in private equity investments the company acts as investment manager for these funds and may provide colleagues with financing on both recourse and nonrecourse bases for a portion of the colleagues investment commitments derivatives in the ordinary course of business citigroup enters into various types of derivative transactions which include futures and forward contracts which are commitments to buy or sell at a future date a financial instrument commodity or currency at a contracted price that may be settled in cash or through delivery of an item readily convertible to cash swap contracts which are commitments to settle in cash at a future date or dates that may range from a few days to a number of years based on differentials between specified indices or financial instruments as applied to a notional principal amount option contracts which give the purchaser for a premium the right but not the obligation to buy or sell within a specified time a financial instrument commodity or currency at a contracted price that may also be settled in cash based on differentials between specified indices or prices swaps forwards and some option contracts are overthe counter otc derivatives that are bilaterally negotiated with counterparties and settled with those counterparties except for swap contracts that are novated and cleared through central counterparties ccps futures contracts and other option contracts are standardized contracts that are traded on an exchange with a ccp as the counterparty from the inception of the transaction citigroup enters into derivative contracts relating to interest rate foreign currency commodity and other marketcredit risks for the following reasons trading purposes citigroup trades derivatives as an active market maker citigroup offers its customers derivatives in connection with their risk management actions to transfer modify or reduce their interest rate foreign exchange and other marketcredit risks or for their own trading purposes citigroup also manages its derivative risk positions through offsetting trade activities controls focused on price verification and daily reporting of positions to senior managers hedging citigroup uses derivatives in connection with its own risk management activities to hedge certain risks or reposition the risk profile of the company hedging may be accomplished by applying hedge accounting in accordance with asc derivatives and hedging or by an economic hedge for example citigroup issues fixedrate longterm debt and then enters into a receive fixed payvariablerate interest rate swap with the same tenor and notional amount to synthetically convert the interest payments to a net variablerate basis this strategy is the most common form of an interest rate hedge as it minimizes net interest cost in certain yield curve environments derivatives are also used to manage market risks inherent in specific groups of onbalance sheet assets and liabilities including afs securities commodities and borrowings as well as other interest sensitive assets and liabilities in addition foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge nonusdollar denominated debt foreign currencydenominated afs securities and net investment exposures derivatives may expose citigroup to market credit or liquidity risks in excess of the amounts recorded on the consolidated balance sheet market risk on a derivative product is the exposure created by potential fluctuations in interest rates market prices foreign exchange rates and other factors and is a function of the type of product the volume of transactions the tenor and terms of the agreement and the underlying volatility credit risk is the exposure to loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to satisfy a derivative liability where the value of any collateral held by citi is not adequate to cover such losses the recognition in earnings of unrealized gains on derivative transactions is subject to managements assessment of the probability of counterparty default liquidity risk is the potential exposure that arises when the size of a derivative position may affect the ability to monetize the position in a reasonable period of time and at a reasonable cost in periods of high volatility and financial stress derivative transactions are customarily documented under industry standard master netting agreements which provide that following an event of default the nondefaulting party may promptly terminate all transactions between the parties and determine the net amount due to be paid to or by the defaulting party events of default include i failure to make a payment on a derivative transaction that remains uncured following applicable notice and grace periods ii breach of agreement that remains uncured after applicable notice and grace periods iii breach of a representation iv cross default either to thirdparty debt or to other derivative transactions entered into between the parties or in some cases their affiliates v the occurrence of a merger or consolidation that results in the creditworthiness of a party becoming materially weaker and vi the cessation or repudiation of any applicable guarantee or other credit support document obligations under master netting agreements are often secured by collateral posted under an industry standard credit support annex to the master netting agreement an event of default may also occur under a credit support annex if a party fails to make a collateral delivery that remains uncured following applicable notice and grace periods the netting and collateral rights incorporated in the master netting agreements are considered to be legally enforceable if a supportive legal opinion has been obtained from counsel of recognized standing that provides i the requisite level of certainty regarding enforceability and ii that the exercise of rights by the nondefaulting party to terminate and closeout transactions on a net basis under these agreements will not be stayed or avoided under applicable law upon an event of default including bankruptcy insolvency or similar proceeding a legal opinion may not be sought for certain jurisdictions where local law is silent or unclear as to the enforceability of such rights or where adverse case law or conflicting regulation may cast doubt on the enforceability of such rights in some jurisdictions and for some counterparty types the insolvency law may not provide the requisite level of certainty for example this may be the case for certain sovereigns municipalities central banks and us pension plans exposure to credit risk on derivatives is affected by market volatility which may impair the ability of counterparties to satisfy their obligations to the company credit limits are established and closely monitored for customers engaged in derivatives transactions citi considers the level of legal certainty regarding enforceability of its offsetting rights under master netting agreements and credit support annexes to be an important factor in its risk management process specifically citi generally transacts much lower volumes of derivatives under master netting agreements where citi does not have the requisite level of legal certainty regarding enforceability because such derivatives consume greater amounts of single counterparty credit limits than those executed under enforceable master netting agreements information pertaining to citigroups derivatives activities based on notional amounts is presented in the table below derivative notional amounts are reference amounts from which contractual payments are derived and do not represent a complete measure of citis exposure to derivative transactions citis derivative exposure arises primarily from market fluctuations ie market risk counterparty failure ie credit risk andor periods of high volatility or financial stress ie liquidity risk as well as any market valuation adjustments that may be required on the transactions moreover notional amounts do not reflect the netting of offsetting trades for example if citi enters into a receive fixed interest rate swap with million notional and offsets this risk with an identical but opposite payfixed position with a different counterparty million in derivative notionals is reported although these offsetting positions may result in de minimis overall market risk cash collateral and security collateral in the form of g10 in addition aggregate derivative notional amounts can government debt securities are often posted by a party to a master netting agreement to secure the net open exposure of the other party the receiving party is free to commingle rehypothecate such collateral in the ordinary course of its business nonstandard collateral such as corporate bonds municipal bonds us agency securities andor mbs may also be pledged as collateral for derivative transactions security collateral posted to open and maintain a master netting agreement with a counterparty in the form of cash andor securities may from time to time be segregated in an account at a thirdparty custodian pursuant to a triparty account control agreement

unrelated to the risks being hedged and the changes in fair value of the derivative associated with time value citi excludes changes in the crosscurrency basis associated with crosscurrency swaps from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and records it in other comprehensive income discontinued hedge accounting a hedging instrument must be highly effective in accomplishing the hedge objective of offsetting either changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item for the risk being hedged management may voluntarily dedesignate an accounting hedge at any time but if a hedging relationship is not highly effective it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting and must be dedesignated subsequent changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in other revenue or principal transactions similar to trading derivatives with no offset recorded related to the hedged item for fair value hedges any changes in the fair value of the hedged item remain as part of the basis of the asset or liability and are ultimately realized as an element of the yield on the item for cash flow hedges changes in fair value of the end user derivative remain in accumulated other comprehensive income loss aoci and are included in the earnings of future periods when the forecasted hedged cash flows impact earnings however if it becomes probable that some or all of the hedged forecasted transactions will not occur any amounts that remain in aoci related to these transactions must be immediately reflected in other revenue the foregoing criteria are applied on a decentralized basis consistent with the level at which market risk is managed but are subject to various limits and controls the underlying asset liability or forecasted transaction may be an individual item or a portfolio of similar items for the years ended december and amounts recognized in principal transactions in the consolidated statement of income include certain derivatives not

december in millions of dollars interest rate contracts foreign exchange total accounting for derivative hedging citigroup accounts for its hedging activities in accordance with asc derivatives and hedging as a general rule hedge accounting is permitted where the company is exposed to a particular risk such as interest rate or foreign exchange risk that causes changes in the fair value of an asset or liability or variability in the expected future cash flows of an existing asset liability or a forecasted transaction that may affect earnings derivative contracts hedging the risks associated with changes in fair value are referred to as fair value hedges while contracts hedging the variability of expected future cash flows are cash flow hedges hedges that utilize derivatives or debt instruments to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with equity investments in nonusdollarfunctional currency foreign subsidiaries net investment in a foreign operation are net investment hedges to qualify as an accounting hedge under the hedge accounting rules versus an economic hedge where hedge accounting is not applied a hedging relationship must be highly effective in offsetting the risk designated as being hedged the hedging relationship must be formally documented at inception detailing the particular risk management objective and strategy for the hedge this includes the item and risks being hedged the hedging instrument being used and how effectiveness will be assessed the effectiveness of these hedging relationships is evaluated at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis both on a retrospective and prospective basis typically using quantitative measures of correlation with hedge ineffectiveness measured and recorded in current earnings hedge effectiveness assessment methodologies are performed in a similar manner for similar hedges and are used fair value hedges hedging of benchmark interest rate risk citigroups fair value hedges are primarily hedges of fixed rate longterm debt or assets such as availableforsale debt securities or loans for qualifying fair value hedges of interest rate risk the changes in the fair value of the derivative and the change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are presented within interest revenue or interest expense based on whether the hedged item is an asset or a liability citigroup has executed a lastoflayer hedge which permits an entity to hedge the interest rate risk of a stated portion of a closed portfolio of prepayable financial assets that are expected to remain outstanding for the designated tenor of the hedge in accordance with asc an entity may exclude prepayment risk when measuring the change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to interest rate risk under the last oflayer approach similar to other fair value hedges where the hedged item is an asset the fair value of the hedged item attributable to interest rate risk will be presented in interest revenue along with the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument hedging of foreign exchange risk citigroup hedges the change in fair value attributable to foreign exchange rate movements in availableforsale debt securities and longterm debt that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity holding the securities or issuing the debt the hedging instrument is generally a forward foreign exchange contract or a crosscurrency swap contract citigroup considers the premium associated with forward contracts ie the differential between the spot and contractual forward rates as the cost of hedging this amount is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and is generally reflected directly in earnings over the life of the hedge citi also excludes changes in crosscurrency basis associated with crosscurrency swaps from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and records it in other comprehensive income hedging of commodity price risk citigroup hedges the change in fair value attributable to spot price movements in physical commodities inventories the hedging instrument is a futures contract to sell the underlying commodity in this hedge the change in the value of the hedged inventory is reflected in earnings which offsets the change in the fair value of the futures contract that is also reflected in earnings although the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument recorded in earnings includes changes in forward rates citigroup excludes the differential between the spot and the contractual forward rates under the futures contract from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and it is generally reflected directly in earnings over the life of the hedge citi also excludes changes in forward rates from the

change in the value of the hedging instrument is required to be recognized in aoci and then recognized in earnings in the same period that the cash flows impact earnings the pretax change in aoci from

forecasted hedged cash flows impact earnings the net gain loss associated with cash flow hedges expected to be reclassified from aoci within months of december is approximately million the maximum length of time over which forecasted cash flows are hedged is years the aftertax impact of cash flow hedges on aoci is shown in note to the consolidated financial statements net investment hedges consistent with asc foreign currency matters foreign currency transactions asc allows the hedging of the foreign currency risk of a net investment in a foreign operation citigroup uses foreign currency forwards cross currency swaps options and foreign currencydenominated debt instruments to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with citigroups equity investments in several non usdollarfunctionalcurrency foreign subsidiaries citigroup records the change in the carrying amount of these investments in foreign currency translation adjustment within aoci simultaneously the effective portion of the hedge of this exposure is also recorded in foreign currency translation adjustment and any ineffective portion is immediately recorded in earnings for derivatives designated as net investment hedges citigroup follows the forwardrate method outlined in asc according to that method all changes in fair value including changes related to the forwardrate component of the foreign currency forward contracts and the time value of foreign currency options are recorded in foreign currency translation adjustment within aoci for foreign currencydenominated debt instruments that are designated as hedges of net investments the translation gain or loss that is recorded in foreign currency translation adjustment is based on the spot exchange rate between the functional currency of the respective subsidiary and the us dollar which is the functional currency of citigroup to the extent that the notional amount of the hedging instrument exactly matches the hedged net investment and the underlying exchange rate of the derivative hedging instrument relates to the exchange rate between the functional currency of the net investment and citigroups functional currency or in the case of a nonderivative debt instrument such instrument is denominated in the functional currency of the net investment no ineffectiveness is recorded in earnings the pretax gain loss recorded in foreign currency translation adjustment within aoci related to net investment hedges was million million and million for the years ended december and respectively economic hedges citigroup often uses economic hedges when hedge accounting would be too complex or operationally burdensome enduser derivatives that are economic hedges are carried at fair value with changes in value included in either principal transactions or other revenue for assetliability management hedging fixedrate long term debt is recorded at amortized cost under gaap for other hedges that either do not meet the asc hedging criteria or for which management decides not to apply asc hedge accounting the derivative is recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with the associated changes in fair value recorded in earnings while the debt continues to be carried at amortized cost therefore current earnings are affected by the interest rate shifts and other factors that cause a change in the swaps value but for which no offsetting change in value is recorded on the debt citigroup may alternatively elect to account for the debt at fair value under the fair value option once the irrevocable election is made upon issuance of the debt the full change in fair value of the debt is reported in earnings the changes in fair value of the related interest rate swap are also reflected in earnings which provides a natural offset to the debts fair value change to the extent that the two amounts differ because the full change in the fair value of the debt includes risks not offset by the interest rate swap the difference is automatically captured in current earnings additional economic hedges include hedges of the credit risk component of commercial loans and loan commitments citigroup periodically evaluates its hedging strategies in other areas and may designate either an accounting hedge or an economic hedge after considering the relative costs and benefits economic hedges are also employed when the hedged item itself is marked to market through current earnings such as hedges of commitments to originate one to fourfamily mortgage loans to be hfs and msrs credit derivatives citi is a market maker and trades a range of credit derivatives through these contracts citi either purchases or writes protection on either a single name or a portfolio of reference credits citi also uses credit derivatives to help mitigate credit risk in its corporate and consumer loan portfolios and other cash positions and to facilitate client transactions citi monitors its counterparty credit risk in credit derivative contracts as of december and approximately and respectively of the gross receivables are from counterparties with which citi maintains master netting agreements collateral agreements or settles daily a majority of citis top counterparties by receivable balance owed to citi are central clearing houses banks financial institutions or other dealers contracts with these counterparties do not include ratingsbased termination events however counterparty ratings downgrades may have an incremental effect by lowering the threshold at which citi may call for additional collateral the range of credit derivatives entered into includes credit default swaps total return swaps credit options and credit linked notes a credit default swap is a contract in which for a fee a protection seller agrees to reimburse a protection buyer for any losses that occur due to a predefined credit event on a reference entity these credit events are defined by the terms of the derivative contract and the reference entity and are generally limited to the market standard of failure to pay on indebtedness and bankruptcy of the reference entity and in a more limited range of transactions debt restructuring credit derivative transactions that reference emerging market entities also typically include additional credit events to cover the acceleration of indebtedness and the risk of repudiation or a payment moratorium in certain transactions protection may be provided on a portfolio of reference entities or assetbacked securities if there is no credit event as defined by the specific derivative contract then the protection seller makes no payments to the protection buyer and receives only the contractually specified fee however if a credit event occurs as defined in the specific derivative contract sold the protection seller will be required to make a payment to the protection buyer under certain contracts the seller of protection may not be required to make a payment until a specified amount of losses has occurred with respect to the portfolio andor may only be required to pay for losses up to a specified amount a total return swap typically transfers the total economic performance of a reference asset which includes all associated cash flows as well as capital appreciation or depreciation the protection buyer receives a floating rate of interest and any depreciation on the reference asset from the protection seller and in return the protection seller receives the cash flows associated with the reference asset plus any appreciation thus according to the total return swap agreement the protection seller will be obligated to make a payment any time the floating interest rate payment plus any depreciation of the reference asset exceeds the cash flows associated with the underlying asset a total return swap may terminate upon a default of the reference asset or a credit event with respect to the reference entity subject to the provisions of the related total return swap agreement between the protection seller and the protection buyer a credit option is a credit derivative that allows investors to trade or hedge changes in the credit quality of a reference entity for example in a credit spread option the option writer assumes the obligation to purchase or sell credit protection on the reference entity at a specified strike spread level the option purchaser buys the right to sell credit default protection on the reference entity to or purchase it from the option writer at the strike spread level the payments on credit spread options depend either on a particular credit spread or the price of the underlying creditsensitive asset or other reference entity the options usually terminate if a credit event occurs with respect to the underlying reference entity a creditlinked note is a form of credit derivative structured as a debt security with an embedded credit default swap the purchaser of the note effectively provides credit protection to the issuer by agreeing to receive a return that could be negatively affected by credit events on the underlying reference entity if the reference entity defaults the note may be cash settled or physically settled by delivery of a debt security of the reference entity thus the maximum amount of the note purchasers exposure is the amount paid for the creditlinked note the

protection purchased and million under protection sold fair values included in the above tables are prior to application of any netting agreements and cash collateral for notional amounts citi generally has a mismatch between the total notional amounts of protection purchased and sold and it may hold the reference assets directly rather than entering into offsetting credit derivative contracts as and when desired the open risk exposures from credit derivative contracts are largely matched after certain cash positions in reference assets are considered and after notional amounts are adjusted either to a durationbased equivalent basis or to reflect the level of subordination in tranched structures the ratings of the credit derivatives portfolio presented in the tables and used to evaluate paymentperformance risk are based on the assigned internal or external ratings of the reference asset or entity where external ratings are used investmentgrade ratings are considered to be baabbb and above while anything below is considered noninvestment grade citis internal ratings are in line with the related external rating system citigroup evaluates the paymentperformance risk of the credit derivatives for which it stands as a protection seller based on the credit rating assigned to the underlying reference credit credit derivatives written on an underlying non investmentgrade reference entity represent greater payment risk to the company the noninvestmentgrade category in the table above also includes credit derivatives where the underlying reference entity has been downgraded subsequent to the inception of the derivative the maximum potential amount of future payments under credit derivative contracts presented in the table above is based on the notional value of the derivatives the company believes that the notional amount for credit protection sold is not representative of the actual loss exposure based on historical experience this amount has not been reduced by the value of the reference assets and the related cash flows in accordance with most credit derivative contracts should a credit event occur the company usually is liable for the difference between the protection sold and the value of the reference assets furthermore the notional amount for credit protection sold has not been reduced for any cash collateral paid to a given counterparty as such payments would be calculated after netting all derivative exposures including any credit derivatives with that counterparty in accordance with a related master netting agreement due to such netting processes determining the amount of collateral that corresponds to credit derivative exposures alone is not possible the company actively monitors open creditrisk exposures and manages this exposure by using a variety of strategies including purchased credit derivatives cash collateral or direct holdings of the referenced assets this risk mitigation activity is not captured in the table above credit riskrelated contingent features in derivatives certain derivative instruments contain provisions that require the company to either post additional collateral or immediately settle any outstanding liability balances upon the occurrence of a specified event related to the credit risk of the company these events which are defined by the existing derivative contracts are primarily downgrades in the credit ratings of the company and its affiliates the fair value excluding cva of all derivative instruments with credit riskrelated contingent features that were in a net liability position at december and was billion and billion respectively the company posted billion and billion as collateral for this exposure in the normal course of business as of december and respectively a downgrade could trigger additional collateral or cash settlement requirements for the company and certain affiliates in the event that citigroup and citibank were downgraded a single notch by all three major rating agencies as of december the company could be required to post an additional billion as either collateral or settlement of the derivative transactions in addition the company could be required to segregate with thirdparty custodians collateral previously received from existing derivative counterparties in the amount of billion upon the single notch downgrade resulting in aggregate cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately billion derivatives accompanied by financial asset transfers the company executes total return swaps that provide it with synthetic exposure to substantially all of the economic return of the securities or other financial assets referenced in the contract in certain cases the derivative transaction is accompanied by the companys transfer of the referenced financial asset to the derivative counterparty most typically in response to the derivative counterpartys desire to hedge in whole or in part its synthetic exposure under the derivative contract by holding the referenced asset in funded form in certain jurisdictions these transactions qualify as sales resulting in derecognition of the securities transferred see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the related sale conditions for transfers of financial assets for a significant portion of the transactions the company has also executed another total return swap where the company passes on substantially all of the economic return of the referenced securities to a different third party seeking the exposure in those cases the company is not exposed on a net basis to changes in the economic return of the referenced securities these transactions generally involve the transfer of the companys liquid government bonds convertible bonds or publicly traded corporate equity securities from the trading portfolio and are executed with thirdparty financial institutions the accompanying derivatives are typically total return swaps the derivatives are cash settled and subject to ongoing margin requirements when the conditions for sale accounting are met the company reports the transfer of the referenced financial asset as a sale and separately reports the accompanying derivative transaction these transactions generally do not result in a gain or loss on the sale of the security because the transferred security was held at fair value in the companys trading portfolio for transfers of financial assets accounted for as a sale by the company and for which the company has retained substantially all of the economic exposure to the transferred asset through a total return swap executed with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial sale and still outstanding both the asset amounts derecognized and the gross cash proceeds received as of the date of derecognition were billion and billion as of december and respectively at december the fair value of these previously derecognized assets was billion the fair value of the total return swaps as of december was million recorded as gross derivative assets and million recorded as gross derivative liabilities at december the fair value of these previously derecognized assets was billion and the fair value of the total return swaps was million recorded as gross derivative assets and million recorded as gross derivative liabilities the balances for the total return swaps are on a gross basis before the application of counterparty and cash collateral netting and are included primarily as equity derivatives in the tabular disclosures in this note concentrations of credit risk concentrations of credit risk exist when changes in economic industry or geographic factors similarly affect groups of counterparties whose aggregate credit exposure is material in relation to citigroups total credit exposure although citigroups portfolio of financial instruments is broadly diversified along industry product and geographic lines material transactions are completed with other financial institutions particularly in the securities trading derivatives and foreign exchange businesses in connection with the companys efforts to maintain a diversified portfolio the company limits its exposure to any one geographic region country or individual creditor and monitors this exposure on a continuous basis at december citigroups most significant concentration of credit risk was with the us government and its agencies the companys exposure which primarily results from trading assets and investments issued by the us government and its agencies amounted to billion and billion at december and respectively the german united kingdom and japanese governments and their agencies which are rated investment grade by both moodys and sp were the next largest exposures the companys exposure to germany amounted to billion and billion at december and respectively the companys exposure to the united kingdom amounted to billion and billion at december and respectively the companys exposure to japan amounted to billion and billion at december and respectively the foreign government exposures are composed of investment securities loans and trading assets the companys exposure to states and municipalities amounted to billion and billion at december and respectively and was composed of trading assets investment securities derivatives and lending activities fair value measurement asc fair value measurement defines fair value establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures about fair value measurements fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and therefore represents an exit price among other things the standard requires the company to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value under asc the probability of counterparty default is factored into the valuation of derivative and other positions and the impact of citigroups own credit risk is also factored into the valuation of derivatives and other liabilities that are measured at fair value fair value hierarchy asc specifies a hierarchy of inputs based on whether the inputs are observable or unobservable observable inputs are developed using market data and reflect market participant assumptions while unobservable inputs reflect the companys market assumptions these two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy level quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets level quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and modelderived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in the market level valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable as required under the fair value hierarchy the company considers relevant and observable market inputs in its valuations where possible the fair value hierarchy classification approach typically utilizes rulesbased and data driven selection criteria to determine whether an instrument is classified as level level or level the determination of whether an instrument is quoted in an active market and therefore considered a level instrument is based upon the frequency of observed transactions and the quality of independent market data available on the measurement date a level classification is assigned where there is observability of prices market inputs to models or where any unobservable inputs are not significant to the valuation the determination of whether an input is considered observable is based on the availability of independent market data and its corroboration for example through observed transactions in the market otherwise an instrument is classified as level determination of fair value for assets and liabilities carried at fair value the company measures fair value using the procedures set out below irrespective of whether the assets and liabilities are measured at fair value as a result of an election a nonrecurring lower ofcostormarket locom adjustment or because they are required to be measured at fair value when available the company uses quoted market prices from active markets to determine fair value and classifies such items as level in some specific cases where a market price is available the company will apply practical expedients such as matrix pricing to calculate fair value in which case the items may be classified as level the company may also apply a pricebased methodology that utilizes where available quoted prices or other market information obtained from recent trading activity in positions with the same or similar characteristics to the position being valued if relevant and observable prices are available those valuations may be classified as level however when there are one or more significant unobservable price inputs those valuations will be classified as level furthermore when a quoted price is considered stale a significant adjustment to the price of a similar security may be necessary to reflect differences in the terms of the actual security or loan being valued or alternatively when prices from independent sources may be insufficient to corroborate a valuation the price inputs are considered unobservable and the fair value measurements are classified as level if quoted market prices are not available fair value is based upon internally developed valuation techniques that use where possible current marketbased parameters such as interest rates currency rates and option volatilities items valued using such internally generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation thus an item may be classified as level even though there may be some significant inputs that are readily observable fair value estimates from internal valuation techniques are verified where possible to prices obtained from independent vendors or brokers vendors and brokers valuations may be based on a variety of inputs ranging from observed prices to proprietary valuation models and the company assesses the quality and relevance of this information in determining the estimate of fair value the following section describes the valuation methodologies used by the company to measure various financial instruments at fair value where appropriate the description includes details of the valuation models the key inputs to those models and any significant assumptions market valuation adjustments generally the unit of account for a financial instrument is the individual financial instrument the company applies market valuation adjustments that are consistent with the unit of account which does not include adjustment due to the size of the companys position except as follows asc permits an exception through an accounting policy election to measure the fair value of a portfolio of financial assets and financial liabilities on the basis of the net open risk position when certain criteria are met citi has elected to measure certain portfolios of financial instruments that meet those criteria such as derivatives on the basis of the net open risk position the company applies market valuation adjustments including adjustments to account for the size of the net open risk position consistent with market participant assumptions valuation adjustments are applied to items classified as level or level in the fair value hierarchy to ensure that the fair value reflects the price at which the net open risk position could be exited these valuation adjustments are based on the bidoffer spread for an instrument in the market when citi has elected to measure certain portfolios of financial investments such as derivatives on the basis of the net open risk position the valuation adjustment may take into account the size of the position credit valuation adjustments cva and funding valuation adjustments fva are applied to the relevant population of overthecounter otc derivative instruments where adjustments to reflect counterparty credit risk own credit risk and term funding risk are required to estimate fair value this principally includes derivatives with a base valuation eg discounted using overnight indexed swap ois requiring adjustment for these effects such as uncollateralized interest rate swaps the cva represents a portfoliolevel adjustment to reflect the risk premium associated with the counterpartys assets or citis liabilities nonperformance risk credit default swap cds market are applied to the expected future cash flows determined in step one citis own credit cva is determined using citispecific cds spreads for the relevant tenor generally counterparty cva is determined using cds spread indices for each credit rating and tenor for certain identified netting sets where individual analysis is practicable eg exposures to counterparties with liquid cdss counterpartyspecific cds spreads are used for fva a term structure of spreads is applied to the expected funding exposures eg the market liquidity spread used to represent the term funding premium associated with certain otc derivatives the cva and fva are designed to incorporate a market view of the credit and funding risk respectively inherent in the derivative portfolio however most unsecured derivative instruments are negotiated bilateral contracts and are not commonly transferred to third parties derivative instruments are normally settled contractually or if terminated early are terminated at a value negotiated bilaterally between the counterparties thus the cva and fva may not be realized upon a settlement or termination in the normal course of business in addition all or a portion of these adjustments may be reversed or otherwise adjusted in future periods in the event of changes in the credit or funding risk associated with the derivative instruments the fva represents a market funding risk premium the table below summarizes

collateral received including where counterparties post collateral to thirdparty custodians citis cva and fva methodologies consist of two steps first the exposure profile for each counterparty is determined using the terms of all individual derivative positions and a monte carlo simulation or other quantitative analysis to generate a series of expected cash flows at future points in time the calculation of this exposure profile considers the effect of credit risk mitigants and sources of funding including pledged cash or other collateral and any legal right of offset that exists with a counterparty through arrangements such as netting agreements individual derivative contracts that are subject to an enforceable master netting agreement with a counterparty are aggregated as a netting

under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase no quoted prices exist for these instruments since fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow technique cash flows are estimated based on the terms of the contract taking into account any embedded derivative or other features these cash flows are discounted using interest rates appropriate to the maturity of the instrument as well as the nature of the underlying collateral generally when such instruments are recorded at fair value they are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy as the inputs used in the valuation are readily observable however certain longdated positions are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy trading account assets and liabilitiestrading securities and trading loans when available the company uses quoted market prices in active markets to determine the fair value of trading securities such items are classified as level of the fair value hierarchy examples include government securities and exchangetraded equity securities for bonds and secondary market loans traded over the counter the company generally determines fair value utilizing various valuation techniques including discounted cash flows pricebased and internal models fair value estimates from these internal valuation techniques are verified where possible to prices obtained from independent sources including thirdparty vendors a pricebased methodology utilizes where available quoted prices or other market information obtained from recent trading activity of assets with similar characteristics to the bond or loan being valued the yields used in discounted cash flow models are derived from the same price information trading securities and loans priced using such methods are generally classified as level however when the primary inputs to the valuation are unobservable or prices from independent sources are insufficient to corroborate valuation a loan or security is generally classified as level fair value estimates from these internal valuation techniques are verified where possible to prices obtained from independent sources including third party vendors when the companys principal exit market for a portfolio of loans is through securitization the company uses the securitization price as a key input into the fair value of the loan portfolio the securitization price is determined from the assumed proceeds of a hypothetical securitization within the current market environment where such a price verification is possible loan portfolios are typically classified as level in the fair value hierarchy for most of the subprime mortgage backed security mbs exposures fair value is determined utilizing observable transactions where available or other valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis utilizing valuation assumptions derived from similar more observable securities as market proxies the valuation of certain assetbacked security abs cdo positions is inferred through the net asset value of the underlying assets of the abs cdo trading account assets and liabilitiesderivatives exchangetraded derivatives measured at fair value using quoted ie exchange prices in active markets where available are classified as level of the fair value hierarchy derivatives without a quoted price in an active market and derivatives executed over the counter are valued using internal valuation techniques these derivative instruments are classified as either level or level depending on the observability of the significant inputs to the model the valuation techniques depend on the type of derivative and the nature of the underlying instrument the principal techniques used to value these instruments are discounted cash flows and internal models such as derivative pricing models eg blackscholes and monte carlo simulations the key inputs depend upon the type of derivative and the nature of the underlying instrument and include interest rate yield curves foreign exchange rates volatilities and correlation investments the investments category includes availableforsale debt and marketable equity securities whose fair values are generally determined by utilizing similar procedures described for trading securities above or in some cases using vendor pricing as the primary source also included in investments are nonpublic investments in private equity and real estate entities determining the fair value of nonpublic securities involves a significant degree of managements judgment as no quoted prices exist and such securities are not generally traded in addition there may be transfer restrictions on private equity securities the companys process for determining the fair value of such securities utilizes commonly accepted valuation techniques including guideline public company analysis and comparable transactions in determining the fair value of nonpublic securities the company also considers events such as a proposed sale of the investee company initial public offerings equity issuances or other observable transactions private equity securities are generally classified as level of the fair value hierarchy in addition the company holds investments in certain alternative investment funds that calculate nav per share including hedge funds private equity funds and real estate funds investments in funds are generally classified as non marketable equity securities carried at fair value the fair values of these investments are estimated using the nav per share of the companys ownership interest in the funds where it is not probable that the investment will be realized at a price other than the nav consistent with the provisions of asu these investments are categorized within the fair value hierarchy and are not included in the tables below see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information shortterm borrowings and longterm debt where fair value accounting has been elected the fair value of nonstructured liabilities is determined by utilizing internal models using the appropriate discount rate for the applicable maturity such instruments are classified as level of the fair value hierarchy when all significant inputs are readily observable the company determines the fair value of hybrid financial instruments including structured liabilities using the appropriate derivative valuation methodology described above in trading account assets and liabilities derivatives given the nature of the embedded risk profile such instruments are classified as

based on the fair values of the instruments for equity securities the price inputs are expressed on an absolute basis not as a percentage of the notional amount both trading and nontrading account derivativesassets and liabilitiesare presented on a gross absolute value basis includes hybrid products uncertainty of fair value measurements relating to unobservable inputs valuation uncertainty arises when there is insufficient or disperse market data to allow a precise determination of the exit value of a fairvalued position or portfolio in todays market this is especially prevalent in level fair value instruments where uncertainty exists in valuation inputs that may be both unobservable and significant to the instruments or portfolios overall fair value measurement the uncertainties associated with key unobservable inputs on the level fair value measurements may not be independent of one another in addition the amount and direction of the uncertainty on a fair value measurement for a given change in an unobservable input depends on the nature of the instrument as well as whether the company holds the instrument as an asset or a liability for certain instruments the pricing hedging and risk management are sensitive to the correlation between various inputs rather than on the analysis and aggregation of the individual inputs the following section describes some of the most significant unobservable inputs used by the company in level fair value measurements correlation correlation is a measure of the extent to which two or more variables change in relation to each other a variety of correlationrelated assumptions are required for a wide range of instruments including equity and credit baskets foreign exchange options credit index tranches and many other instruments for almost all of these instruments correlations are not directly observable in the market and must be calculated using alternative sources including historical information estimating correlation can be especially difficult where it may vary over time and calculating correlation information from market data requires significant assumptions regarding the informational efficiency of the market eg swaption markets uncertainty therefore exists when an estimate of the appropriate level of correlation as an input into some fair value measurements is required changes in correlation levels can have a substantial impact favorable or unfavorable on the value of an instrument depending on its nature a change in the default correlation of the fair value of the underlying bonds comprising a cdo structure would affect the fair value of the senior tranche for example an increase in the default correlation of the underlying bonds would reduce the fair value of the senior tranche because highly correlated instruments produce greater losses in the event of default and a portion of these losses would become attributable to the senior tranche that same change in default correlation would have a different impact on junior tranches of the same structure volatility volatility represents the speed and severity of market price changes and is a key factor in pricing options volatility generally depends on the tenor of the underlying instrument and the strike price or level defined in the contract volatilities for certain combinations of tenor and strike are not observable and need to be estimated using alternative methods such as comparable instruments historical analysis or other sources of market information this leads to uncertainty around the final fair value measurement of instruments with unobservable volatilities the general relationship between changes in the value of an instrument or a portfolio to changes in volatility also depends on changes in interest rates and the level of the underlying index generally long option positions assets benefit from increases in volatility whereas short option positions liabilities will suffer losses some instruments are more sensitive to changes in volatility than others for example an atthemoney option would experience a greater percentage change in its fair value than a deepinthemoney option in addition the fair value of an option with more than one underlying security eg an option on a basket of equities depends on the volatility of the individual underlying securities as well as their correlations yield in some circumstances the yield of an instrument is not observable in the market and must be estimated from historical data or from yields of similar securities this estimated yield may need to be adjusted to capture the characteristics of the security being valued whenever the amount of the adjustment is significant to the value of the security the fair value measurement is classified as level adjusted yield is generally used to discount the projected future principal and interest cash flows on instruments such as assetbacked securities adjusted yield is impacted by changes in the interest rate environment and relevant credit spreads prepayment voluntary unscheduled payments prepayments change the future cash flows for the investor and thereby change the fair value of the security the effect of prepayments is more pronounced for residential mortgagebacked securities prepayment is generally negatively correlated with delinquency and interest rate a combination of low prepayments and high delinquencies amplifies each inputs negative impact on a mortgage securities valuation as prepayment speeds change the weighted average life of the security changes which impacts the valuation either positively or negatively depending upon the nature of the security and the direction of the change in the weighted average life recovery recovery is the proportion of the total outstanding balance of a bond or loan that is expected to be collected in a liquidation scenario for many credit securities eg commercial mortgage backed securities the expected recovery amount of a defaulted property is typically unknown until a liquidation of the property is imminent the assumed recovery of a security may differ from its actual recovery that will be observable in the future generally an increase in the recovery rate assumption increases the fair value of the security an increase in loss severity the inverse of the recovery rate reduces the amount of principal available for distribution and as a result decreases the fair value of the security credit spread credit spread is a component of the security representing its credit quality credit spread reflects the market perception of changes in prepayment delinquency and recovery rates therefore capturing the impact of other variables on the fair value changes in credit spread affect the fair value of securities differently depending on the characteristics and maturity profile of the security for example credit spread is a more significant driver of the fair value measurement of a high yield bond as compared to an investment grade bond generally the credit spread for an investment grade bond is also more observable and less volatile than its high yield counterpart where the fair value of the related collateral is based on an appraised value the loan is generally classified as level in addition for corporate loans appraisals of the collateral are often based on sales of similar assets however because the prices of similar assets require significant adjustments to reflect the unique features of the underlying collateral these fair value measurements are generally classified as level the fair value of nonmarketable equity securities under the measurement alternative is based on observed transaction prices for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer or an internal valuation technique in the case of an impairment where there are insufficient market observations to conclude the inputs are observable where significant adjustments are made to the observed transaction prices or when an internal valuation technique is used the security is classified as level fair value may differ from the observed transaction price due to a number of factors including marketability adjustments and differences in rights and obligations when the observed transaction is not for the identical investment held by citi items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and therefore are not included in the tables above these include assets measured at cost that have been written down to fair value during the periods as a result of an impairment these also include nonmarketable equity securities that have been measured using the measurement alternative and are either i written down to fair value during the periods as a result of an impairment or ii adjusted upward or downward to fair value as a result of a transaction observed during the periods for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer in addition these assets include loans heldfor sale and other real estate owned that are measured at the lower of cost or market value the following
