risk factors macroeconomic and other challenges and uncertainties related to the covid19 pandemic will likely continue to have negative impacts on citis businesses and results of operations and financial condition the covid19 pandemic has become global affecting all of the countries and jurisdictions where citi operates the pandemic and responses to it have had and will likely continue to have a severe impact on global economic conditions although the impacts will likely vary from time to time by region country or state largely depending on the duration and severity of the public health consequences including availability of any effective therapeutic or vaccine and public response these impacts to global economic conditions include among others sharply reduced us and global economic output resulting in significant losses of employment and lower consumer spending cards purchase sales and loan volumes lower interest rates disruption of global supply chains significant disruption and volatility in financial markets closures reduced activity and failures of many businesses leading to loss of revenues and net losses and the institution of social distancing and restrictions on movement in and among the united states and other countries the pandemic has had and will likely continue to have negative impacts on citis businesses revenues expenses credit costs and overall results of operations and financial condition which could be material the extent of the impact on citis financial performance and operations including its ability to execute its business initiatives and strategies will continue to depend on future developments in the us and globally which are uncertain and cannot be predicted including the duration and further spread of the disease as well as the severity of the economic downturn or any delay or weakness in the economic recovery the impact will in part be dependent on government and other actions taken to lessen the health and economic repercussions such as additional fiscal stimulus andor monetary policy actions medical investments and advances restrictions on movement of people transportation and businesses and the effectiveness of past and any future fiscal monetary and other governmental actions ongoing legislative and regulatory changes in the us and globally to address the economic impact from the pandemic such as consumer and corporate relief measures and continued lower interest rates could further affect citis businesses credit costs and results citi could also face challenges including legal and reputational and scrutiny in its implementation of and ongoing efforts to provide these relief measures such implementations and efforts have resulted in and may continue to result in litigation including class actions and regulatory and government actions and proceedings such actions may result in judgments settlements penalties and fines adverse to citi in addition the different types of government actions could vary in scale and duration across jurisdictions and regions with varying degrees of effectiveness the impact of the pandemic on citis consumer and corporate borrowers will also vary by region sector or industry with some borrowers experiencing greater stress levels which could lead to increased pressure on their results of operations and financial condition increased borrowings or credit ratings downgrades thus likely leading to higher credit costs for citi in addition stress levels ultimately experienced by citis borrowers may be different from and more intense than assumptions made in earlier estimates or models used by citi resulting in a further increase in citis allowance for credit losses or net credit losses the pandemic may not be contained for an extended period of time due to a further emergence or reemergence of widespread infections a prolonged health crisis could continue to reduce economic activity in the us and other countries resulting in additional declines in employment and business and consumer confidence and a prolonged period of lower interest rates these factors could further negatively impact global economic activity and markets and citis consumer customers and corporate clients cause a continued decline in citis revenues and the demand for its products and services and further increase citis credit and other costs these factors could also cause a continued increase in citis balance sheet riskweighted assets and allowance for credit loss reserves resulting in a decline in regulatory capital ratios or liquidity measures as well as regulatory demands for higher capital levels andor limitations or reductions in capital distributions such as common share repurchases and dividends moreover any disruption or failure of citis performance of or its ability to perform key business functions as a result of the continued spread of covid19 or otherwise could adversely affect citis operations any disruption to breaches of or attacks on citis information technology systems including from cyber incidents could have adverse effects on citis businesses these systems are supporting a substantial portion of citis employees who have been affected by local pandemic restrictions and have been forced to work remotely in addition these systems interface with and depend on thirdparty systems and citi could experience service denials or disruptions if demand for such systems were to exceed capacity or if a thirdparty system fails or experiences any interruptions citi has also taken measures to maintain the health and safety of its employees however these measures could result in increased expenses and widespread illness could negatively affect staffing within certain functions businesses or geographies in addition citis ability to recruit hire and onboard employees in key areas could be negatively impacted by global pandemic restrictions further it is unclear how the macroeconomic business environment or societal norms may be impacted after the pandemic the postpandemic environment may undergo unexpected developments or changes in financial markets the fiscal monetary tax and regulatory environments and consumer customer and corporate client behavior these developments and changes could have an adverse impact on citis results of operations and financial condition ongoing business and regulatory uncertainties and changes may make citis longer term business balance sheet and budget planning more difficult or costly citi its management and its businesses may also experience increased or different competitive and other challenges in this environment to the extent that it is not able to adapt or compete effectively citi could experience loss of business and its results of operations and financial condition could suffer for additional information about trends uncertainties and risks related to the pandemic as well as citis management of pandemicrelated risks
