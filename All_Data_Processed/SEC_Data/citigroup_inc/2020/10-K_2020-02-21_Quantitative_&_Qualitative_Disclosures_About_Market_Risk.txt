management experience competitive position regulatory environment and in addition to the obligor and facility risk ratings assigned to all exposures citi may classify exposures in the corporate credit portfolio these classifications are consistent with citis interpretation of the us banking regulators definition of criticized exposures which may categorize exposures as special mention substandard doubtful or loss risk ratings and classifications are reviewed regularly and adjusted as appropriate the credit review process incorporates quantitative and qualitative factors including financial and nonfinancial disclosures or metrics idiosyncratic events or changes to the competitive regulatory or macroeconomic environment this includes but is not limited to exposures in those sectors significantly impacted by the pandemic including energy and energyrelated consumer retail commercial real estate and transportation citigroup believes the corporate credit portfolio to be appropriately rated and classified as of december during the year and since the onset of the covid19 pandemic citigroup has taken action to adjust internal ratings and classifications of exposures as both the macroeconomic environment and obligorspecific factors have changed particularly where additional stress has been seen as obligor risk ratings are downgraded the probability of default increases downgrades of obligor risk ratings tend to result in a higher provision for credit losses in addition downgrades may result in the purchase of additional credit derivatives or other risk mitigants to hedge the incremental credit risk or may result in citi seeking to reduce exposure to an obligor or an industry sector citi will continue to review exposures to ensure the appropriate

including commercial banking nonaccrual status is based on the determination that payment of interest or principal is doubtful a corporate loan may be classified as nonaccrual and still be performing under the terms of the loan structure non accrual loans may still be current on interest payments approximately and of citis corporate nonaccrual loans were performing at december september and december respectively consumer nonaccrual status is generally based on aging ie the borrower has fallen behind on payments consumer mortgage loans other than federal housing administration fha insured loans are classified as nonaccrual within days of notification that the borrower has filed for bankruptcy in addition home equity loans are classified as nonaccrual if the related residential first mortgage loan is days or more past due north america citibranded cards and citi retail services are not included because under industry standards credit card loans accrue interest until such loans are

liquidity risks arise from several factors many of which are mostly or entirely outside citis control such as disruptions in the financial markets changes in key funding sources credit spreads changes in citis credit ratings and macroeconomic geopolitical and other conditions for additional information see risk factorsliquidity risks above citis funding and liquidity management objectives are aimed at i funding its existing asset base ii growing its core businesses iii maintaining sufficient liquidity structured appropriately so that citi can operate under a variety of adverse circumstances including potential companyspecific andor market liquidity events in varying durations and severity and iv satisfying regulatory requirements including among other things those related to resolution planning for additional information see resolution plan and total lossabsorbing capacity tlac below citigroups primary liquidity objectives are established by entity and in aggregate across two major categories citibank including citibank europe plc citibank singapore ltd and citibank hong kong ltd and citis nonbank and other entities including the parent holding company citigroup inc citis primary intermediate holding company citicorp llc citis brokerdealer subsidiaries including citigroup global markets inc citigroup global markets ltd and citigroup global markets japan inc and other bank and nonbank subsidiaries that are consolidated into citigroup including citibanamex at an aggregate citigroup level citis goal is to maintain sufficient funding in amount and tenor to fully fund customer assets and to provide an appropriate amount of cash and high quality liquid assets as discussed below even in times of stress in order to meet its payment obligations as they come due the liquidity risk management framework provides that in addition to the aggregate requirements certain entities be selfsufficient or net providers of liquidity including in conditions established under their designated stress tests citis primary sources of funding include i deposits via citis bank subsidiaries which are citis most stable and lowest cost source of longterm funding ii longterm debt primarily senior and subordinated debt primarily issued at the parent and certain bank subsidiaries and iii stockholders equity these sources may be supplemented by shortterm borrowings primarily in the form of secured funding transactions as referenced above citis funding and liquidity framework ensures that the tenor of these funding sources is of sufficient term in relation to the tenor of its asset base the goal of citis assetliability management is to ensure that there is sufficient liquidity and tenor in the liability structure relative to the liquidity profile of the assets this reduces the risk that liabilities will become due before assets mature or are monetized this excess liquidity is held primarily in the form of highquality liquid assets hqla as set forth in the table below citis liquidity is managed via a centralized treasury model by treasury in conjunction with regional and in country treasurers with oversight provided by independent risk management and various asset liability committees alcos at the citigroup region country and business levels pursuant to this approach citis hqla is managed with emphasis on assetliability management and entitylevel liquidity adequacy throughout citi the chief risk officer and citis cfo cochair citigroups alco which includes citis treasurer and other senior executives alcos among other things set the strategy of the liquidity portfolio and monitor its performance significant changes to portfolio asset allocations need to be approved by the alcos liquidity monitoring and measurement stress testing liquidity stress testing is performed for each of citis major entities operating subsidiaries andor countries stress testing and scenario analyses are intended to quantify the potential impact of an adverse liquidity event on the balance sheet and liquidity position and to identify viable funding alternatives that can be utilized these scenarios include assumptions about significant changes in key funding sources market triggers such as credit ratings potential uses of funding and macroeconomic geopolitical and other conditions these conditions include expected and stressed market conditions as well as companyspecific events liquidity stress tests are performed to ascertain potential mismatches between liquidity sources and uses over a variety of time horizons and over different stressed conditions to monitor the liquidity of an entity these stress tests and potential mismatches are calculated with varying frequencies with several tests performed daily given the range of potential stresses citi maintains contingency funding plans on a consolidated basis and for individual entities these plans specify a wide range of readily available actions for a variety of adverse market conditions or

liquidity coverage ratio lcr in addition to internal 30day liquidity stress testing performed for citis major entities operating subsidiaries and countries citi also monitors its liquidity by reference to the lcr generally the lcr is designed to ensure that banks maintain an adequate level of hqla to meet liquidity needs under an acute 30day stress scenario the lcr is calculated by dividing hqla by estimated net outflows over a stressed 30day period with the net outflows determined by applying prescribed outflow factors to various categories of liabilities such as deposits unsecured and secured wholesale borrowings unused lending commitments and derivatives related exposures partially offset by inflows from assets maturing within days banks are required to calculate an addon to address potential maturity mismatches between contractual cash outflows and inflows within the 30day period in determining the total amount of net outflows the minimum lcr requirement is the

outflows note the amounts are presented on an average basis as of december citis average lcr was unchanged sequentially as citis average hqla and net outflows increased proportionately longterm liquidity measurement net stable funding ratio nsfr on october the us banking agencies adopted a final rule to assess the availability of a banks stable funding against a required level the intended purpose of the final rule is to support the ability of financial institutions to provide financial intermediation to businesses and households across a range of market conditions and reduce the possibility of funding shocks compromising a financial institutions liquidity position in general a banks available stable funding will include portions of equity deposits and longterm debt while its required stable funding will be based on the liquidity characteristics of its assets derivatives and commitments standardized weightings will be required to be applied to the various asset and liabilities classes the ratio of available stable funding to required stable funding will be required to be greater than the final rule becomes effective beginning july while public disclosure requirements to report the ratio will occur on a semiannual basis beginning june citi expects to be in compliance with the final rule when the rule is effective loans as part of its funding and

the citigroup parent company and citis nonbank subsidiaries and is a supplementary source of funding for the bank entities longterm debt is an important funding source due in part to its multiyear contractual maturity structure the weighted average maturity of unsecured longterm debt issued by citigroup and its affiliates including citibank with a remaining life greater than one year was approximately years as of december unchanged from september and an increase from the prior year the weightedaverage maturity is calculated based on the contractual maturity of each security for

citigroup was established as an intermediate holding company an ihc for certain of citigroups operating material legal entities citigroup executed an interaffiliate agreement with citicorp citigroups operating material legal entities and certain other affiliated entities pursuant to which citicorp is required to provide liquidity and capital support to citigroups operating material legal entities in the event citigroup were to enter bankruptcy proceedings citi support agreement pursuant to the citi support agreement citigroup made an initial contribution of assets including certain highquality liquid assets and interaffiliate loans contributable assets to citicorp and citicorp became the businessas usual funding vehicle for citigroups operating material legal entities secured funding transactions and short term borrowings citi supplements its primary sources of funding with short term financings that generally include i secured funding transactions consisting of securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase ie repos and ii to a lesser extent shortterm borrowings consisting of commercial paper and borrowings from the fhlb and other market participants secured funding transactions secured funding is primarily accessed through citis broker dealer subsidiaries to fund efficiently both i secured lending activity and ii a portion of the securities inventory held in the context of market making and customer activities citi also executes a smaller portion of its secured funding transactions through its bank entities which are typically collateralized by government debt securities generally daily changes in the level of citis secured funding are primarily due to fluctuations in secured lending activity in the matched book as described below and securities inventory secured funding of billion as of december increased from the prior year and declined from the prior quarter excluding the impact of fx translation secured funding decreased from the prior year and declined sequentially both driven by normal business activity average balances for secured funding were billion for the quarter ended december the portion of secured funding in the brokerdealer subsidiaries that funds secured lending is commonly referred to as matched book activity the majority of this activity is secured by highquality liquid securities such as us treasury securities us agency securities and foreign government debt securities other secured funding is secured by less liquid securities including equity securities corporate bonds and assetbacked securities the tenor of which is generally equal to or longer than the tenor of the corresponding matched book assets the remainder of the secured funding activity in the brokerdealer subsidiaries serves to fund securities inventory held in the context of market making and customer activities to maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market conditions including under periods of stress citi manages these activities by taking into consideration the quality of the underlying collateral and establishing minimum required funding tenors the weighted average maturity of citis secured funding of less liquid securities inventory was greater than days as of december citi manages the risks in its secured funding by conducting daily stress tests to account for changes in capacity tenor haircut collateral profile and client actions in addition citi maintains counterparty diversification by establishing concentration triggers and assessing counterparty reliability and stability under stress

ratings downgrades by moodys fitch or sp could negatively impact citigroups andor citibanks funding and liquidity due to reduced funding capacity including derivative triggers which could take the form of cash obligations and collateral requirements the following information is provided for the purpose of analyzing the potential funding and liquidity impact to citigroup and citibank of a hypothetical simultaneous ratings downgrade across all three major rating agencies this analysis is subject to certain estimates estimation methodologies judgments and uncertainties uncertainties include potential ratings limitations that certain entities may have with respect to permissible counterparties as well as general subjective counterparty behavior for example certain corporate customers and markets counterparties could re evaluate their business relationships with citi and limit transactions in certain contracts or market instruments with citi changes in counterparty behavior could impact citis funding and liquidity as well as the results of operations of certain of its businesses the actual impact to citigroup or citibank is unpredictable and may differ materially from the potential funding and liquidity impacts described below for additional information on the impact of credit rating changes on citi and its applicable subsidiaries see risk factors

sources such as secured financing transactions and other margin requirements for which there are no explicit triggers could also be adversely affected in total as of december citi estimates that a onenotch downgrade of citigroup and citibank across all three major rating agencies could result in increased aggregate cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately billion unchanged from september see also note to the consolidated financial statements as detailed under highquality liquid assets above citigroup has various liquidity resources available to its bank and nonbank entities in part as a contingency for the potential events described above in addition a broad range of mitigating actions are currently included in citigroups and citibanks contingency funding plans for citigroup these mitigating factors include but are not limited to accessing surplus funding capacity from existing clients tailoring levels of secured lending and adjusting the size of select trading books and collateralized borrowings at certain citibank subsidiaries mitigating actions available to citibank include but are not limited to selling or financing highly liquid government securities tailoring levels of secured lending adjusting the size of select trading assets reducing loan originations and renewals raising additional deposits or borrowing from the fhlb or central banks citi believes these mitigating actions could substantially reduce the funding and liquidity risk if any of the potential downgrades described above citibankadditional potential impacts in addition to the above derivative triggers citi believes that a potential downgrade of citibanks senior debtlongterm rating across any of the three major rating agencies could also have an adverse impact on the commercial papershortterm rating of citibank citibank has provided liquidity commitments to consolidated assetbacked commercial paper conduits primarily in the form of asset purchase agreements as of december citibank had liquidity commitments of approximately billion to consolidated assetbacked commercial paper conduits compared to billion as of september for additional information see note to the consolidated financial statements in addition to the abovereferenced liquidity resources of certain citibank entities citibank could reduce the funding and liquidity risk if any of the potential downgrades described above through mitigating actions including repricing or reducing certain commitments to commercial paper conduits in the event of the potential downgrades described above citi believes that certain corporate customers could reevaluate their deposit relationships with citibank this reevaluation could result in clients adjusting their discretionary deposit levels or changing their depository institution which could potentially reduce certain deposit levels at citibank however citi could choose to adjust pricing offer alternative deposit products to its existing customers or seek to attract deposits from new customers in addition to the mitigating actions referenced above these and other strategies to reduce its interest rate risks and implements such strategies when it believes those actions are prudent citi manages interest rate risk as a consolidated companywide position citis clientfacing businesses create interest ratesensitive positions including loans and deposits as part of their ongoing activities citi treasury aggregates these risk positions and manages them centrally operating within established limits citi treasury makes positioning decisions and uses tools such as citis investment securities portfolio companyissued debt and interest rate derivatives to target the desired risk profile changes in citis interest rate risk position reflect the accumulated changes in all nontrading assets and liabilities with potentially large and offsetting impacts as well as in citi treasurys positioning decisions citigroup employs additional measurements including stress testing the impact of nonlinear interest rate movements on the value of the balance sheet and the analysis of portfolio duration and volatility particularly as they relate to mortgage loans and mortgagebacked securities and the potential impact of the change in the spread between different market indices interest rate risk of investment portfoliosimpact on aoci citi also measures the potential impacts of changes in interest rates on the value of its aoci which can in turn impact citis common equity and tangible common equity this will impact citis common equity tier and other regulatory capital ratios citis goal is to benefit from an increase in the market level of interest rates while limiting the impact of changes in aoci on its regulatory capital position aoci at risk is managed as part of the companywide interest rate risk position aoci at risk considers potential changes in aoci and the corresponding impact on the common equity tier capital ratio relative to citis capital generation capacity market risk overview market risk is the potential for losses arising from changes in the value of citis assets and liabilities resulting from changes in market variables such as interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices commodity prices and credit spreads as well as their implied volatilities market risk emanates from both citis trading and nontrading portfolios for additional information on market risk and market risk management see risk factors above each business is required to establish with approval from citis market risk management a market risk limit framework for identified risk factors that clearly defines approved risk profiles and is within the parameters of citis overall risk appetite these limits are monitored by the risk organization including various regional legal entity and business risk management committees citis country and business asset liability committees and the citigroup risk management and asset liability committees in all cases the businesses are ultimately responsible for the market risks taken and for remaining within their defined limits market risk of nontrading portfolios market risk from nontrading portfolios stems from the potential impact of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on citis net interest revenues the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income loss aoci from its debt securities portfolios and capital invested in foreign currencies net interest revenue at risk net interest revenue for interest rate exposure purposes is the difference between the yield earned on the nontrading portfolio assets including customer loans and the rate paid on the liabilities including customer deposits or company borrowings net interest revenue is affected by changes in the level of interest rates as well as the amounts and mix of assets and liabilities and the timing of contractual and assumed repricing of assets and liabilities to reflect market rates citis principal measure of risk to net interest revenue is interest rate exposure ire ire measures the change in expected net interest revenue in each currency resulting solely from unanticipated changes in forward interest rates citis estimated ire incorporates various assumptions including prepayment rates on loans customer behavior and the impact of pricing decisions for example in rising interest rate scenarios portions of the deposit portfolio may be assumed to experience rate increases that are less than the change in market interest rates in declining interest rate scenarios it is assumed that mortgage portfolios experience higher prepayment rates citis estimated ire below assumes that its businesses andor citi treasury make no additional changes in balances or positioning in response to the unanticipated rate changes in order to manage changes in interest rates effectively citi may modify pricing on new customer loans and deposits purchase fixedrate securities issue debt that is either fixed or floating or enter into derivative transactions that have the opposite risk exposures citi regularly assesses the viability of

changes in interest rates on aoci related to investment securities cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments the yearoveryear increase in the estimated impact to net interest revenue primarily reflected changes in citis balance sheet composition and citi treasury positioning the year overyear changes in the estimated impact to aoci and the common equity tier capital ratio primarily reflected the impact of the composition of citi treasurys investment and derivatives portfolio in the event of a parallel instantaneous bps increase in interest rates citi expects that the negative impact to aoci would be offset in shareholders equity through the expected recovery of the impact on aoci through accretion of citis investment portfolio over a period of time as of december citi expects that the negative billion impact to aoci in such a scenario could potentially be offset over approximately months the following table sets forth the estimated impact to citis net interest revenue aoci and the common equity tier capital ratio on a fully implemented basis under five different changes in interest rate scenarios for the us dollar and citis other currencies the bps downward rate scenarios are impacted by the low level of interest rates in several countries and the assumption that market interest rates as well as rates paid to depositors and charged to borrowers do not fall below zero ie the flooring assumption the rate scenarios are also impacted by convexity related to mortgage products in addition in the table below the magnitude of the impact to citis net interest revenue and aoci is greater under scenario as compared to scenario this is because the combination of changes to citis investment portfolio partially offset by changes related to citis

in foreign exchange ratesimpacts on aoci and capital as of december citi estimates that an unanticipated parallel instantaneous appreciation of the us dollar against all of the other currencies in which citi has invested capital could reduce citis tangible common equity tce by approximately billion or as a result of changes to citis foreign currency translation adjustment in aoci net of hedges this impact would be primarily due to changes in the value of the mexican peso euro australian dollar and singapore dollar this impact is also before any mitigating actions citi may take including ongoing management of its foreign currency translation exposure specifically as currency movements change the value of citis net investments in foreign currency denominated capital these movements also change the value of citis riskweighted assets denominated in those currencies this coupled with citis foreign currency hedging strategies such as foreign currency borrowings foreign currency forwards and other currency hedging instruments lessens the impact of foreign currency movements on citis common equity tier capital ratio changes in these hedging strategies as well as hedging costs divestitures and tax impacts can further affect the actual impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on citis capital as compared to an unanticipated parallel shock as described above the effect of citis ongoing management strategies with respect to changes in foreign exchange rates and the impact of these changes on citis tce and common equity tier capital ratio are shown in the table below for

interest rate credit spread foreign exchange equity and commodity risks citis var includes positions that are measured at fair value it does not include investment securities classified as afs or htm for information on these securities see note to the consolidated financial statements citi believes its var model is conservatively calibrated to incorporate fattail scaling and the greater of shortterm approximately the most recent month and longterm three years market volatility the monte carlo simulation involves approximately market factors making use of approximately time series with sensitivities updated daily volatility parameters updated intramonthly and correlation parameters updated monthly the conservative features of the var calibration contribute an approximate addon to what would be a var estimated under the assumption of stable and perfectly normally distributed markets as set forth in the table below citis average trading var increased from to mainly due to significant market volatility during the first half of across all asset classes driven by macroeconomic challenges and uncertainties related to the covid19 pandemic citis average trading and credit

equals the difference between the total var and the sum of the vars tied to each risk type the benefit reflects the fact that the risks within individual and across risk types are not perfectly correlated and consequently the total var on a given day will be lower than the sum of the vars relating to each risk type the determination of the primary drivers of changes to the covariance

assumptions and implementation of the mathematical algorithm in addition product specific backtesting on portfolios is periodically completed as part of the ongoing model performance monitoring process and reviewed with citis us banking regulators furthermore regulatory var back testing as described below is performed against buyand hold profit and loss on a monthly basis for multiple sub portfolios across the organization trading desk level icg business segment and citigroup and the results are shared with us banking regulators material var model and assumption changes must be independently validated within citis risk management organization all model changes including those for the var model are validated by the model validation group within citis model risk management in the event of significant model changes parallel model runs are undertaken prior to implementation in addition significant model and assumption changes are subject to the periodic reviews and approval by citis us banking regulators citi uses the same independently validated var model for both regulatory var and risk management var ie total trading and total trading and credit portfolios vars and as such the model review and validation process for both purposes is as described above regulatory var which is calculated in accordance with basel iii differs from risk management var due to the fact that certain positions included in risk management var are not eligible for market risk treatment in regulatory var the composition of risk management var is discussed under value at risk above the applicability of the var model for positions eligible for market risk treatment under us regulatory capital rules is periodically reviewed and approved by citis us banking regulators in accordance with basel iii regulatory var includes all trading bookcovered positions and all foreign exchange and commodity exposures pursuant to basel iii regulatory var excludes positions that fail to meet the intent and ability to trade requirements and are therefore classified as non trading book and categories of exposures that are specifically excluded as covered positions regulatory var excludes cva on derivative instruments and dva on citis own fair value option liabilities cva hedges are excluded from regulatory var and included in credit riskweighted assets as computed under the advanced approaches for determining riskweighted assets regulatory var backtesting in accordance with basel iii citi is required to perform back testing to evaluate the effectiveness of its regulatory var model regulatory var backtesting is the process in which the daily oneday var at a confidence interval is compared to the buyandhold profit and loss ie the profit and loss impact if the portfolio is held constant at the end of the day and repriced the following day buyandhold profit and loss represents the daily marktomarket profit and loss attributable to price movements in covered positions from the close of the previous business day buyandhold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue net interest fees and commissions intraday trading profit and loss and changes in reserves based on a confidence level citi would expect two to three days in any one year when buyandhold losses exceed the regulatory var given the conservative calibration of citis var model as a result of taking the greater of short and longterm volatilities and fattail scaling of volatilities citi would expect fewer exceptions under normal and stable market conditions periods of unstable market conditions could increase the number of backtesting exceptions the following graph shows the daily buyandhold profit and loss associated with citis covered positions compared to citis oneday regulatory var during as of december four backtesting exceptions were observed at the citigroup level these exceptions occurred in march and were due to losses across multiple businesses during the onset of the pandemicrelated volatility the difference between the of days with buyand hold gains for regulatory var backtesting and the of days with trading net interest and other revenue associated with citis trading businesses shown in the histogram of daily tradingrelated revenue below reflects among other things that a significant portion of citis tradingrelated revenue is not generated from daily price movements on these positions and exposures as well as differences in the portfolio composition of regulatory var and risk management var regulatory trading var and associated buyandhold profit and loss112 months ended december in millions of dollars buyandhold profit and loss as defined by the banking regulators under basel iii represents the daily marktomarket revenue movement attributable to the trading position from the close of the previous business day buyandhold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue and net interest intraday trading profit and loss on new and terminated trades as well as changes in reserves therefore it is not comparable to the tradingrelated revenue presented in the chart of daily tradingrelated revenue above stress testing citi performs market risk stress testing on a regular basis to estimate the impact of extreme market movements it is performed on individual positions and trading portfolios as well as in aggregate inclusive of multiple trading portfolios citis market risk management after consultations with the businesses develops both systemic and specific stress scenarios reviews the output of periodic stress testing exercises and uses the information to assess the ongoing appropriateness of exposure levels and limits citi uses two complementary approaches to market risk stress testing across all major risk factors ie equity foreign exchange commodity interest rate and credit spreads topdown systemic stresses and bottomup businessspecific stresses systemic stresses are designed to quantify the potential impact of extreme market movements on an institutionwide basis and are constructed using both historical periods of market stress and projections of adverse economic scenarios businessspecific stresses are designed to probe the risks of particular portfolios and market segments especially those risks that are not fully captured in var and systemic stresses the systemic stress scenarios and businessspecific stress scenarios at citi are used in several reports reviewed by senior management and also to calculate internal risk capital for trading market risk in general changes in market values are defined over a oneyear horizon for the most liquid positions and market factors changes in market values are defined over a shorter twomonth horizon the limited set of positions and market factors whose market value changes are defined over a twomonth horizon are those that in managements judgment have historically remained very liquid during financial crises even as the trading liquidity of most other positions and market factors materially declined operational risk overview operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes people and systems or from external events this includes legal risk which is the risk of loss including litigation costs settlements and regulatory fines resulting from the failure of citi to comply with laws regulations prudent ethical standards and contractual obligations in any aspect of its businesses but excludes strategic and reputation risks citi also recognizes the impact of operational risk on the reputation risk associated with citis business activities operational risk is inherent in citis global business activities as well as related support functions and can result in losses citi maintains a comprehensive firmwide risk taxonomy to classify operational risks that it faces using standardized definitions across the firms operational risk management framework see discussion below this taxonomy also supports regulatory requirements and expectations inclusive of those related to us basel iii capital requirements ccar process and heightened standards under us banking requirements citi manages operational risk consistent with the overall framework described in managing global riskoverview above citis goal is to keep operational risk at appropriate levels relative to the characteristics of its businesses the markets in which it operates its capital and liquidity and the competitive economic and regulatory environment this includes effectively managing operational risk and maintaining or reducing operational risk exposures within citis operational risk appetite to anticipate mitigate and control operational risk citis independent operational risk management group has established a globaloperational risk management framework with policies and practices for identification measurement monitoring mitigating and reporting operational risks and the overall operating effectiveness of the internal control environment as part of this framework citi has defined its operational risk appetite and established a managers control assessment mca process for self identification of significant operational risks assessment of the performance of key controls and mitigation of residual risk above acceptable levels each major business segment must implement operational risk processes consistent with the requirements of this framework this includes understanding the operational risks they are exposed to designing controls to mitigate identified risks establishing key indicators monitoring and reporting whether the operational risk exposures are in or out of their operational risk appetite having processes in place to bring operational risk exposures within acceptable levels periodically estimate and aggregate the operational risks they are exposed to and ensuring that sufficient resources are available to actively improve the operational risk environment and mitigate emerging risks citi considers operational risks that result from the introduction of new or changes to existing products or result from significant changes in its organizational structures systems processes and personnel citi has a governance structure for the oversight of operational risk exposures through business risk and controls committees brccs which include a citigroup brcc as well as business functions regional and country brccs brccs are chaired by the individuals in the first line of defense and provide escalation channels for senior management to review operational risk exposures including breaches of operational risk appetite key indicators operational risk events and control issues membership includes senior business and functions leadership as well as members of the second line of defense citi also has an operational risk management committee that provides senior management of the second line of defense risk organizations with a platform to assess citis operational risk profile and to review that actions are taken to bring citis operational risk exposures within operational risk appetite members include citis chief risk officer and citis head of operational risk management and senior members of their organizations these members cover multiple dimensions of risk management and include business and regional chief risk officers and senior operational risk managers in addition independent risk management including the operational risk management group works proactively with citis businesses and functions to drive a strong and embedded operational risk management culture and framework across citi the operational risk management group actively challenges business and functions implementation of the operational risk management framework requirements and the quality of operational risk management practices and outcomes information about businesses key operational risks historical operational risk losses and the control environment is reported by each major business segment and functional area citis operational risk profile and related information is summarized and reported to senior management as well as to the audit and risk committees of citis board of directors by the head of operational risk management operational risk is measured through operational risk capital and operational risk regulatory capital for the advanced approaches under basel iii projected operational risk losses under stress scenarios are estimated as a required part of the federal reserve boards

facility in addition to making an interest payment erroneously paid the lenders under the facility an aggregate of approximately million which is an amount equal to the principal balance of the loan at that time human error at citi and at a thirdparty vendor and limitations in citis loan processing systems were the main contributing factors after a careful assessment of the incident citi immediately put in additional controls to prevent similar loan disbursement errors in the future while also embarking on a major upgrade of the loan infrastructure and controls as of february million has been repaid to citi in august citi commenced litigation against certain fund managers of lenders that have not returned the remaining million of erroneously transferred funds and obtained a temporary restraining order against the fund managers and those acting with them freezing the funds from transfer or disbursement on february the court issued a judgment in favor of the defendants

detect respond to and recover from cyber attacks further citi actively participates in financial industry government and crosssector knowledgesharing groups to enhance individual and collective cyber resilience citis technology and cybersecurity risk management program is built on three lines of defense citis first line of defense under the office of the chief information security officer provides frontline business operational and technical controls and capabilities to protect against cybersecurity risks and to respond to cyber incidents and data breaches citi manages these threats through stateoftheart fusion centers which serve as central command for monitoring and coordinating responses to cyber threats the enterprise information security team is responsible for infrastructure defense and security controls performing vulnerability assessments and thirdparty information security assessments employee awareness and training programs and security incident management in each

mitigation practices and capabilities internal audit serves as the third line of defense and independently provides assurance on how effectively the organization as a whole manages cybersecurity risk citi also has multiple senior committees such as the information security risk committee isrc which governs enterpriselevel risk tolerance inclusive of cybersecurity risk citi seeks to proactively identify and remediate technology and cybersecurity risks before they materialize as incidents that negatively affect business operations accordingly the ormtc team independently challenges and monitors capabilities in accordance with citis defined technology and cyber risk appetite statements to address evolving cybersecurity risks and corresponding regulations ormtc and icrmt team collectively also monitor cyber legal and regulatory requirements identify and define emerging risks execute strategic cyber threat assessments perform new products and initiative reviews perform data management risk oversight and conduct cyber risk assurance reviews inclusive of thirdparty assessments in addition ormtc employs tools and oversees and challenges metrics that are both tailored to cybersecurity and technology and aligned with citis overall operational risk management framework to effectively track identify and manage risk compliance risk compliance risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from violations of laws rules or regulations or from nonconformance with prescribed practices internal policies and procedures or ethical standards compliance risk exposes citi to fines civil money penalties payment of damages and the voiding of contracts compliance risk can result in diminished reputation harm to the firms customers limited business opportunities and lessened expansion potential it encompasses the risk of noncompliance with all laws and regulations as well as prudent ethical standards and some contractual obligations it could also include exposure to litigation known as legal risk from all aspects of traditional and nontraditional banking citi seeks to operate with integrity maintain strong ethical standards and adhere to applicable policies and regulatory and legal requirements citi must maintain and execute a proactive compliance risk management crm policy that is designed to manage compliance risk effectively across citi with a view to fundamentally strengthen the compliance risk management culture across the lines of defense taking into account citis risk governance framework and regulatory requirements independent compliance risk managements icrm primary objectives are to drive and embed a culture of compliance and control throughout citi maintain and oversee an integrated crm policy and compliance risk framework that facilitates enterprise wide compliance with local national or crossborder laws rules or regulations citis internal policies standards and procedures and relevant standards of conduct assess compliance risks and issues across product lines functions and geographies supported by globally consistent systems and compliance risk management processes and provide compliance risk data aggregation and reporting capabilities to anticipate control and mitigate compliance risk citi has established the crm policy to achieve standardization and centralization of methodologies and processes and to enable more consistent and comprehensive execution of compliance risk management citi has a commitment as well as an obligation to identify assess and mitigate compliance risks associated with its businesses and functions icrm is responsible for oversight of citis crm policy while all businesses and global control functions are responsible for managing their compliance risks and operating within the compliance risk appetite citi carries out its objectives and fulfills its responsibilities through the compliance risk framework which is composed of the following integrated key activities to holistically manage compliance risk management of citis compliance with laws rules and regulations by identifying and analyzing changes assessing the impact and implementing appropriate policies processes and controls developing and providing compliance training to ensure colleagues are aware of and understand the key laws rules and regulations monitoring compliance risk appetite which is articulated through qualitative compliance risk statements describing citis appetite for certain types of risk and quantitative measures to monitor the companys compliance risk exposure monitoring and testing of compliance risks and controls in assessing conformance with laws rules regulations and internal policies issue identification escalation and remediation to drive accountability including measurement and reporting of compliance risk metrics against established thresholds in support of the crm policy and compliance risk appetite as discussed above citi is working to address the frb and occ consent orders which include improvements to citis compliance risk framework and its enterprisewide application for additional information regarding the consent orders see citis consent order compliance above reputation risk citis reputation is a vital asset in building trust with its stakeholders and citi is diligent in communicating its corporate values to its colleagues customers investors and regulators to support this citi has defined a reputation risk appetite approach under this approach each major business segment has implemented a risk appetite statement and related key indicators to monitor and address weaknesses that may result in significant reputation risks the approach requires that each business segment or region escalates significant reputation risks that require review or mitigation through its reputation risk committee or equivalent the reputation risk committees are part of the governance infrastructure that citi has in place to review the reputation risk posed by business activities sales practices product design or perceived conflicts of interest these committees may also raise potential reputation risks for due consideration by the reputation risk committee at the corporate level the citigroup reputation risk committee may escalate reputation risks to the nomination governance and public affairs committee or other appropriate committee of the citigroup board of directors the reputation risk committees which are composed of citis most senior executives govern the process by which material reputation risks are identified monitored reported managed and escalated and appropriate actions are taken in line with companywide strategic objectives risk appetite thresholds and regulatory expectations while promoting the culture of risk awareness and high standards of integrity and ethical behavior across the company consistent with citis mission and value proposition further the responsibility for maintaining citis reputation is shared by all colleagues who are guided by citis code of conduct colleagues are expected to exercise sound judgment and common sense in decisions and actions they are also expected to promptly and appropriately escalate all issues that present potential reputation risk strategic risk overview citis executive management team led by citis ceo is responsible for the development and execution of citis strategy this strategy is translated into forwardlooking plans that are then cascaded across the organization strategic risk is monitored through a range of practices regular citigroup board of director meetings provide strategic checkpoints where managements progress is assessed and where decisions to refine the strategic direction of the company are evaluated citis executive management team assesses progress against executing the defined plans ceo reviews which include a risk assessment of the plans occur across products regions and functions to focus on progress against executing the plans products regions and functions have internal reviews to assess performance at lower levels across the organization and specific forums exist to focus on key areas that drive strategic risk such as balance sheet management the introduction of new or modified products and services and country management among others in addition to these daytoday practices significant strategic actions such as mergers acquisitions or capital expenditures are reviewed and approved by or notified to the citigroup board of directors uks future relationship with the eu as previously disclosed the uk formally left the european union eu on january subsequently the uk and the eu entered into a trade and cooperation agreement tca that set out preferential arrangements in areas such as trade in goods and in services that became effective on january while entering into the tca avoided a no deal exit scenario many questions remain as to the future relationship between the uk and the eu for example the tca minimally covers financial services the uk and the eu have committed under the tca to negotiate further details regarding financial services but there can be no assurance as to the successful completion or ultimate outcome of those negotiations citi planned extensively for the uk exit from the eu and successfully implemented its transition plans to date however future legislative and regulatory developments in the uk and the eu as a result of the exit may negatively impact citi for additional

libor on december and to extend the publication of all remaining usd libors until june for legacy contracts in addition it is expected that all non usd libor tenors will cease after december citi recognizes that a transition away from and discontinuance of libor presents various risks and challenges that could significantly impact financial markets and market participants including citi for information about citis risks from a transition away from and discontinuation of libor or any other interest rate benchmark see risk factorsstrategic risks above accordingly citi has continued its efforts to identify and manage its libor transition risks citi is also closely monitoring legislative regulatory and other developments related to libor transition matters and relief citi has established a libor governance and implementation program focused on identifying and addressing the libor transition impacts to citis clients operational capabilities and legal and financial contracts among others the program operates globally across citis businesses and functions and includes active involvement of senior management oversight by citis asset liability committee and reporting to the risk management committee of citigroups board of directors as part of the program citi has continued to implement its libor transition action plans and associated roadmaps under the following key workstreams program management transition strategy and risk management customer management including internal communications and training legalcontract management and product management financial exposures and risk management regulatory and industry engagement operations and technology and finance risk tax and treasury during citi continued to participate in a number of working groups formed by global regulators including the alternative reference rates committee arrc convened by the federal reserve board these working groups promote and advance development of alternative reference rates and seek to identify and address potential challenges from any transition to such rates citi also continued to engage with regulators financial accounting bodies and others on libor transition matters moreover citi has continued to identify its libor transition exposures including financial instruments that do not contain contract provisions that adequately contemplate the discontinuance of reference rates and that would require additional negotiation with counterparties citis libor transition efforts include among other things using alternative reference rates in certain newly issued financial instruments and products since citi has issued preferred stock and benchmark debt referencing the secured overnight financing rate sofr as well as updated the libor determination method in its debt documentation with the arrc recommended fallback language in addition in citi transitioned the discounting of centrally cleared eur and usd interest rate derivatives to the euro shortterm rate estr and sofr respectively announced the adoption of the newly published interbank offered rate ibor fallbacks protocol of the international swaps and derivatives association isda for existing ibor derivatives transactions and increased citis virtual client communication efforts including outreach regarding these new industryled protocols and solutions further citi has also been investing in its systems and infrastructure as client activity moves away from libor to alternative reference rates climate risk climate change presents immediate and longterm risks to citi and to its clients and customers with the risks expected to increase over time climate risk refers to the risk of loss arising from climate change and is divided into physical risk and transition risk physical risk considers how chronic and acute climate change eg increased storms drought fires floods can directly damage physical assets eg real estate crops or otherwise impact their value or productivity transition risk considers how changes in policy technology and market preference to address climate change eg carbon price policies power generation shifts from fossil fuels to renewable energy can lead to changes in the value of assets commodities and companies climate risk is an overarching risk that can act as a driver of other types of risk in the citi risk taxonomy such as credit risk from obligors exposed to high climate risk reputational risk from increased stakeholder concerns about financing high carbon industries and operational risk from physical climate risks to citis facilities citi currently identifies climate risk as an emerging risk within its risk governance framework emerging risks are risks or thematic issues that are either new to the landscape or in the case of climate risk existing risks that are rapidly changing or evolving in an escalating fashion which are difficult to assess due to limited data or other uncertainties for additional information on climate risk see risk factors strategic risk above with the increased importance and focus on climate risk citi has continued to expand its governance of climate risk and integrate climate considerations into the priorities of citigroups board of directors and senior management in particular citi has appointed a chief sustainability officer appointed a head of climate risk to partner with the head of environmental and social risk management to deliver a companywide strategy concerning climate risk formed a global crossfunctional seniorexecutive level climate risk advisory council to provide oversight of and guidance to citis climate risk integration efforts and increased the frequency and depth of board and senior level review of climaterelated matters citi manages and mitigates the credit and reputational risks from climate change through a number of internal initiatives including citis environmental and social risk management esrm policy first established in the esrm policy is part of citis broader credit risk management policy and is applicable to all citi entities globally the esrm policy provides the framework for how citi identifies mitigates and manages the potential environmental and social risks including climate risks associated with clients activities that could lead to credit or reputation risks to the company it guides how citi evaluates lending underwriting and advisory in environmentally sensitive andor highcarbon sectors and presents opportunities for citi to engage clients on solutions to thematic risks in projectrelated lending citis esrm policy incorporates the updates from the fourth iteration of the equator principles which citi helped shape that expands climate risk requirements to include physical risk as well as transition risk citis esrm policy covers lending and underwriting with identified use of proceeds directed to physical assets and activities as well as sector standards for corporate relationships in higherrisk sectors including carbonintensive sectors in citi updated its sector standards for thermal and coal mining coalfired power and arctic oil and gas citi has also made climate risk one of the three key pillars of its sustainable progress strategy under this pillar citi intends to measure manage and reduce the climate risk and impact of its client portfolios and enhance its taskforce on climaterelated financial disclosures tcfd implementation and disclosure through policy development portfolio analysis and client engagement in december citi released its second report detailing its implementation of the tcfd recommendations finance for a climateresilient future ii in this report citi discusses its implementation of the tcfd recommendations and citis recent pilot testing of climate scenario analyses to assess climaterelated impacts and risks in specific sectors spanning both transition and physical climate risks climate data is still improving in terms of its accessibility and reliability and the industry and citi continue to develop better methodological approaches toward assessing climate change impacts nonetheless citi expects to integrate more quantitative analysis of climate risks into credit assessments in the future and to quantify the carbon emissions associated with its client portfolios citi will continue to disclose its progress in this area in its annual environmental social and governance esg report and tcfd reporting in addition citi continues to participate in financial industry collaborations to develop and pilot new methodologies and approaches for measuring and assessing the potential financial risks of climate change citi is also closely monitoring regulatory developments on climate risk and sustainable finance

total exposure as of december would represent approximately of citis exposure to all countries for purposes of the table loan amounts are reflected in the country where the loan is booked which is generally based on the domicile of the borrower for example a loan to a chinese subsidiary of a switzerlandbased corporation will generally be categorized as a loan in china in addition citi has developed regional booking centers in certain countries most significantly in the united kingdom uk and ireland in order to more efficiently serve its corporate customers as an example with respect to the uk only of corporate loans presented in the table below are to uk domiciled entities for unfunded commitments with the balance of the loans predominately to european domiciled counterparties

is located in that country argentina as previously disclosed citi operates in argentina through its icg businesses as of december citis net investment in its argentine operations was approximately billion citi uses the us dollar as the functional currency for its operations in argentina because the argentine economy is considered highly inflationary under us gaap during august the argentine government announced the successful restructuring of almost all of its foreign currency debt issued under foreign law for which it had previously postponed principal and interest payments however during september the argentine government tightened its existing capital and currency controls which continue to restrict citis ability to access us dollars in argentina and remit earnings from its argentine operations citis net investment in its argentine operations is likely to increase as citi generates net income in its argentine franchise and its earnings are unable to be remitted citi economically hedges the foreign currency risk in its net argentine pesodenominated assets to the extent possible and prudent using nondeliverable forward ndf derivative instruments that are primarily executed outside of argentina as of december the international ndf market had very limited liquidity resulting in citis being unable to economically hedge nearly all of its argentine peso exposure as a result and to the extent that citi does not execute ndf contracts for this unhedged exposure in the future citi would record devaluations on its net argentine pesodenominated assets in earnings without any benefit from a change in the fair value of derivative positions used to economically hedge the exposure citi continually evaluates its economic exposure to its argentine counterparties and reserves for changes in credit risk and sovereign risk associated with its argentine assets citi believes it has established appropriate allowances for credit losses on its argentine loans and appropriate fair value adjustments on argentine assets and liabilities measured at fair value for such risks under us gaap as of december however us regulatory agencies may require citi to record additional reserves in the future increasing icgs cost of credit based on the perceived country risk associated with its argentine exposures for additional information on emerging markets risks see risk factors above ffieccrossborder claims on third parties and local country assets citis crossborder disclosures are based on the country exposure bank regulatory reporting guidelines of the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec the following summarizes some of the ffiec key reporting guidelines amounts are based on the domicile of the ultimate obligor counterparty collateral only including qualifying liquid collateral issuer or guarantor as applicable eg a security recorded by a citi us entity but issued by the uk government is considered uk exposure a loan recorded by a citi mexico entity to a customer domiciled in mexico where the underlying collateral is held in germany is considered german exposure amounts do not consider the benefit of collateral received for secured financing transactions ie repurchase agreements reverse repurchase agreements and securities loaned and borrowed and are reported based on notional amounts netting of derivative receivables and payables reported at fair value is permitted but only under a legally binding netting agreement with the same specific counterparty and does not include the benefit of margin received or hedges credit default swaps cds are included based on the gross notional amount sold and purchased and do not include any offsetting cds on the same underlying entity loans are reported without the benefit of hedges given the requirements noted above citis ffiec cross border exposures and total outstandings tend to fluctuate in some cases significantly from period to period as an example because total outstandings under ffiec guidelines do not include the benefit of margin or hedges market volatility in interest rates foreign exchange rates and credit spreads may cause significant fluctuations in
