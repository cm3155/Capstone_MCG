risk factors macroeconomic and other challenges and uncertainties related to the covid19 pandemic will likely continue to have negative impacts on citis businesses and results of operations and financial condition the covid19 pandemic has had and will likely continue to have negative impacts on citis businesses revenues expenses credit costs and overall results of operations and financial condition which could be material the pandemic and responses to it have had and will likely continue to have a severe impact on global economic conditions including sharply reduced us and global economic output and employment disruption of global supply chains significant disruption and volatility in financial markets temporary closures reduced activity and failures of many businesses leading to loss of revenues and net losses and the institution of social distancing and restrictions on movement in the united states and other countries the extent of the covid19 pandemics impact on citis financial performance and operations including its ability to execute its business initiatives and strategies will depend on future developments in the us and globally which are uncertain and cannot be predicted including the duration and further spread of the disease the impact will in part be dependent on government and other actions taken to lessen the health and economic repercussions such as restrictions on movement of people transportation and businesses and various fiscal monetary and other governmental actions ongoing legislative and regulatory changes in the us and globally to address the economic impact from the pandemic such as consumer and corporate relief measures could further affect citis businesses and results citi could also face challenges including legal and reputational and scrutiny in its implementation of and ongoing efforts to provide these relief measures in addition the different types of government actions could vary in scale and duration across jurisdictions and regions with varying degrees of effectiveness the impact of the pandemic on citis consumer and corporate borrowers will also vary by region sector or industry with some borrowers experiencing greater stress levels which could lead to increased pressure on the results of operations and financial condition of such borrowers increased borrowings or ratings downgrades thus likely leading to higher loan losses in addition stress levels ultimately experienced by citis borrowers may be different from and more intense than assumptions made in earlier estimates or models used by citi during or prior to the emergence of the pandemic the pandemic may not be fully contained for an extended period of time with the reemergence of widespread infections possible a prolonged health crisis could continue to reduce economic activity in the us and other countries resulting in a further decline in employment and business and consumer confidence these factors could further negatively impact global economic activity and citis consumer customers and corporate clients cause a continued decline in citis revenues and the use of its products and services and further increase citis credit and other costs these factors could also cause a continued increase in citis balance sheet and riskweighted assets resulting in a decline in regulatory capital ratios or liquidity measures moreover any disruption or failure of citis performance of or its ability to perform key business functions as a result of the continued spread of covid19 or otherwise could adversely affect citis operations a substantial portion of citis employees have been affected by local covid19 restrictions and have been forced to work remotely as a result any disruption to citis information technology systems including from cyber incidents could have adverse effects on citis businesses in addition these systems interface with and depend on thirdparty systems and citi could experience service denials or disruptions if demand for such systems were to exceed capacity or if a thirdparty system fails or experiences any interruptions citi has also taken measures to maintain the health and safety of its employees however widespread illness could negatively affect staffing within certain functions businesses or geographies in addition citis ability to recruit hire and onboard employees in key areas could be negatively impacted by global covid19 restrictions further it is unclear how the macroeconomic business environment or societal norms may be impacted after the pandemic the postcovid19 environment may undergo unexpected developments or changes in financial markets the fiscal tax and regulatory environments and consumer customer and corporate client behavior these developments and changes could have an adverse impact on citis results of operations and financial condition ongoing business and regulatory uncertainties and changes may make citis longerterm business balance sheet and budget planning more difficult or costly citi its management and its businesses may also experience increased or different competitive and other challenges in this environment to the extent that citi is not able to adapt or compete effectively the company could experience loss of business and its results of operations and financial condition could suffer for additional information about
