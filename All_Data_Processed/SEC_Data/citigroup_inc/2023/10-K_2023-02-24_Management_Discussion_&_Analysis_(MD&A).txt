commodities particularly with corporate clients as the business assisted those clients in managing risk associated with the increased volatility equity markets revenues decreased driven by equity derivatives primarily reflecting lower activity by both corporate and institutional clients compared to a strong prior year the lower revenues also reflected a decline in equity cash driven by lower

underpinned by supporting capabilities which are the infrastructure people technology and data and modelling and analytical capabilities that are in place to enable the execution of the erm framework citis approach to risk management requires that its risk taking be consistent with its risk appetite the risk appetite is the aggregate level and types of risk citi is willing to take or tolerate in order to meet its strategic objectives and business plan citis risk appetite framework is the overall firmwide approach including policies processes controls and systems through which the risk appetite is established communicated and monitored in addition underlying risk limits and thresholds are designed to control concentrations and operationalize risk appetite citis risks are generally categorized and summarized as follows credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the decline in credit quality or downgrade risk or failure of a borrower counterparty third party or issuer to honor its financial or contractual obligations liquidity risk is the risk that citi will not be able to efficiently meet both expected and unexpected current and future cash flow and collateral needs without adversely affecting either daily operations or financial conditions of citi market risk trading and nontrading market risk of trading portfolios is the risk of loss arising from changes in the value of citis assets and liabilities resulting from changes in market variables such as interest rates exchange rates equity and commodity prices or credit spreads market risk of nontrading

significant estimatesallowance for credit losses below and notes and as well as through regular stress testing at the company business geography and product levels these stresstesting processes typically estimate potential incremental credit costs that would occur as a result of either downgrades in the credit quality or defaults of the obligors or counterparties see note for additional

markets changes in key funding sources credit spreads changes in citis credit ratings and macroeconomic geopolitical and other conditions for additional information see risk factorsliquidity risks above citis funding and liquidity management objectives are aimed at i funding its existing asset base ii growing its core businesses iii maintaining sufficient liquidity structured appropriately so

requirements including but not limited to those related to resolution planning for additional information see resolution plan and total lossabsorbing capacity tlac below citigroups primary liquidity

global markets limited and citigroup global markets japan inc and other bank and nonbank subsidiaries that are consolidated into citigroup including citibanamex at an aggregate citigroup level citis goal is to maintain sufficient funding in amount and tenor to fully fund customer assets and to provide an appropriate amount of cash and high quality liquid assets as discussed below even in times of stress in order to meet its payment obligations as they come due the liquidity risk management framework provides that in addition to the aggregate requirements certain entities be selfsufficient or net providers of liquidity including in conditions established under their designated stress tests citis primary funding sources include i corporate and consumer deposits via citis bank subsidiaries including citibank na citibank ii longterm debt primarily senior and subordinated debt mainly issued by citigroup inc as the parent and citibank and iii stockholders equity these sources may be supplemented by shortterm borrowings primarily in the form of secured funding transactions citis funding and liquidity framework working in concert with overall assetliability management ensures that there is sufficient liquidity and tenor in the overall liability structure including funding products of the company relative to the liquidity requirements of citis assets this reduces the risk that liabilities will become due before assets mature or are monetized the company holds excess liquidity primarily in the form of highquality liquid assets hqla as presented in the table below citis liquidity is managed centrally by corporate treasury in conjunction with regional and incountry treasurers with oversight provided by independent risk management and various asset liability committees

primary governance committees for managing citis balance sheet and liquidity as a supplement to alco citis funding and liquidity risk committee flrc is focused on funding and liquidity risk matters the flrc reviews and discusses the funding and liquidity risk profile of as well as risk management practices for citigroup and citibank and reports its findings and recommendations to each relevant alco as appropriate liquidity monitoring and measurement stress testing liquidity stress testing is performed for each of citis major entities operating subsidiaries and countries stress testing and scenario analyses are intended to quantify the potential impact of an adverse liquidity event on the balance sheet and liquidity position in order to have sufficient liquidity on hand to manage through such an event these scenarios include assumptions about significant changes in key funding sources market triggers such as credit ratings potential uses of funding and macroeconomic geopolitical and other conditions these conditions include expected and stressed market conditions as well as companyspecific events liquidity stress tests are performed to ascertain potential mismatches between liquidity sources and uses over a variety of time horizons and over different stressed conditions to monitor the liquidity of an entity these stress tests and potential mismatches are calculated on a daily basis given the range of potential stresses citi maintains contingency funding plans on a consolidated basis and for individual entities these plans specify a wide range of

debt with original maturities of one year or more represents the most significant component of citis funding for the citigroup parent company and citis nonbank subsidiaries and is a supplementary source of funding for the bank entities longterm debt is an important funding source due in part to its multiyear contractual maturity structure the weighted average maturity of unsecured longterm debt issued by citigroup and its affiliates including citibank with a remaining life greater than one year was approximately years as of december compared to years as of the prior year and years as of

weightedaverage maturity is calculated based on the earliest date an option becomes exercisable citis longterm debt outstanding at the citigroup parent company includes benchmark senior and subordinated debt and what citi refers to as customerrelated debt consisting of structured notes such as equity and creditlinked notes as well as nonstructured notes citis issuance of customer related

bankruptcy estate for the benefit of citigroups creditors including its unsecured longterm debt holders in addition in line with the frbs final total loss absorbing capacity tlac rule citigroup believes it has developed the resolution plan so that citigroups shareholders and unsecured creditorsincluding its unsecured longterm debt holdersbear any losses resulting from citigroups bankruptcy accordingly any value realized by holders of its unsecured longterm debt may not be sufficient to repay the amounts owed to such debt holders in the event of a bankruptcy or other resolution

feedback received from the frb and fdic citigroup took the following actions i ii iii citicorp llc citicorp an existing wholly owned subsidiary of citigroup was established as an intermediate holding company an ihc for certain of citigroups operating material legal entities citigroup executed an interaffiliate agreement with citicorp citigroups operating material legal entities and certain other

proceedings citi support agreement pursuant to the citi support agreement the remainder of the secured funding activity in the brokerdealer subsidiaries serves to fund securities inventory held in the context of market making and customer activities to maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market conditions including under periods of stress citi manages these activities by taking into consideration the quality of the underlying collateral and establishing minimum required funding tenors the weighted average maturity of citis secured funding of less liquid securities inventory was greater than days as of december citi manages the risks in its secured funding by conducting daily stress tests to account for changes in capacity tenor haircut collateral profile and client actions in addition citi maintains counterparty diversification by establishing concentration triggers and assessing counterparty reliability and stability under stress citi generally sources secured funding from more than counterparties shortterm borrowings citis shortterm borrowings of billion as of the fourth quarter of increased yearoveryear reflecting an increase in fhlb advances and commercial paper issuance as citi continues to diversify its funding profile and decreased sequentially driven by normal business activity see note for further information on citigroups and its affiliates outstanding shortterm borrowings secured funding transactions and short term borrowings citi supplements its primary sources of funding with short term financings that generally include i secured funding transactions consisting of securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase ie repos and ii to a lesser extent shortterm borrowings consisting of commercial paper and borrowings from the fhlb and other market participants secured funding transactions secured funding is primarily accessed through citis broker dealer subsidiaries to fund efficiently both i secured lending activity and ii a portion of the securities inventory held in the context of market making and customer activities citi also executes a smaller portion of its secured funding transactions through its bank entities which are typically collateralized by government debt securities generally daily changes in the level of citis secured funding are primarily due to fluctuations in secured lending activity in the matched book as described below and securities inventory secured funding of billion as of december increased from the prior year and was unchanged sequentially driven by normal business activity the average balance for secured funding was approximately billion for the quarter ended december the portion of secured funding in the brokerdealer subsidiaries that funds secured lending is commonly referred to as matched book activity the majority of this activity is secured by highquality liquid securities such as us treasury securities us agency securities and foreign government debt securities other secured funding is secured by less liquid securities including equity securities corporate bonds and assetbacked securities the tenor of which is generally equal to or longer than the tenor of the corresponding matched book assets credit ratings citigroups funding and liquidity funding capacity ability to access capital markets and other sources of funds the cost of these funds and its ability to maintain certain deposits are partially dependent on its credit ratings the table below shows the ratings for citigroup and citibank as of december while not included in the table below

december fitch ratings fitch moodys investors service moodys sp global ratings sp potential impacts of ratings downgrades ratings downgrades by fitch moodys or sp could negatively impact citigroups andor citibanks funding and liquidity due to reduced funding capacity including derivative triggers which could take the form of cash obligations and collateral requirements the following information is provided for the purpose of analyzing the potential funding and liquidity impact to citigroup and citibank of a hypothetical simultaneous ratings downgrade across all three major rating agencies this analysis is subject to certain estimates estimation methodologies judgments and uncertainties uncertainties include potential ratings limitations that certain entities may have with respect to permissible counterparties as well as general subjective counterparty behavior for example certain corporate customers and markets counterparties could re evaluate their business relationships with citi and limit transactions in certain contracts or market instruments with citi changes in counterparty behavior could impact citis funding and liquidity as well as the results of operations of certain of its businesses the actual impact to citigroup or citibank is unpredictable and may differ materially from the potential funding and liquidity impacts described below for additional information on the impact of credit rating changes on citi and its applicable subsidiaries see risk factors liquidity risks above citigroup inc and citibankpotential derivative triggers as of december citi estimates that a hypothetical onenotch downgrade of the senior debtlongterm rating of citigroup inc across all three major rating agencies could impact citigroups funding and liquidity due to

which there are no explicit triggers could also be adversely affected in total as of december citi estimates that a onenotch downgrade of citigroup inc and citibank across all three major rating agencies could result in increased aggregate cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately billion compared to billion as of september see also note as detailed under highquality liquid assets hqla above citigroup has various liquidity resources available to its bank and nonbank entities in part as a contingency for the potential events described above in addition a broad range of mitigating actions are currently included in citigroups and citibanks contingency funding plans for citigroup these mitigating factors include but are not limited to accessing surplus funding capacity from existing clients tailoring levels of secured lending and adjusting the size of select trading books and collateralized borrowings at certain citibank subsidiaries mitigating actions available to citibank include but are not limited to selling or financing highly liquid government securities tailoring levels of secured lending adjusting the size of select trading assets reducing loan originations and renewals raising additional deposits or borrowing from the fhlb or central banks citi believes these mitigating actions could substantially reduce the funding and liquidity risk if any of the potential downgrades described above citibankadditional potential impacts in addition to the above derivative triggers citi believes that a potential downgrade of citibanks senior debtlongterm rating across any of the three major rating agencies could also have an adverse impact on the commercial papershortterm rating of citibank citibank has provided liquidity commitments to consolidated assetbacked commercial paper conduits primarily in the form of asset purchase agreements as of december citibank had liquidity commitments of approximately billion to consolidated assetbacked commercial paper conduits compared to billion as of december see note for additional information in addition to the abovereferenced liquidity resources of certain citibank entities citibank could reduce the funding and liquidity risk if any of the potential downgrades described above through mitigating actions including repricing or reducing certain commitments to commercial paper conduits in the event of the potential downgrades described above citi believes that certain corporate customers could reevaluate their deposit relationships with citibank this reevaluation could result in clients adjusting their discretionary deposit levels or changing their depository institution which could potentially reduce certain deposit levels at citibank however citi could choose to adjust pricing offer alternative deposit products to its existing customers or seek to attract deposits from new customers in addition to the mitigating actions referenced above market risk overview market risk is the potential for losses arising from changes in the value of citis assets and liabilities resulting from changes in market variables such as interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices commodity prices and credit spreads as well as their implied volatilities market risk arises from both citis trading and nontrading portfolios for additional information on market risk and market risk management at citi see risk factors above each business is required to establish with approval from citis market risk management a market risk limit framework for identified risk factors that clearly defines approved risk profiles and is within the parameters of citis overall risk appetite these limits are monitored by the risk organization including various regional legal entity and business risk management committees citis country and business asset liability committees and the citigroup risk management and asset liability committees in all cases the businesses are ultimately responsible for the market risks taken and for remaining within their defined limits market risk of nontrading portfolios market risk from nontrading portfolios stems predominantly from the potential impact of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on citis net interest income and on citis accumulated other comprehensive income loss aoci from its investment securities portfolios market risk from nontrading portfolios also includes the potential impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on citis capital invested in foreign currencies banking book interest rate risk for interest rate risk purposes citis nontrading portfolios are referred to as the banking book management of interest rate risk in the banking book is governed by citis nontrading market risk policy managements asset liability committee alco establishes citis risk appetite and related limits for interest rate risk in the banking book which are subject to approval by citigroups board of directors corporate treasury is responsible for the daytoday management of citis banking book interest rate risk as well as periodically reviewing it with the alco citis banking book interest rate risk management is also subject to independent oversight from treasury risk management a second line of defense team reporting to the treasury chief risk officer changes in interest rates impact citis net income aoci and cet1 these changes primarily affect citis banking book through net interest income due to a variety of risk factors including differences in timing and amounts of the maturity or repricing of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments changes in level andor shape of interest rate curves client behavior in response to changes in interest rate eg mortgage prepayments deposit betas and changes in maturity of instruments resulting from changes in interest rate environment as part of their ongoing activities citis businesses generate interest ratesensitive positions from their clientfacing products such as loans and deposits the component of this interest rate risk that can be hedged is transferred via citis funds transfer pricing process to corporate treasury corporate treasury uses various tools to manage the total interest rate risk position within the established risk appetite and target citis desired risk profile including its investment securities portfolio companyissued debt and interest rate derivatives in addition citi uses multiple metrics to measure its banking book interest rate risk interest rate exposure ire is a key metric that analyzes the impact of a range of scenarios on citis banking book net interest income and certain other interest ratesensitive income versus a base case ire does not represent a forecast of citis net interest income the scenarios methodologies and assumptions used in this analysis are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the market environment changes in citis balance sheet composition enhancements in citis modeling and other factors since the third quarter of citi has employed enhanced ire methodologies and changes to certain assumptions the changes included among other things assumptions around the projected balance sheet and revisions to the treatment of certain business contributions notably accrual positions in icgs markets businesses these changes resulted in a higher impact to citis net interest income over a 12month period under the enhanced methodology citi utilizes the most recent quarterend balance sheet assuming no changes to its composition and size over the forecasted horizon holding the balance sheet static the forecasts incorporate expectations and assumptions of deposit pricing loan spreads and mortgage prepayment behavior implied by the interest rate curves in each scenario the base case scenario reflects the market implied forward interest rates and sensitivity scenarios assume instantaneous shocks to the base case the forecasts do not assume citi takes any riskmitigating actions in response to changes in the interest rate environment certain interest rates are subject to flooring assumptions in downward rate scenarios deposit pricing sensitivities ie deposit betas are informed by historical and expected behavior actual deposit pricing could differ from the assumptions used in these forecasts citis ire analysis primarily reflects the impacts from the following banking book assets and liabilities loans client deposits citis deposits with other banks investment securities longterm debt any related interest rate hedges and the funds transfer pricing of positions in total trading and credit portfolio var it excludes impacts from any positions that are included in total trading and credit portfolio var interest rate risk of investment portfoliosimpact on aoci citi also measures the potential impacts of changes in interest rates on the value of its aoci which can in turn impact citis common equity and tangible common equity this will impact citis cet1 and other regulatory capital ratios citi seeks to manage its exposure to changes in the market level of interest rates while limiting the potential impact on its aoci and regulatory capital position aoci at risk is managed as part of the companywide interest rate risk position aoci at risk considers potential changes in aoci and the corresponding impact on the cet1 capital ratio relative to citis capital generation capacity the following table presents the 12month estimated impact to citis net interest income aoci and the cet1 capital ratio each

implemented in september most notably the banking book revisions to the treatment of certain business includes the effect of changes in interest rates on aoci related to investment securities cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments citis balance sheet is asset sensitive assets reprice faster than liabilities resulting in higher net interest income in increasing interest rate scenarios the estimated impact to citis net interest income in a bps upward rate shock scenario as of december decreased quarteroverquarter and year overyear primarily reflecting the net impact of lower expected gains due to us dollar interest rate moves that have already been realized and changes in citis balance sheet at progressively higher interest rate levels the marginal net interest income benefit is lower as citi assumes it will pass on a larger share of rate changes to depositors ie higher betas further reducing citis ire sensitivity currencyspecific interest rate changes and balance sheet factors may drive quartertoquarter volatility in citis estimated ire in a bps upward rate shock scenario citi expects that the approximate billion initial negative impact to aoci could potentially be offset in shareholders equity through the expected recovery of the impact on aoci through accretion of citis investment portfolio and expected net interest income benefit over a period of approximately four months scenario analysis the following table presents the estimated impact to citis net interest income aoci and the cet1 capital ratio on a fully implemented basis under five different scenarios of changes in interest rate for the us dollar and all other currencies in which citi has invested capital as of december the bps downward rate scenarios are impacted by the low level of interest rates in several countries and the assumption that market interest rates as well as rates paid to depositors and charged to borrowers do not fall below zero ie the flooring assumption the rate scenarios are also impacted by convexity related to mortgage products in millions of dollars except as otherwise noted scenario scenario scenario scenario scenario overnight rate

scenario assumes that the rate change will occur instantaneously changes in interest rates for maturities between the overnight rate and the 10year rate are interpolated includes the effect of changes in interest rates on aoci related to investment securities cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments as shown in the table above the estimated impact to citis net interest income remains larger under scenario than scenario as citis banking book has relatively higher interest rate exposure to the short end of the yield curve for us dollars exposure to downward rate shocks is larger in magnitude than to upward rate shocks this is because of the lower benefit to net interest income from citis deposit base at higher rate levels as well as the prepayment effects on mortgage loans and mortgagebacked securities for other currencies exposure to downward rate shocks is smaller in magnitude as a result of citis flooring assumption given low rate levels for certain nonus dollar currencies the magnitude of the impact to aoci is greater under scenario as compared to scenario this is because the combination of changes to citis investment portfolio partially offset by changes related to citis pension liabilities results in a net position that is more sensitive to rates at shorter and intermediateterm maturities changes in foreign exchange ratesimpacts on aoci and capital as of december citi estimates that an unanticipated parallel instantaneous appreciation of the us dollar against all of the other currencies in which citi has invested capital could reduce citis tangible common equity tce by approximately billion or as a result of changes to citis cta in aoci net of hedges this impact would be primarily due to changes in the value of the mexican peso euro singapore dollar and indian rupee this impact is also before any mitigating actions citi may take including ongoing management of its foreign currency translation exposure specifically as currency movements change the value of citis net investments in foreign currency denominated capital these movements also change the value of citis riskweighted assets denominated in those currencies this coupled with citis foreign currency hedging strategies such as foreign currency borrowings foreign currency forwards and other currency hedging instruments lessens the impact of foreign currency movements on citis cet1 capital ratio changes in these hedging strategies as well as hedging costs divestitures and tax impacts can further affect the actual impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on citis capital as compared to an unanticipated parallel shock as described above the effect of citis ongoing management strategies with respect to quarterly changes in foreign exchange rates and the quarterly impact of these changes on citis tce and cet1 capital ratio are shown in the table below see note for additional information on the changes in aoci in millions of dollars except as

limited for all material risks taken in the trading portfolios value at risk var var estimates at a confidence level the potential decline in the value of a position or a portfolio under normal market conditions assuming a oneday holding period var statistics which are based on historical data can be materially different across firms due to differences in portfolio composition var methodologies and model parameters as a result citi believes var statistics can be used more effectively as indicators of trends in risktaking within a firm rather than as a basis for inferring differences in risktaking across firms citi uses a single independently approved monte carlo simulation var model see var model review and validation below which has been designed to capture material risk sensitivities such as first and secondorder sensitivities of positions to changes in market prices of various asset classesrisk types such as interest rate credit spread foreign exchange equity and commodity risks citis var includes positions that are measured at fair value it does not include investment securities classified as afs or htm see note for information on these securities citi believes its var model is conservatively calibrated to incorporate fattail scaling and the greater of shortterm approximately the most recent month and longterm months for commodities and three years for others market volatility the monte carlo simulation involves approximately market factors making use of approximately time series with sensitivities updated daily volatility parameters updated intramonthly and correlation parameters updated monthly the conservative features of the var calibration contribute an approximate addon to what would be a var estimated under the assumption of stable and perfectly normally distributed markets as presented in the table below citis average trading var increased million from to mainly due to increased market volatility citis average trading and credit portfolio var increased million from to in line with trading var yearend and average trading var and trading and credit portfolio var in millions of dollars interest rate credit spread

trading and credit portfolio var december average december average covariance adjustment also known as diversification benefit equals the difference between the total var and the sum of the vars tied to each risk type the benefit reflects the fact that the risks within individual and across risk types are not perfectly correlated and consequently the total var on a given day will be lower than the sum of the vars relating to each risk type the determination of the primary drivers of changes to the covariance adjustment is made by an examination of the impact of both model parameter and position changes the total trading var includes marktomarket and certain fair value option trading positions in icg with the exception of hedges to the loan portfolio fair value option loans and all cva exposures availableforsale and accrual exposures are not included the specific riskonly component represents the level of equity and fixed income issuerspecific risk embedded in var the credit

validation generally citis var review and model validation process entails reviewing the model framework major assumptions and implementation of the mathematical algorithm in addition productspecific backtesting on portfolios is periodically completed as part of the ongoing model performance monitoring process and reviewed with citis us banking regulators furthermore regulatory var back testing as described below is performed against buyand hold profit and loss on a monthly basis for multiple sub portfolios across the organization trading desk level icg operating segment and citigroup and the results are shared with us banking regulators material var model and assumption changes must be independently validated within citis independent risk management organization all model changes including those for the var model are validated by the model validation group within citis model risk management in the event of significant model changes parallel model runs are undertaken prior to implementation in addition significant model and assumption changes are subject to the periodic reviews and approval by citis us banking regulators citi uses the same independently validated var model for both regulatory var and risk management var ie total trading and total trading and credit portfolios vars and as such the model review and validation process for both purposes is as described above regulatory var which is calculated in accordance with basel iii differs from risk management var due to the fact that certain positions included in risk management var are not eligible for market risk treatment in regulatory var the composition of risk management var is discussed under value at risk above the applicability of the var model for positions eligible for market risk treatment under us regulatory capital rules is periodically reviewed and approved by citis us banking regulators in accordance with basel iii regulatory var includes all trading bookcovered positions and all foreign exchange and commodity exposures pursuant to basel iii regulatory var excludes positions that fail to meet the intent and ability to trade requirements and are therefore classified as non trading book and categories of exposures that are specifically excluded as covered positions regulatory var excludes cva on derivative instruments and dva on citis own fair value option liabilities cva hedges are excluded from regulatory var and included in credit riskweighted assets as computed under the advanced approaches for determining riskweighted assets regulatory var backtesting in accordance with basel iii citi is required to perform back testing to evaluate the effectiveness of its regulatory var model regulatory var backtesting is the process in which the daily oneday var at a confidence interval is compared to the buyandhold profit and loss ie the profit and loss impact if the portfolio is held constant at the end of the day and repriced the following day buyandhold profit and loss represents the daily marktomarket profit and loss attributable to price movements in covered positions from the close of the previous business day buyandhold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue net interest fees and commissions intraday trading profit and loss and changes in reserves based on a confidence level citi would expect two to three days in any one year where buyandhold losses exceed the regulatory var given the conservative calibration of citis var model as a result of taking the greater of short and longterm volatilities and fattail scaling of volatilities citi would expect fewer exceptions under normal and stable market conditions periods of unstable market conditions could increase the number of backtesting exceptions the following graph shows the daily buyandhold profit and loss associated with citis covered positions compared to citis oneday regulatory var during during one backtesting exception was observed at the citigroup level the difference between the of days with buyand hold gains for regulatory var backtesting and the of days with trading net interest and other revenue associated with citis trading businesses shown in the histogram of daily tradingrelated revenue below reflects among other things that a significant portion of citis tradingrelated revenue is not generated from daily price movements on these positions and exposures as well as differences in the portfolio composition of regulatory var and risk management var regulatory trading var and associated buyandhold profit and loss112 months ended december in millions of dollars total regulatory var buyandhold pl regulatory var t1 buyandhold profit and loss as defined by the banking regulators under basel iii represents the daily marktomarket revenue movement attributable to the trading position from the close of the previous business day buyandhold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue and net interest intraday trading profit and loss on new and terminated trades as well as changes in reserves therefore it is not comparable to the tradingrelated revenue presented in the chart of daily tradingrelated revenue above stress testing citi performs market risk stress testing on a regular basis to estimate the impact of extreme market movements it is performed on individual positions and trading portfolios as well as in aggregate inclusive of multiple trading portfolios citis market risk management after consultations with the businesses develops both systemic and specific stress scenarios reviews the output of periodic stress testing exercises and uses the information to assess the ongoing appropriateness of exposure levels and limits citi uses two complementary approaches to market risk stress testing across all major risk factors ie equity foreign exchange commodity interest rate and credit spreads topdown systemic stresses and bottomup businessspecific stresses systemic stresses are designed to quantify the potential impact of extreme market movements on an institutionwide basis and are constructed using both historical periods of market stress and projections of adverse economic scenarios businessspecific stresses are designed to probe the risks of particular portfolios and market segments especially those risks that are not fully captured in var and systemic stresses the systemic stress scenarios and businessspecific stress scenarios at citi are used in several reports reviewed by senior management and also to calculate internal risk capital for trading market risk in general changes in market values are defined over a oneyear horizon for the most liquid positions and market factors changes in market values are defined over a shorter twomonth horizon the limited set of positions and market factors whose market value changes are defined over a twomonth horizon are those that in managements judgment have historically remained very liquid during financial crises even as the trading liquidity of most other positions and market factors materially declined operational risk overview operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems including human error or misjudgment or from external events this includes legal risk which is the risk of loss including litigation costs settlements and regulatory fines resulting from the failure of citi to comply with laws regulations prudent ethical standards and contractual obligations in any aspect of its businesses but excludes strategic and reputation risks citi also recognizes the impact of operational risk on the reputation risk associated with citis business activities operational risk is inherent in citis global business activities as well as related support functions and can result in losses citi maintains a comprehensive companywide risk taxonomy to classify operational risks that it faces using standardized definitions across citis operational risk management framework see discussion below this taxonomy also supports regulatory requirements and expectations inclusive of those related to us basel iii comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar heightened standards for large financial institutions and doddfrank act stress testing dfast citi manages operational risk consistent with the overall framework described in managing global riskoverview above citis goal is to keep operational risk at appropriate levels relative to the characteristics of its businesses the markets in which it operates its capital and liquidity and the competitive economic and regulatory environment this includes effectively managing operational risk and maintaining or reducing operational risk exposures within citis operational risk appetite citis independent operational risk management group has established a global operational risk management framework with policies and practices for identification measurement monitoring managing and reporting operational risks and the overall operating effectiveness of the internal control environment as part of this framework citi has defined its operational risk appetite and established a managers control assessment mca process for self identification of significant operational risks assessment of the performance of key controls and mitigation of residual risk above acceptable levels each citi operating segment must implement operational risk processes consistent with the requirements of this framework this includes understanding the operational risks they are exposed to designing controls to mitigate identified risks establishing key indicators monitoring and reporting whether the operational risk exposures are in or out of their operational risk appetite having processes in place to bring operational risk exposures within acceptable levels periodically estimating and aggregating the operational risks they are exposed to and ensuring that sufficient resources are available to actively improve the operational risk environment and mitigate emerging risks citi considers operational risks that result from the introduction of new or changes to existing products or result from significant changes in its organizational structures systems processes and personnel citi has a governance structure for the oversight of operational risk exposures through business risk and controls committees brccs which include a citigroup global brcc as well as business functions regional and country brccs brccs provide escalation channels for senior management to review operational risk exposures including breaches of operational risk appetite key indicators operational risk events and control issues membership includes senior business and functions leadership as well as members of the second line of defense in addition independent risk management including the operational risk management group works proactively with citis businesses and functions to drive a strong and embedded operational risk management culture and framework across citi the operational risk management group actively challenges business and functions implementation of the operational risk management framework requirements and the quality of operational risk management practices and outcomes information about businesses key operational risks historical operational risk losses and the control environment is reported by each major business segment and functional area citis operational risk profile and related information is summarized and reported to senior management as well as to the audit and risk committees of citis board of directors by the head of operational risk management operational risk is measured through operational risk capital and operational risk regulatory

failure to protect citis most vital business information assets or operations resulting in a financial or reputational loss for additional information see the operational processes and systems and cybersecurity risk factors in risk factors operational risks above with an evolving threat landscape everincreasing sophistication of threat actor tactics techniques and procedures and use of new technologies to conduct financial transactions citi and its clients customers and third parties are and will continue to be at risk from cyberattacks and information security incidents citi recognizes the significance of these risks and therefore leverages a threatfocused strategy to protect against detect and respond to and recover from cyberattacks further citi actively participates in financial industry government and crosssector knowledgesharing groups to enhance individual and collective cybersecurity preparedness and resilience risk management citis technology and cybersecurity risk management program is built on three lines of defense citis first line of defense under the office of the chief information security officer provides frontline business operational and technical controls and capabilities to protect against cybersecurity risks and to respond to cyber incidents and data breaches citi manages these threats through stateoftheart fusion centers which serve as central commands for monitoring and coordinating responses to cyber threats the enterprise information security team is responsible for infrastructure defense and security controls performing vulnerability assessments and thirdparty information security assessments employee awareness and training programs and security incident management in each case the team works in coordination with a network of information security officers who are embedded within the businesses and functions globally citis operational risk managementtechnology and cyber ormtc and independent compliance risk managementtechnology and information security icrmt groups serve as the second line of defense and actively evaluate anticipate and challenge citis risk mitigation practices and capabilities citi seeks to proactively identify and remediate technology and cybersecurity risks before they materialize as incidents that negatively affect business operations accordingly the ormtc team independently challenges and monitors capabilities in accordance with citis defined technology and cyber risk appetite statements to address evolving cybersecurity risks and corresponding regulations ormtc and icrmt teams collectively also monitor cyber legal and regulatory requirements identify and define emerging risks execute strategic cyber threat assessments perform new products and initiative reviews perform data management risk oversight and conduct cyber risk assurance reviews inclusive of thirdparty assessments in addition ormtc employs tools and oversees and challenges metrics that are both tailored to cybersecurity and technology and aligned with citis overall operational risk management framework to effectively track identify and manage risk internal audit serves as the third line of defense and independently provides assurance on how effectively the organization as a whole manages cybersecurity risk citi also has multiple senior committees such as the information security risk committee isrc which governs enterprise level risk tolerance inclusive of cybersecurity risk board oversight citis board of directors andor one or more board committees provides oversight of managements efforts to mitigate cybersecurity risk and respond to cyber incidents the board andor one or more board committees receives regular reports on cybersecurity and engages in discussions throughout the year with management and subjectmatter experts on the effectiveness of citis overall cybersecurity program the board andor one or more board committees also obtains updates on citis inherent cybersecurity risks and citis road map and progress for addressing these risks moreover citis board and its committee members receive contemporaneous reporting on significant cyber events including response legal obligations and outreach and notification to regulators and customers when needed as well as guidance to management as appropriate on an annual basis the boards risk management committee approved a standalone cybersecurity risk appetite statement against which citis performance is measured quarterly for additional information on the boards oversight of cybersecurity risk management see citis upcoming proxy statement to be filed with the sec in march compliance risk compliance risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from violations of laws rules or regulations or from nonconformance with prescribed practices internal policies and procedures or ethical standards compliance risk exposes citi to fines civil money penalties payment of damages and the voiding of contracts compliance risk can result in diminished reputation harm to citis customers limited business opportunities and lessened expansion potential it encompasses the risk of noncompliance with all laws and regulations as well as prudent ethical standards and some contractual obligations it could also include exposure to litigation known as legal risk from all aspects of traditional and nontraditional banking citi seeks to operate with integrity maintain strong ethical standards and adhere to applicable policies and regulatory and legal requirements citi must maintain and execute a proactive compliance risk management crm framework as set forth in the crm policy that is designed to manage compliance risk effectively across citi with a view to fundamentally strengthen the compliance risk management culture across the lines of defense taking into account citis risk governance framework and regulatory requirements independent compliance risk managements icrm primary objectives are to drive and embed a culture of compliance and control throughout citi maintain and oversee an integrated crm framework that facilitates enterprisewide compliance with local national or crossborder laws rules or regulations citis internal policies standards and procedures and relevant standards of conduct assess compliance risks and issues across product lines functions and geographies supported by globally consistent systems and compliance risk management processes and provide compliance risk data aggregation and reporting capabilities citi carries out its objectives and fulfills its responsibilities through the crm framework which is composed of the following integrated key activities to holistically manage compliance risk management of citis compliance with laws rules and regulations by identifying and analyzing changes assessing the impact and implementing appropriate policies processes and controls developing and providing compliance training to ensure colleagues are aware of and understand the key laws rules and regulations monitoring the compliance risk appetite which is articulated through qualitative compliance risk statements describing citis appetite for certain types of risk and quantitative measures to monitor the companys compliance risk exposure executing compliance risk assessments the results of which inform compliance risk monitoring and testing of compliance risks and controls in assessing conformance with laws rules regulations and internal policies and issue identification escalation and remediation to drive accountability including measurement and reporting of compliance risk metrics against established thresholds in support of the crm policy and compliance risk appetite to anticipate control and mitigate compliance risk citi has established the crm policy to achieve standardization and centralization of methodologies and processes and to enable more consistent and comprehensive execution of compliance risk management citi has a commitment as well as an obligation to identify assess and mitigate compliance risks associated with its businesses and functions icrm is responsible for oversight of citis crm policy while all businesses and global control functions are responsible for managing their compliance risks and operating within the compliance risk appetite as discussed above citi is working to address the frb and occ consent orders which include improvements to citis crm framework and its enterprisewide application for additional information regarding the consent orders see citis consent order compliance above reputation risk citis reputation is a vital asset in building trust and citi is diligent in enhancing and protecting its reputation with its key stakeholders to support this citi has developed a reputation risk framework under this framework citigroup and citibank na have implemented a risk appetite statement and related key indicators to monitor corporate activities and operations relative to citis risk appetite the framework also requires that business segments and regions escalate potential material reputation risks that require review or mitigation through a reputation risk committee or equivalent the reputation risk committees which are composed of citis senior executives govern the process by which material reputation risks are identified measured monitored controlled and reported the reputation risk committees determine the appropriate actions to be taken in line with risk appetite and regulatory expectations while promoting a culture of risk awareness and high standards of integrity and ethical behavior across the company consistent with citis mission and value proposition the citigroup reputation risk committee may escalate reputation risks to the nomination governance and public affairs committee or other appropriate committee of the citigroup board of directors every citi employee is responsible for safeguarding citis reputation guided by citis code of conduct colleagues are expected to exercise sound judgment and common sense in decisions and actions they are also expected to promptly escalate all issues that present material reputation risk in line with policy strategic risk as discussed above strategic risk is the risk of a sustained impact not episodic impact to citis core strategic objectives as measured by impacts on anticipated earnings market capitalization or capital arising from external factors affecting the companys operating environment as well as the risks associated with defining the strategy and executing the strategy which are identified measured and managed as part of the strategic risk framework at the enterprise level in this context external factors affecting citis operating environment are the economic environment geopolitical political landscape industrycompetitive landscape societal trends customerclient behavior regulatorylegislative environment and trends related to investorsshareholders citis executive management team is responsible for the development and execution of citis strategy this strategy is translated into forwardlooking plans collectively citis strategic plan that are then cascaded across the organization citis strategic plan is presented to the board on an annual basis and is aligned with risk appetite thresholds and includes a risk assessment as required by internal frameworks it is also aligned with limit requirements for capital allocation governance and oversight of strategic risk is facilitated by internal committees on a groupwide basis as well as strategic committees at the operating segment and regional levels citi works to ensure that strategic risks are adequately considered and addressed across its various risk management activities and that strategic risks are assessed in the context of citis risk appetite citi conducts a topdown bottomup risk identification process to identify risks including strategic risks business segments undertake a quarterly risk identification process to systematically identify and document all material risks faced by citi independent risk management oversees the risk identification process through regular reviews and coordinates identification and monitoring of top risks in addition citi performs a quarterly risk assessment of the plan raop and continuously monitors risks associated with its execution of strategy independent risk management also manages strategic risk by monitoring risk appetite thresholds in conjunction with various strategic risk committees which are part of the governance structure that citi has in place to manage its strategic risks for additional information on citis strategic risks see risk factorsstrategic risks above climate risk climate change presents immediate and longterm risks to citi and its clients and customers with the risks expected to increase over time climate risk refers to the risk of loss arising from climate change and comprises both physical risk and transition risk physical risk considers how chronic and acute climate change eg increased storms drought fires floods can directly damage physical assets eg real estate crops or otherwise impact their value or productivity transition risk considers how changes in policy technology business practices and market preferences to address climate change eg carbon pricing policies power generation shifts from fossil fuels to renewable energy can lead to changes in the value of assets commodities and companies sustainable finance and actively engage with regulators on these topics for additional information about sustainability and other esg matters at citi see sustainability and other esg matters above climate risk is an overarching risk that can act as a driver other risks of other categories of risk such as credit risk from obligors exposed to high climate risk strategic risks if citi fails to consider transition risk in client selection reputational risk from increased stakeholder concerns about financing high carbon industries and operational risk from physical risks to citis facilities and personnel citis focus on climate risk continues to increase driven by materiality of strategic reputational and financial risk considerations citi continues to make progress toward embedding these considerations into its overarching risk management approach for additional information on climate risk see risk factorsstrategic risks above citi reviews factors related to climate risk under its environmental and social risk management esrm policy which includes a focus on climate risk related to financed projects and clients in highcarbon sectors considering the credit risk of stranded assets as well as the reputational risks associated with the coal sector due to its highcarbon emissions citis esrm policy includes a prohibition on all projectrelated financing of new coalfired power plants and new or expanding thermal coal mines as well as timetables to reduce financing of companies with high exposure to coal fired power and coal mining that do not pursue lowcarbon transition in the coming years these sector approaches set clear expectations for clients and help address certain climate riskdriven credit risk concerns while reducing reputation risk citi continues to explore and test methodologies for quantifying how climate risks could impact the individual credit profiles of its clients across various sectors to assist in embedding climate risk assessments in its credit assessment process citi has developed sectorspecific climate risk assessments such climate risk assessments are designed to supplement publicly available client disclosures and data provided from thirdparty vendors and facilitate conversations with clients on their most material climate risks and management plans for adaptation and mitigation citis assessments consider sectors that have been identified as higher climate risk by its risk identification process this will help citi better understand its clients businesses and climate related risks citis net zero plan is leading to the further integration of climate risk discussions into client engagement and client selection citi continues to develop globally consistent principles and approaches for managing climate risk across the company through the implementation of its climate risk management framework through this implementation climate risk is being embedded into relevant policies and processes over time furthermore citi continues to participate in financial industry initiatives and develop and pilot new methodologies and approaches for measuring and assessing the potential financial risks of climate change citi also continues to monitor regulatory developments on climate risk and libor transition risk as previously disclosed the libor administrator ceased publication of nonusd libor and oneweek and twomonth usd libor on a permanent or representative basis on december with plans for all other usd libor tenors to permanently cease or become nonrepresentative after june as a result citi ceased entering into new contracts referencing usd libor as of january other than for limited circumstances where regulators recognized that it may be appropriate for banks to enter into new usd libor contracts including with respect to market making hedging or novations of usd transactions executed before january for information about risks to citi from a transition away from and discontinuation of libor or any other benchmark rates see risk factorsother risks above during citi continued its efforts to manage its libor transition risks citi has been focused on further reducing its libor exposure and remediating its remaining outstanding liborlinked contracts in addition citi has continued to monitor and engage on legislative regulatory and other initiatives and developments related to libor transition matters as of december citi had a usd liborlinked gross notional exposure of approximately trillion that matures after the libor cessation date of june of which approximately trillion relates to derivatives this derivatives exposure includes i bilateral derivatives with a gross notional of approximately trillion of which is already remediated through inclusion of isda fallbacks and ii cleared derivatives with a gross notional of approximately trillion that will be covered by the central counterparty clearing house ccp conversions planned for the second quarter of the remaining gross notional of approximately trillion relates to cash products eg loans debt securities preferred stock and securitizations which citi continues to address through active conversion or insertion of robust contract fallback language or is covered by legislative solutions such as the adjustable interest rate libor act see the discussion below due to rounding usd libor linked derivatives and cash products exposure may not sum to total usd liborlinked gross notional exposure in the us the libor act provides for the use of a statutory replacement for the overnight onemonth three month sixmonth and 12month tenors of usd libor in all contracts governed by us law that lack adequate fallback provisions as required by the libor act each proposed replacement rate which differs depending on product type is based on the secured overnight financing rate sofr citis usd liborlinked securities and contracts that do not have adequate fallbacks as described in the libor act and that are governed by us law will fall within the application of the libor act as a result usd libor in these contracts will be replaced with sofr plus the applicable spread adjustment citi is focused on remediating contracts that reference the usd libor ice swap rate and nonus law contracts which are not covered by the libor act as of december citi had a usd libor ice swap rate gross notional exposure of approximately trillion this includes approximately trillion of bilateral derivatives of which has already been remediated through inclusion of isda fallbacks and approximately trillion of debt securities that citi is addressing through its remediation action plans the usd libor ice swap rate is a separate rate from usd libor and is not included in the usd liborlinked gross notional exposure on november the fca proposed the publication of one three and sixmonth usd libor on a synthetic basis through september which would provide additional time for nonuslawgoverned contracts and any contracts that reference the usd libor ice swap rate to be remediated or mature further citi continued to engage with regulators financial accounting bodies and others on libor transition matters this included participating in a number of working groups including the alternative reference rates committee arrc convened by the frb to promote and advance development of sofr and seek to identify and address potential challenges from libor transition citi has also continued to use alternative reference rates in certain newly issued financial instruments citi has issued floating rate benchmark and customerrelated debt linked to sofr and originated and arranged loans linked to sofr citis derivatives contracts are predominantly linked to sofr and other global alternative reference rates citi also provides term sofrlinked products to clients in accordance with industry best practices and recommendations country

the cta loss is not held in ao citibank and would be recognized in citigroups earnings upon either the substantial liquidation or a loss of control of ao citibank citi has separately described these risks in deconsolidation risk below during the fourth quarter of citi continued to reduce its operations in russia and russiarelated exposures resulting in a net decrease in total russia exposure of billion shown in the table above as well as a change in the composition of its exposure as mitigation efforts have reduced citis thirdparty credit risk the sequential decline in exposure was driven by a billion decrease due to depreciation of the ruble against the us dollar and a billion decrease due to loan repayments and sales partially offset by a billion increase in local currency terms driven by dividends received by citi as custodian for investor clients in russia that citi is unable to remit due to restrictions imposed by the russian government citis continued risk mitigation efforts include icg borrower paydowns and limiting extensions of new credit icgs credit exposure also reflected a shift to a higher proportion of stronger credit names including a higher proportion of subsidiaries of multinational companies that are headquartered outside of russia primarily in the us and europe the decline in overall exposure was also driven by a reduction in exposures to russian counterparties not held by ao citibank citis net investment in russia was approximately billion as of december compared to billion as of september the decrease was primarily driven by a billion decrease due to depreciation of the ruble against the us dollar partially offset by an increase of billion in retained earnings a portion of citis net investment was hedged for foreign currency

portfolio sales of costs in in october citi announced that it will be ending nearly all of the institutional banking services it offers in russia by the end of the first quarter of going forward citis only operations in russia will be those necessary to fulfill its remaining legal and regulatory obligations on october citi entered into an agreement to sell a portfolio of rubledenominated personal installment loans totaling approximately million in outstanding loan balances as of the fourth quarter of to uralsib a russian commercial bank citi closed the sale in december and incurred a pretax net loss of approximately million as a result in connection with the portfolio sale citi also entered into a referral agreement to settle to uralsib a portfolio of rubledenominated credit card loans subject to customer consents the outstanding card loans balance was approximately million as of the fourth quarter of citi will refer credit card customers who at the customers sole discretion will be eligible to refinance their outstanding card loan balances with uralsib at this time citi expects to incur estimated costs of approximately million in connection with its consumer and institutional winddown plans in russia primarily through million in icg and million in legacy franchises for additional information see institutional clients group and legacy franchises above deconsolidation risk citis operations in russia subject it to various risks including among others foreign currency volatility including appreciations or devaluations restrictions arising from retaliatory russian laws and regulations on the conduct of its business sanctions or asset freezes or other deconsolidation events for additional information see risk factorsother risks above examples of triggers that may result in deconsolidation of ao citibank include voluntary or forced sale of ownership or loss of control due to actions of relevant governmental authorities including expropriation ie the entity becomes subject to the complete control of a government court administrator trustee or regulator revocation of banking license and loss of ability to elect a board of directors or appoint members of senior management as of december citi continued to consolidate ao citibank because none of the deconsolidation factors were triggered in the event of a loss of control of ao citibank citi would be required to i write off the net investment of approximately billion compared to billion as of september ii recognize a cta loss of approximately billion through earnings compared to billion as of september and iii recognize a loss of billion compared to billion as of september on intercompany liabilities owed by ao citibank to other citi entities outside russia in the sole event of a substantial liquidation as opposed to a loss of control citi would be required to recognize the cta loss of approximately billion through earnings and would evaluate its remaining net investment as circumstances evolve citi as paying agent for russianrelated clients citi serves or served as paying agent on bonds issued by various entities in russia including russian corporate clients citis role as paying agent is administrative in this role citi acts as an agent of its client the bond issuer receiving interest and principal payments from the bond issuer and then making payments to international central securities depositories eg depository trust company euroclear clearstream the international central securities depositories icsds make payments to those participants or account holders eg broker in the country cessation of new business and client originations and reduction of other exposures citis continued presence or divestiture of businesses in russia could also increase its susceptibility to cyberattacks that could negatively impact its relationships with clients and customers harm its reputation increase its compliance costs and adversely affect its business operations and results of operations for additional information on operational and cyber risks see risk factorsoperational risk above boards role in overseeing related risks the citi board of directors board and the boards risk management committee rmc and its other committees have received and continue to receive regular reports from senior management regarding the war in ukraine and its impact on citis operations in russia ukraine and elsewhere as well as the wars broader geopolitical macroeconomic and reputational impacts in addition to receiving regular briefings from management the full board has routinely been invited to attend portions of the rmc meetings for discussions related to the war in ukraine including with respect to citis risk exposures and stress testing the reports to the board and its committees from senior management who represent the impacted businesses and the emea region independent risk management finance independent compliance risk management including those individuals responsible for sanctions compliance and human resources have included detailed information regarding financial impacts impacts on capital cybersecurity strategic considerations sanctions compliance employee assistance and reputational risks enabling the board and its committees to properly exercise their oversight responsibilities in addition senior management has also provided updates to citis executive management team and the board outside of formal meetings regarding citis russiarelated risks including with respect to cybersecurity matters dealers that have clients who are investors in the applicable bonds ie bondholders as a paying agent citi generally does not have information about the identity of the bondholders citi may be exposed to risks due to its responsibilities for receiving and processing payments on behalf of its clients as a result of sanctions or other governmental requirements and prohibitions to mitigate operational and sanctions risks citi has established policies procedures and controls for client relationships and payment processing to help ensure compliance with us uk eu and other jurisdictions sanctions laws these processes may require citi to delay or withhold the processing of payments as a result of sanctions on the bond issuer citi is also prevented from making payments to accounts on behalf of bondholders should the icsds disclose to citi the presence of sanctioned bondholders in both instances citi is generally required to segregate restrict or block the funds until applicable sanctions are lifted or the payment is otherwise authorized under applicable law reputational risks citi has continued its efforts to enhance and protect its reputation with its colleagues clients customers investors regulators and the public citis response to the war in ukraine including any action or inaction may have a negative impact on citis reputation with some or all of these parties for example citi is exposed to reputational risk as a result of its current presence in russia and association with russian individuals or entities whether subject to sanctions or not including citis inability to support its global clients in russia which could adversely affect its broader client relationships and businesses current involvement in transactions or supporting activities involving russian assets or interests failure to correctly interpret and apply laws and regulations including those related to sanctions perceived misalignment of citis actions to its stated strategy in russia and the reputational impact from citis activity and engagement with ukraine or with nonrussian clients exiting their russia businesses citi has considered the potential for reputation risk and taken actions to mitigate such risks citi established a russia special review process with managements reputation risk committee with oversight for significant russiarelated reputation risks and completed a number of reputation risk reviews of matters with a russian nexus while citi announced its intention to wind down its businesses in russia citi will continue to manage those operations during the winddown process and will be required to maintain certain limited operations to fulfill its remaining legal and regulatory obligations also sanctions and sanctions compliance are highly complex and may change over time and result in increased operational risk failure to fully comply with relevant sanctions or the application of sanctions where they should not be applied may negatively impact citis reputation in addition citi currently performs services for conducts business with or deals in nonsanctioned russian owned businesses and russian assets this has attracted and will likely continue to attract negative attention despite the previously disclosed plan to wind down nearly all its activities ukraine citi has continued to operate in ukraine throughout the war through its icg businesses serving the local subsidiaries of multinationals along with local financial institutions and the public sector citi employs approximately people in ukraine and their safety is citis top priority all of citis domestic operations in ukraine are conducted through a subsidiary of citibank which uses the ukrainian hryvnia as its functional currency citis exposures in ukraine are not significant enough to be included in the top country exposures table above as of december these exposures amounted to billion unchanged from september and were exclusively composed of thirdparty assets held on the citi ukraine subsidiary argentina citi operates in argentina through its icg businesses as of december citis net investment in its argentine operations was approximately billion under us gaap citi uses the us dollar as the functional currency for its operations in countries that are deemed highly inflationary citi uses argentinas official market exchange rate to remeasure its net argentine pesodenominated assets into the us dollar as of december the official argentine peso exchange rate against the us dollar was as previously disclosed the central bank of argentina has continued to maintain certain capital and currency controls that restrict citis ability to access us dollars in argentina and remit earnings from its argentine operations as a result citis net investment in its argentine operations is likely to continue to increase as citi generates net income in its argentine franchise and its earnings cannot be remitted due to the currency controls implemented by the central bank of argentina certain indirect foreign exchange mechanisms have developed that some argentine entities may use to obtain us dollars generally at rates that are significantly higher than argentinas official exchange rate citibank argentina is precluded from accessing these alternative mechanisms and these exchange mechanisms cannot be used to remeasure citis net monetary assets into the us dollar under us gaap however if argentinas official exchange rate converges with the approximate rate implied by the indirect foreign exchange mechanisms citi could incur a loss on its capital in argentina citi cannot predict future fluctuations in argentinas official market exchange rate or to what extent citi may be able to access us dollars at the official exchange rate in the future citi economically hedges the foreign currency risk in its net argentine pesodenominated assets to the extent possible and prudent using nondeliverable forward ndf derivative instruments that are primarily executed outside of argentina as of december the international ndf market had very limited liquidity resulting in citis inability to economically hedge its argentine peso exposure accordingly and to the extent that citi does not execute ndf contracts for this unhedged exposure in the future citi would record devaluations on its net argentine pesodenominated assets in earnings without any benefit from a change in the fair value of derivative positions used to economically hedge the exposure citi continually evaluates its economic exposure to its argentine counterparties and reserves for changes in credit risk and records marktomarket adjustments for relevant market risks associated with its argentine assets citi believes it has established an appropriate acl on its argentine loans and appropriate fair value adjustments on argentine assets and liabilities measured at fair value for credit and sovereign risks under us gaap as of december however us regulatory agencies may require citi to record additional reserves in the future increasing icgs cost of credit based on the perceived country risk associated with its argentine exposures for additional information on citis emerging markets risks including those related to its argentine exposures see risk factors above ffieccrossborder claims on third parties and local country assets citis crossborder disclosures are presented below based on the country exposure bank regulatory reporting guidelines of the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec the following summarizes some of the key ffiec reporting guidelines amounts are based on the domicile of the ultimate obligor counterparty collateral only including qualifying liquid collateral issuer or guarantor as applicable eg a security recorded by a citi us entity but issued by the uk government is considered uk exposure a loan recorded by a citi mexico entity to a customer domiciled in mexico where the underlying collateral is held in germany is considered german exposure amounts do not consider the benefit of collateral received for secured financing transactions ie repurchase agreements reverse repurchase agreements and securities loaned and borrowed and are reported based on notional amounts netting of derivative receivables and payables reported at fair value is permitted but only under a legally binding netting agreement with the same specific counterparty and does not include the benefit of margin received or hedges credit default swaps cds are included based on the gross notional amount sold and purchased and do not include any offsetting cds on the same underlying entity loans are reported without the benefit of hedges given the requirements noted above citis ffiec cross border exposures and total outstandings tend to fluctuate in some cases significantly from period to period as an example because total outstandings under ffiec guidelines do not include the benefit of margin or hedges market volatility in interest rates foreign exchange
