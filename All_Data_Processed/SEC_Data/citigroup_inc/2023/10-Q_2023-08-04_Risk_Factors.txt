certain citibank entities citibank could reduce the funding and liquidity risk if any of the potential downgrades described above through mitigating actions including repricing or reducing certain commitments to commercial paper conduits in the event of the potential downgrades described above citi believes that certain corporate customers could reevaluate their deposit relationships with citibank this reevaluation could result in clients adjusting their discretionary deposit levels or changing their depository institution which could potentially reduce certain deposit levels at citibank however citi could choose to adjust pricing offer alternative deposit products to its existing customers or seek to attract deposits from new customers in addition to the mitigating actions referenced above market risk market risk arises from both citis trading and nontrading portfolios for additional information on market risk and market risk management at citi see market risk overview and risk factors in citis form 10k market risk of nontrading portfolios market risk from nontrading portfolios stems predominantly from the potential impact of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on citis net interest income and on citis accumulated other comprehensive income loss aoci from its investment securities portfolios market risk from nontrading portfolios also includes the potential impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on citis capital invested in foreign currencies banking book interest rate risk for interest rate risk purposes citis nontrading portfolios are referred to as the banking book management of interest rate risk in the banking book is governed by citis nontrading market risk policy managements asset liability committee alco establishes citis risk appetite and related limits for interest rate risk in the banking book which are subject to approval by citigroups board of directors corporate treasury is responsible for the daytoday management of citis banking book interest rate risk as well as periodically reviewing it with the alco citis banking book interest rate risk management is also subject to independent oversight from the second line of defense team reporting to the chief risk officer changes in interest rates impact citis net income aoci and cet1 these changes primarily affect citis banking book through net interest income due to a variety of risk factors including differences in timing and amounts of the maturity or repricing of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments changes in the level andor shape of interest rate curves client behavior in response to changes in interest rates eg mortgage prepayments deposit betas and changes in the maturity of instruments resulting from changes in the interest rate environment as part of their ongoing activities citis businesses generate interest ratesensitive positions from their client facing products such as loans and deposits the component of this interest rate risk that can be hedged is transferred via citis funds transfer pricing process to corporate treasury corporate treasury uses various tools to manage the total interest rate risk position within the established risk appetite and target citis desired risk profile including its investment securities portfolio companyissued debt and interest rate derivatives in addition citi uses multiple metrics to measure its banking book interest rate risk interest rate exposure ire is a key metric that analyzes the impact of a range of scenarios on citis banking book net interest income and certain other interest ratesensitive income versus a base case ire does not represent a forecast of citis net interest income the scenarios methodologies and assumptions used in this analysis are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the market environment changes in citis balance sheet composition enhancements in citis modeling and other factors since the third quarter of citi has employed enhanced ire methodologies and changes to certain assumptions the changes included among other things assumptions around the projected balance sheet and revisions to the treatment of certain business contributions notably accrual positions in icgs markets businesses these changes resulted in a higher impact to citis net interest income over a 12month period under the enhanced methodology citi utilizes the most recent quarterend balance sheet assuming no changes to its composition and size over the forecasted horizon holding the balance sheet static the forecasts incorporate expectations and assumptions of deposit pricing loan spreads and mortgage prepayment behavior implied by the interest rate curves in each scenario the base case scenario reflects the market implied forward interest rates and sensitivity scenarios assume instantaneous shocks to the base case the forecasts do not assume citi takes any riskmitigating actions in response to changes in the interest rate environment certain interest rates are subject to flooring assumptions in downward rate scenarios deposit pricing sensitivities ie deposit betas are informed by historical and expected behavior actual deposit pricing could differ from the assumptions used in these forecasts citis ire analysis primarily reflects the impacts from the following banking book assets and liabilities loans client deposits citis deposits with other banks investment securities longterm debt any related interest rate hedges and the funds transfer pricing of positions in total trading and credit portfolio value at risk var it excludes impacts from any positions that are included in total trading and credit portfolio var in addition to ire citi analyzes economic value sensitivity evs as a longerterm interest rate risk metric evs is a net present value npvbased measure of the lifetime cash flows of citis banking book it estimates the interest rate sensitivity of the banking books economic value from longerterm assets being potentially funded with shorter term liabilities or vice versa citi manages evs within risk limits approved by citigroups board of directors that are aligned with citis interest rate risk appetite interest rate risk of investment portfoliosimpact on aoci citi also measures the potential impacts of changes in interest rates on the value of its aoci which can in turn impact citis common equity and tangible common equity this will impact citis cet1 and other regulatory capital ratios citi seeks to manage its exposure to changes in the market level of interest rates while limiting the potential impact on its aoci and regulatory capital position aoci at risk is managed as part of the companywide interest rate risk position aoci at risk considers potential changes in aoci and the corresponding impact on the cet1 capital ratio relative to citis capital generation capacity citi uses basis point bps shocks in each scenario to reflect its net interest income sensitivity to unanticipated changes in market interest rates as potential monetary policy decisions and changes in economic conditions may be reflected in current market implied

notably the banking book revisions to the treatment of certain business activities includes the effect of changes in interest rates on aoci related to investment securities cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments the all other currencies of million as of june in the table above includes the impact from the following top six nonus dollar currencies which represents nearly of the total nonus dollar currency impact approximately billion from british pound sterling and approximately billion each from japanese yen singapore dollar taiwan dollar indian rupee and swiss franc these impacts per currency are generally in the same direction estimated positive impact in the bps shock scenario and not offsetting citis balance sheet is asset sensitive assets reprice faster than liabilities resulting in higher net interest income in increasing interest rate scenarios the estimated impact to citis net interest income in a bps upward rate shock scenario as of the second quarter of decreased quarter overquarter and yearoveryear primarily due to changes in deposit composition and levels partially offset by hedging actions at progressively higher interest rate levels the marginal net interest income benefit is lower as citi assumes it will pass on a larger share of rate changes to depositors ie higher betas further reducing citis ire sensitivity currencyspecific interest rate changes and balance sheet factors may drive quartertoquarter volatility in citis estimated ire in a bps upward rate shock scenario citi expects that the approximate billion initial negative impact to aoci could potentially be offset in shareholders equity through the expected recovery of the impact on aoci through accretion of citis investment portfolio and expected net interest income benefit over a period of approximately six months scenario analysis the following table presents the estimated impact to citis net interest income aoci and cet1 capital ratio on a fully

the table above assumes no change in deposit size or mix from the baseline forecast included in the different interest scenarios presented as a result in higher interest rate scenarios customer activity resulting in a shift from noninterestbearing and low interest rate deposit products to higher yielding deposits would reduce the expected benefit to net interest income conversely in lower

interest income scenario includes the impact from the following top six nonus dollar currencies which represents nearly of the total nonus dollar currency impact approximately billion from british pound sterling and approximately million each from japanese yen singapore dollar taiwan dollar indian rupee and swiss franc these impacts per currency are generally in the same direction estimated positive impact in the bps shock scenario and not offsetting includes the effect of changes in interest rates on aoci related to investment securities cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments as shown in the table above the estimated impact to citis net interest income is larger under scenario than scenario as citis banking book has relatively higher interest rate exposure to the short end of the yield curve for nonus dollar currencies exposure to downward rate shocks is smaller in magnitude as a result of citis flooring assumption given low rate levels for certain nonus dollar currencies the magnitude of the impact to aoci is greater under scenario compared to scenario this is because the combination of changes to citis investment portfolio partially offset by changes related to citis pension liabilities results in a net position that is more sensitive to rates at shorter and intermediateterm maturities changes in foreign exchange ratesimpacts on aoci and capital as of june citi estimates that an unanticipated parallel instantaneous appreciation of the us dollar against all of the other currencies in which citi has invested capital could reduce citis tangible common equity tce by approximately billion or as a result of changes to citis cta in aoci net of hedges this impact would be primarily due to changes in the value of the mexican peso euro and indian rupee this impact is also before any mitigating actions citi may take including ongoing management of its foreign currency translation exposure specifically as currency movements change the value of citis net investments in foreign currency denominated capital these movements also change the value of citis riskweighted assets denominated in those currencies in millions of dollars except as otherwise noted change in fx spot rate1 change in tce due to fx translation net of hedges as a percentage of tce estimated impact to cet1 capital ratio on a fully implemented basis due to changes

lessens the impact of foreign currency movements on citis cet1 capital ratio changes in these hedging strategies as well as hedging costs divestitures and tax impacts can further affect the actual impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on citis capital compared to an unanticipated parallel shock as described above the effect of citis ongoing management strategies with respect to quarterly

with russian individuals or entities whether subject to sanctions or not including citis inability to support its global clients in russia which could adversely affect its broader client relationships and businesses current involvement in transactions or supporting activities involving russian assets or interests failure to correctly interpret and apply laws and regulations including those related to sanctions perceived misalignment of citis actions to its stated strategy in russia and the reputational impact from citis activity and engagement with ukraine or with nonrussian clients exiting their russia businesses citi has considered the potential for reputation risk and taken actions to mitigate such risks citi established a russia special review process with managements reputation risk committee with oversight for significant russiarelated reputation risks and completed a number of reputation risk reviews of matters with a russian nexus while citi announced its intention to wind down its businesses in russia citi will continue to manage those operations during the winddown process and will be required to maintain certain limited operations to fulfill its remaining legal and regulatory obligations also sanctions and sanctions compliance are highly complex and may change over time and result in increased operational risk failure to fully comply with relevant sanctions or the application of sanctions where they should not be applied may negatively impact citis reputation in addition citi currently performs services for conducts business with or deals in nonsanctioned russian owned businesses and russian assets this has attracted and will likely continue to attract negative attention despite the previously disclosed plan to wind down nearly all its activities in the country cessation of new business and client originations and reduction of other exposures citis continued presence or divestiture of businesses in russia could also increase its susceptibility to

economically hedge the foreign currency risk in its net arsdenominated assets to the extent possible and prudent using nondeliverable forward ndf derivative instruments that are primarily executed outside of argentina as of june the international ndf market had very limited liquidity resulting in citis inability to economically hedge substantially all of its ars exposure accordingly and to the extent that citi does not execute ndf contracts for this unhedged exposure in the future citi would record devaluations on its net arsdenominated assets in earnings without any benefit from a change in the fair value of derivative positions used to economically hedge the exposure citi continually evaluates its economic exposure to its argentine counterparties and reserves for changes in credit risk and records marktomarket adjustments for relevant market risks associated with its argentine assets citi believes it has established an appropriate acl on its argentine loans and appropriate fair value adjustments on argentine assets and liabilities measured at fair value for credit and sovereign risks under us gaap as of june however citi may need to record additional reserves in the future resulting in higher icg cost of credit should there be an increase in transfer risk associated with its argentine exposures for additional information on citis emerging markets risks including those related to its argentine exposures see risk factorsstrategic risks in citis form 10k argentina citi operates in argentina through its icg businesses as of june citis net investment in its argentine operations was approximately billion compared to billion at march under us gaap citi uses the us dollar as the functional currency for its operations in countries such as argentina that are deemed highly inflationary citi therefore records the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on its net argentine peso arsdenominated assets directly in earnings accordingly citi seeks to reduce its overall ars exposure in argentina while complying with local capital and currency exposure limitations as of june citis net ars exposure was approximately billion which decreased from the prior quarter as a result of citi purchasing approximately million of certain local government bonds during the second quarter that are indexed to the higher of the us dollar exchange rate or the local inflation index such bonds may reduce the impact to citi of a potential currency devaluation in the future although it remains unclear how effective citis strategies to reduce its ars exposure may be as previously disclosed the central bank of argentina has continued to maintain certain capital and currency controls that generally restrict citis ability to access us dollars in argentina and remit earnings from its argentine operations as a result citis net investment in its argentine operations is likely to continue to increase as citi generates net income in its argentine franchise and its earnings cannot be remitted due to the currency controls implemented by the central bank of argentina certain indirect foreign exchange mechanisms have developed that some argentine entities may use to obtain us dollars generally at rates that are significantly higher than argentinas official exchange rate citibank argentina is precluded from accessing these alternative mechanisms and these exchange mechanisms cannot be used to remeasure citis net monetary assets into the us dollar under us gaap citibank argentina therefore uses argentinas official market exchange rate to remeasure its net ars assets into the us dollar which was ars to us dollar as of june however if argentinas official exchange rate converges with the approximate rate implied by the indirect foreign exchange mechanisms citi could incur a significant loss on its capital in argentina current macroeconomic conditions in the country along with sustained high inflation and low international reserves held by the central bank of argentina may result in an accelerated or steep depreciation of the official exchange rate in the near term citi cannot predict future fluctuations in argentinas official market exchange rate or to what extent citi may be able to access us dollars at the official exchange rate in the future
