associated with unrecognized tax benefits critical accounting policies and estimates managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the companys consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates and judgments including those related to customers and suppliers allowance for credit losses bad debts investments financing operations longlived assets taxes other contingencies and litigation management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which have formed the basis for making such judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources under different assumptions or conditions actual results may differ from the recorded estimates management believes that the companys critical accounting policies are those relating to the allowance for credit losses and fair value measurements allowance for credit losses the companys acl represents managements judgment of the total expected losses included in the companys assets held at amortized cost the companys process for recording the acl is based on the evaluation of the companys lifetime historical loss experience managements understanding of the credit quality inherent in the loan portfolio and the impact of the current economic environment coupled with reasonable and supportable economic forecasts a mathematical calculation of an estimate is made to assist in determining the adequacy and reasonableness of managements recorded acl to develop the estimate the company follows the guidelines in asc topic financial instruments credit losses the estimate reserves for assets held at amortized cost and any related credit deterioration in the companys availableforsale debt security portfolio assets held at amortized cost include the companys loan book and heldtomaturity security portfolio the process involves the consideration of quantitative and qualitative factors relevant to the specific segmentation of loans these factors have been established over decades of financial institution experience and include economic observation and loan loss characteristics this process is designed to produce a lifetime estimate of the losses at a reporting date that includes evaluation of historical loss experience current economic conditions reasonable and supportable forecasts and the qualitative framework outlined by the office of the comptroller of the currency in the published interagency policy statement this process allows management to take a holistic view of the recorded acl reserve and ensure that all significant and pertinent information is considered the company considers a variety of factors to ensure the safety and soundness of its estimate including a strong internal control framework extensive methodology documentation credit underwriting standards which encompass the companys desired risk profile model validation and ratio analysis if the companys total acl estimate as determined in accordance with the approved acl methodology is either outside a reasonable range based on review of economic indicators or by comparison of historical ratio analysis the acl estimate is an outlier and management will investigate the underlying reasons based on that investigation issues or factors that previously had not been considered may be identified in the estimation process which may warrant adjustments to estimated credit losses the ending result of this process is a recorded consolidated acl that represents managements best estimate of the total expected losses included in the loan portfolio heldtomaturity securities and credit deterioration in availableforsale securities for more information on loan portfolio segments and acl methodology refer to note loans and allowance for credit losses in the notes to the consolidated financial statements fair value measurements fair value is measured in accordance with gaap which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date valuation techniques used to measure fair value include the market approach income approach and cost approach the market approach uses prices or relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities the income approach involves discounting future amounts to a single present amount and is based on current market expectations about those future amounts the cost approach is based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of the asset gaap establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level an instruments categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the instruments fair value measurement the three levels within the fair value hierarchy are described as follows level quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are available at the measurement date level inputs other than quoted prices included within level that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly level inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means level unobservable inputs for the asset or liability for which there is little if any market activity at the measurement date unobservable inputs reflect assumptions about what market participants would use to price the asset or liability the inputs are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances which might include the companys own financial data such as internally developed pricing models and discounted cash flow methodologies as well as instruments for which the fair value determination requires significant management judgment the companys fair value measurements involve various valuation techniques and models which involve inputs that are observable when available and the most significant of which include availableforsale and trading securities measured at fair value on a recurring basis fair value pricing information obtained from third party data providers and pricing services for investment securities is reviewed for appropriateness on a periodic basis the thirdparty service providers are also analyzed to understand and evaluate the valuation methodologies utilized this review includes an analysis of current market prices compared to pricing provided by the thirdparty pricing service to assess the relative accuracy of the data provided
