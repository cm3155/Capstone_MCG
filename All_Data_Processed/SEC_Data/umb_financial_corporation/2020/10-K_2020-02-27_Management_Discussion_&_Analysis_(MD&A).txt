december our total liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits were million the company cannot reasonably estimate the settlement of these liabilities therefore these liabilities have been excluded from the table above see note income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits critical accounting policies and estimates managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the companys consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates and judgments including those related to customers and suppliers allowance for loan losses bad debts investments financing operations longlived assets taxes other contingencies and litigation management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which have formed the basis for making such judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources under different assumptions or conditions actual results may differ from the recorded estimates management believes that the companys critical accounting policies are those relating to the allowance for loan losses and fair value measurements allowance for loan losses the companys allowance for loan losses represents managements judgment of the loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio the allowance is reviewed quarterly considering both quantitative and qualitative factors such as historical trends internal risk ratings migration analysis concentrations of credit current economic conditions loan growth and individual impairment testing larger commercial loans are individually reviewed for potential impairment for these loans if management deems it probable that the borrower cannot meet its contractual obligations with respect to payment or timing such loans are deemed to be impaired under current accounting standards such loans are then reviewed for potential impairment based on managements estimate of the borrowers ability to repay the loan given the availability of cash flows collateral and other legal options any allowance related to the impairment of an individually impaired loan is based on the present value of discounted expected future cash flows the fair value of the underlying collateral or the fair value of the loan based on this analysis some loans that are classified as impaired do not have a specific allowance as the discounted expected future cash flows or the fair value of the underlying collateral exceeds the companys basis in the impaired loan the company also maintains an internal risk grading system for other loans not subject to individual impairment an estimate of the inherent loan losses on such riskgraded loans is based on a migration analysis which computes the net chargeoff experience related to each risk category an estimate of inherent losses is computed on remaining loans based on the type of loan each type of loan is segregated into a pool based on the nature of such loans this includes remaining commercial loans that have a low risk grade as well as other homogenous loans homogenous loans include automobile loans credit card loans and other consumer loans allowances are established for each pool based on the loan type using historical loss rates certain statistical measures and loan growth an estimate of the total inherent loss is based on the above three computations from this an adjustment can be made based on other factors management considers to be important in evaluating the probable losses in the portfolio such as general economic conditions loan trends risk management and loan administration and changes in internal policies for more information on loan portfolio segments and all methodology refer to note loans and allowance for loan losses in the notes to the consolidated financial statements fair value measurements fair value is measured in accordance with gaap which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date valuation techniques used to measure fair value include the market approach income approach and cost approach the market approach uses prices or relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities the income approach involves discounting future amounts to a single present amount and is based on current market expectations about those future amounts the cost approach is based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of the asset gaap establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level an instruments categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the instruments fair value measurement the three levels within the fair value hierarchy are described as follows level quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are available at the measurement date level inputs other than quoted prices included within level that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly level inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means level unobservable inputs for the asset or liability for which there is little if any market activity at the measurement date unobservable inputs reflect assumptions about what market participants would use to price the asset or liability the inputs are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances which might include the companys own financial data such as internally developed pricing models and discounted cash flow methodologies as well as instruments for which the fair value determination requires significant management judgment the companys fair value measurements involve various valuation techniques and models which involve inputs that are observable when available and the most significant of which include availableforsale and trading securities measured at fair value on a recurring basis fair value pricing information obtained from third party data providers and pricing services for investment securities is reviewed for appropriateness on a periodic basis the third party service providers are also analyzed to understand and evaluate the valuation methodologies utilized this review includes an analysis of current market prices compared to pricing provided by the third party pricing service to assess the relative accuracy of the data provided impact of future accounting pronouncements new accounting policies adopted by the company are discussed in note recently adopted accounting pronouncements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements the expected impact of accounting pronouncements recently issued or proposed but not yet required to be adopted are discussed below credit losses in june the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no measurement of credit losses on financial instruments this update replaces the current incurred loss methodology for recognizing credit losses with a current expected credit loss model which requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts this amendment broadens the information that an entity must consider in developing its expected credit loss estimates additionally the update amends the accounting for credit losses for availableforsale debt securities and purchased financial assets with a morethaninsignificant amount of credit deterioration since origination this update requires enhanced disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of a companys loan portfolio the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after december including interim periods within those fiscal years the amendment requires the use of the modified retrospective approach for adoption the companys implementation plan included a crossfunctional working group including our credit finance and risk management departments to address the adoption and implementation of this amendment based on analysis performed by the company the day impact of adopting asu will be immaterial to the consolidated financial statements the company estimates the cumulative effect adjustment net of tax to be approximately million an increase to the allowance for loan losses of approximately percent and a decrease to the common equity tier capital ratio of approximately four basis points
