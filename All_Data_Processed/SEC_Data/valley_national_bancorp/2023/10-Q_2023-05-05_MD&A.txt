of its financial condition and results of operations in preparing the consolidated financial statements management has made estimates judgments and assumptions in accordance with these policies that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated statements of financial condition and results of operations for the periods indicated at march we identified our policies on the allowance for credit losses goodwill and other intangible assets and income taxes to be critical accounting policies because management has to make subjective andor complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions management has reviewed the application of these policies and estimates with the audit committee of valleys board of directors our critical accounting policies and estimates are described in detail in part ii item in valleys annual report on form 10k for the year ended december and there have been no material changes in such policies and estimates since the date of such report new authoritative accounting

and florida respectively with the remaining percent of the branches in alabama california and illinois combined we have grown significantly both in asset size and locations over the past several years both through organic efforts and bank acquisitions including our acquisition of bank leumi usa on april recent industry developments recent events including the bank failures in march and april the rising level of interest rates and recessionary pressures have heightened concerns in the bank sector we have consistently operated the bank with a focus on diversification to maintain stability

commercial and retail deposit customers an average account size of thousand and an average customer relationship with valley exceeding years as of march approximately billion of our billion in

capital adequacy requirements at march total shareholders equity increased million to billion at march as compared to december see the capital adequacy section for additional details total loans

remained relatively unchanged as compared to december see the investment securities portfolio section for more details quarterly results net income for the first quarter was million or per diluted common share as compared to million or per diluted common share for the first quarter the million increase in quarterly net income as compared to the same quarter one year ago was mainly due to the following changes a million increase in net interest income mainly due to higher average loan balances driven by both acquired and organic loan volumes and increased yields on new and adjustablerate loans partially offset by higher cost of deposits and a million increase in noninterest income primarily due to bank acquisitiondriven growth in wealth management and trust fees service charges on deposit accounts and other income partially offset by a decline in swap fee income within capital markets fees these items were partially offset by a million increase in our provision for credit losses due in part to a million provision for credit losses on available for sale investment securities a million increase in noninterest expense largely due to our expanded banking operations and higher fdic insurance assessment expense and a million increase in income tax expense mostly due to higher pretax income in the first quarter see the net interest income noninterest income noninterest expense and income taxes sections below for more details on the impact of the items above on our first quarter results us economic conditions during t he first quarter real gross domestic product gdp increased at an annual rate of percent as compared to an increase of percent during the fourth quarter the percent increase in real gdp reflected higher consumer spending exports federal government spending state and local government spending and nonresidential fixed investment that were partly offset by decreases in private inventory investment and residential fixed investment during the first quarter the federal reserve raised the target range for the federal funds rate by basis points bringing the target range to to percent at march and by an additional basis points in may to a current range of to percent consistent with its previously announced plan these actions reflect the federal reserves strong commitment to returning inflation to its percent objective the federal open market committee has indicated it will continue to increase the federal funds rate but at a slower pace to stabilize pricing while remaining highly attentive toward the recent banking developments and the delay in which the cumulative tightening of its monetary policy affects the economy the 10year us treasury note yield ended the first quarter of at percent or basis points lower as compared to the fourth quarter and the 2year us treasury note yield ended the first quarter at percent or basis points lower as compared to the fourth quarter for all commercial banks in the us commercial and industrial loans decreased approximately by percent at march as compared to december largely due to decreased customer need for financing inventory and accounts receivables investment in property or equipment and mergers or acquisitions many banks increased the cost of credit lines through widening the spreads of loan rates over the costs of funds to firms of all sizes and increasing premiums for riskier loans while a significant portion of banks also tightened loan covenants and collateralization requirements for firms of all sizes a majority of banks that reported tightening standards or terms on commercial and industrial loans cited a less favorable or more uncertain economic outlook and reduced risk tolerance further increases in market interest rates persistently high inflation heightened recessionary concerns and the potential for additional fallout from the recent banking crisis including bank regulatory actions among other factors have added a higher level of uncertainty to the future path of the us economy and an elevated risk of a recession should economic conditions deteriorate causing business activity spending and investment to decline it may adversely impact our financial results as highlighted in this mda deposits and other borrowings overall average deposits increased by million to billion for the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter mostly due to higher time deposits driven by an increased utilization of fully insured brokered deposits partially offset by a decrease in average noninterest bearing deposits average noninterestbearing deposits savings now and money market deposits and time deposits represented approximately percent percent and percent of total deposits as of march respectively actual ending balances for deposits decreased million to approximately billion at march from december within the deposit categories noninterest bearing deposits and savings now and money market deposits decreased million and million respectively and were mostly offset by an increase in time deposits time deposits increased billion to billion within our overall deposit mix at march from december largely due to higher fully fdicinsured brokered

to twelve months more than twelve months total total estimated uninsured deposits were approximately billion or percent of total deposits at march while our diversified commercial and consumer deposit base has remained stable during the early stages of the second quarter w e believe deposit gathering initiatives may remain challenging due to market competition attractive investment alternatives such as us treasury securities changes in customer behavior and other factors as a result we cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain deposit levels at or near those reported at march the

sold under repurchase agreements federal funds purchased total average longterm borrowings fhlb advances subordinated debt junior subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts total average

liquidity position a verage longterm borrowings including junior subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts which are presented separately on the consolidated statements of financial condition increased million as compared to the first quarter mainly due to the issuance of million of subordinated notes during the third quarter and new fhlb advances issued during the first quarter actual ending balances for shortterm borrowings increased billion to billion at march as compared to december in march we significantly increased our shortterm borrowings mostly consisting of fhlb advances to bolster our liquidity position out of an abundance of caution in the wake of the two recent bank failures since march many of our shortterm fhlb advances have matured and been repaid resulting in a more normal liquidity position we continue to closely monitor changes in the current banking environment and have substantial access to additional liquidity longterm borrowings increased to approximately billion at march as compared to billion at december mainly due to new fhlb advances also issued during the first quarter as part of our overall funding and liquidity strategies see the bank liquidity section for more details on our available funding sources nongaap financial measures the table below presents selected performance indicators their comparative nongaap measures and the nongaap efficiency ratio for the periods indicated valley believes that the nongaap financial measures provide useful supplemental information to both management and investors in understanding its underlying operational performance business and performance trends and may facilitate comparisons of current and prior performance with the performance of others in the financial services industry management utilizes these measures for internal planning forecasting and analysis purposes management believes that valleys presentation and discussion of this supplemental information together with the accompanying reconciliations to the gaap financial measures also allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to management these nongaap financial measures should not be considered in

compared to the fourth quarter and increased million as compared to the first quarter the decrease as compared to the fourth quarter was mainly due to i the negative impact of the significant increase in our excess cash liquidity and other borrowings resulting from prudent and cautionary measures taken by us during the market turmoil of march ii higher interest rates on our average interest bearing deposits and other borrowings as well as iii fewer days in the first quarter interest expense increased million to million for the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter l argely due to a billion increase in average interest bearing liabilities including increases of billion and billion in average time deposits and shortterm borrowings respectively interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased million to million in the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter the increase wa s mostly due to higher average loan balances driven by our organic new loan volumes slowing loan prepayments and increased yields on both new originations and adjustable rate loans in our portfolio average interest earning assets increased billion to billion for the first quarter as compared to the first quarter mainly due to a billion increase in average loan balances and higher average investment balances partly caused by the acquisition of bank leumi usa on april compared to the fourth quarter average interest earning assets increased by billion during the first quarter the increase was primarily driven by a billion increase in average loan balances due to organic loan growth mainly in the commercial loan categories and billion increase in average interest bearing cash held mainly overnight with the federal reserve bank of new york as part of our liquidity management average interest bearing liabilities increased billion to billion for the first quarter as compared to the first quarter mainly due to increases of billion and billion in average time deposits and shortterm borrowings respectively the increases in average time deposits and shortterm borrowings were largely due to the liquidity management efforts during march and our increased usage of fully fdicinsured brokered cd and successful retail cd initiatives as part of our funding sources for loan growth over the last months as compared to the fourth quarter average interest bearing liabilities increased by billion in the first quarter largely due to a billion increase in average time deposits mainly driven by the higher fully insured brokered cd balances and additional fhlb advances within shortterm borrowings see additional information under deposits and other borrowings in the executive summary section above net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis of percent for the first quarter decreased by basis points from percent for the fourth quarter and remained unchanged from the first quarter the decrease as compared to the fourth quarter was largely driven by i the net impact of the excess liquidity measures taken in march and ii two fewer days during the first quarter partially offset by higher yields on average interest earning assets the yield on average interest earning assets increased by basis points on a linked quarter basis mostly due to the aforementioned higher yields on new and adjustable rate loans in the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter the yield on average loans increased by basis points to percent for the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter largely due to the higher level of market interest rates the yields on average taxable and nontaxable investments also increased basis points and basis points respectively from the fourth quarter l argely due to investment maturities and repayments redeployed into new higher yielding securities as well as lower premium amortization expense caused by a decline in prepayments on mortgagebacked securities during the first quarter our cost of total average deposits increased to percent for the first quarter from percent for the fourth quarter the overall cost of average interest bearing liab ilities also increased basis points to percent for the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter largely due to a basis point increase in cost of average shortterm borrowings based upon our revised estimates at march we anticipate net interest income growth of approximately to percent for the full year of down from to percent previously estimated in the mda of valleys form 10k for the year ended december while our revised outlook for our net interest income is still positive we cannot provide any assurances with respect to the future trajectory of market interest rates or that our net interest margin or income will remain at the levels reported for the first

respectively our effective tax rate was percent and percent for the three months ended march and respectively the increase in the effective tax rate in the first quarter as compared to the same period of was mainly due to a smaller benefit in excess stock compensation and a newly established valuation allowance against a loss provision on available for sale debt securities us gaap requires that any change in judgment or change in measurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period be recognized as a discrete event in the quarter in which it occurs rather than being recognized as a change in effective tax rate for the current year our adherence to these tax guidelines may result in volatile effective income tax rates in future quarterly and annual periods factors that could impact managements judgment include changes in income tax laws and regulations and tax planning strategies operating segments at march and december valley managed its business operations under

income taxes and return on average interest earning assets and impairment if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount valley regularly assesses its strategic plans operations and reporting structures to identify its reportable segments and no changes to the reportable segments were determined necessary during the first quarter the accounting for each segment includes internal accounting policies designed to measure consistent and reasonable financial reporting and may result in income and expense measurements that differ from amounts under us gaap furthermore changes in management structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result in changes in reported segment financial data the balances presented for three months ended march

consumer banking represented percent of our loan portfolio at march and was mainly comprised of residential mortgage loans and automobile loans and to a lesser extent home equity loans secured personal lines of credit and other consumer loans including credit card loans the duration of the residential mortgage loan portfolio which represented percent of our loan portfolio at march is subject to movements in the market level of interest rates and forecasted prepayment speeds the weighted average life of the automobile loans which represented percent of total loans at march is relatively unaffected by movements in the market level of interest rates however the average life may be impacted by new loans as a result of the availability of credit within the automobile marketplace and consumer demand for purchasing new or used automobiles consumer banking also includes the wealth management and insurance services division comprised of trust asset management brokerage insurance and tax credit advisory services average interest earning assets within consumer banking increased billion to billion for the three months ended march as compared to the same period of the increase was largely due to new residential mortgage loan volumes originated for investment rather than sale over the last 12month period and to a lesser extent growth in automobile home equity and secured personal lines of credit income before income taxes for consumer banking decreased million to million for the first quarter as compared to the first quarter mainly driven by lower net interest income and to a lesser extent increases in the provision for loan losses and internal transfer expense net interest income decreased million in the first quarter as compared to the same period of due to additional interest expense generated from higher average deposit and other borrowing balances as well as an increase in interest rate s the provision for loan losses increased

one year ago see further details in the allowance for credit losses section of this mda internal transfer expense increased million for the first quarter as compared to the first quarter net interest margin on the consumer banking portfolio decreased basis points to percent for the first quarter as compared to the first quarter mainly due to a basis point increase in the costs associated with our funding sou rces partially offset by a basis point increase in the yield on average loans the increase in our funding costs was mainly driven by higher interest rates on most of our interest bearing commercial and retail deposit products increased utilization of fully fdicinsured brokered deposits and higher cost of other borrowings held during the first quarter the basis point increase in loan yield was largely due to higher yielding new loan volumes and adjustable rate loans in our portfolio see the executive summary and the net interest income sections above for more details on our net

to the same period a year ago due to the higher allocation of noninterest expense over the same period noninterest income increased million during the three months ended march as compared to the same period in mostly due to incremental increases in several operating noninterest income categories caused by the acquisition of bank leumi usa and organic growth of our business operations over the last 12month period provision for credit losses increased million mainly due to a corporate bond issued by signature bank within our afs debt securities portfolio that was fully chargedoff during the first quarter the net interest margin for this segment increased basis points to percent for the first quarter as compared to the first quarter due to a basis point increase in the yield on average investments partially offset by a basis point increase in cost of our funding sources the increase in the yield on average investments as compared to the same period a year ago was largely driven by new higher yielding investments and a reduction in premium amortization expense mostly caused by slower principal repayments in the rising interest rate environment assetliability management interest rate risk our success is largely dependent upon our ability to manage interest rate risk interest rate risk can be defined as the exposure of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities to the movement in interest rates our assetliability management committee is responsible for managing such risks and establishing policies that monitor and coordinate our sources and uses of funds assetliability management is a continuous process due to the constant change in interest rate risk factors in assessing the appropriate interest rate risk levels for us management weighs the potential benefit of each risk management activity within the desired parameters of liquidity capital levels and managements tolerance for exposure to income fluctuations many of the actions undertaken by management utilize fair value analysis and attempt to achieve consistent accounting and economic benefits for financial assets and their related funding sources we have predominantly focused on managing our interest rate risk by attempting to match the inherent risk and cash flows of financial assets and liabilities specifically management employs multiple risk management activities such as optimizing the level of new residential mortgage originations retained in our mortgage portfolio through increasing or decreasing loan sales in the secondary market product pricing levels the desired maturity levels for new originations the composition levels of both our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as well as several other risk management activities we use a simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity to movements in interest rates the simulation model projects net interest income based on various interest rate scenarios over a 12month and 24month period the model is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of rate sensitive assets and liabilities the model incorporates certain assumptions which management believes to be reasonable regarding the impact of changing interest rates and the prepayment assumptions of certain assets and liabilities as of march the model assumes immediate changes in interest rates without any proactive change in the composition or size of the balance sheet or other future actions that management might undertake to mitigate this risk in the model the forecasted shape of the yield curve remains static as of march the impact of interest rate derivatives such as interest rate swaps is also included in the model our simulation model is based on market interest rates and prepayment speeds prevalent in the market as of march although the size of valleys balance sheet is forecasted to remain static as of march in our model the composition is adjusted to reflect new interest earning assets and funding originations coupled with rate spreads utilizing our actual originations during the first quarter the model also utilizes an immediate parallel shift in market interest rates at march the assumptions used in the net interest income simulation are inherently uncertain actual results may differ significantly from those presented in the table below due to the frequency and timing of changes in interest rates and changes in spreads between maturity and repricing categories overall our net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates and cash flows from our loan and investment portfolios we actively manage these cash flows in conjunction with our liability mix duration and interest rates to optimize the net interest income while structuring the balance sheet in response to actual or potential changes in interest rates additionally our net interest income is impacted by the level of competition within our marketplace competition can negatively impact the level of interest rates attainable on loans and increase the cost of deposits which may result in downward pressure on our net interest margin in future periods other factors including but not limited to the slope of the yield curve and projected cash flows will impact our net interest income results and may increase or decrease the level of asset sensitivity of our balance sheet convexity is a measure of how the duration of a financial instrument changes as market interest rates change potential movements in the convexity of bonds held in our investment portfolio as well as the duration of the loan portfolio may have a positive or negative impact on our net interest income in varying interest rate environments as a result the increase or decrease in forecasted net interest income may not have a linear relationship to the results reflected in the table below management cannot provide any assurance about the actual effect of changes in interest rates on our net interest income the following table reflects managements expectations of the change in our net interest income over the next month period considering the aforementioned assumptions while an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this simulation model we believe that any actual shift in interest rates would likely be more gradual and would therefore have a more modest impact than shown in the table below estimated change in future net interest income changes in interest rates dollar change percentage change in basis points in thousands as noted in the table above a basis point immediate increase in interest rates combined with a static balance sheet where the size mix and proportions of assets and liabilities remain unchanged is projected to increase net interest income over the next 12month period by percent management believes the interest rate sensitivity of our balance sheet remains within an acceptable tolerance range at march however the level of net interest income sensitivity may increase or decrease in the future as a result of several factors including potential changes in our balance sheet strategies the slope of the yield curve and projected cash flows liquidity and cash requirements bank liquidity liquidity measures the ability to satisfy current and future cash flow needs as they become due a banks liquidity reflects its ability to meet loan demand to accommodate possible outflows in deposits and to take advantage of interest rate opportunities in the marketplace liquidity management is carefully performed and routinely reported by our treasury department to two board committees among other actions treasury reviews historical funding requirements our current liquidity position sources and stability of funding marketability of assets options for attracting additional funds and anticipated future funding needs including the level of unfunded commitments our goal is to maintain sufficient liquidity to cover current and potential funding requirements the bank adheres to certain internal liquidity guidelines including ratios of loans to deposits below percent and wholesale funding to total funding below percent management maintains flexibility to temporarily exceed these limits in certain operating environments our loan to deposits and wholesale funding to total funding ratios were approximately percent and percent at march respectively the level of wholesale funding and resulting excess cash on our balance sheet at march was mostly due to the cautionary liquidity actions taken in march valleys short and longterm cash requirements include contractual obligations under borrowings deposits payment related to leases capital expenditures and other purchase commitments in the ordinary course of operations the bank also enters into various financial obligations including contractual obligations that may require future cash payments management believes the bank has the ability to generate and obtain adequate amounts of cash to meet its shortterm and longterm obligations as they come due by utilizing various cash resources described below on the asset side of the balance sheet the bank has numerous sources of liquid funds in the form of cash and due from banks interest bearing deposits with banks including the federal reserve bank of new york investment securities held to maturity that are maturing within days or would otherwise qualify as maturities if sold ie percent of original cost basis has been repaid investment securities classified as trading and available for sale loans held for sale and from time to time federal funds sold and receivables related to unsettled securities transactions total liquid assets were approximate ly billion representing percent of earning assets at march and billion representing percent of earning assets at december of the billion of liquid assets at march approximately million of various investment securities were pledged to counterparties to support our earning asset funding strategies we anticipate the receipt of approx imately million in principal payments from securities in the total investment portfolio at march over the next 12month period due to normally scheduled principal repayments and expected prepayments of certain securities primarily residential mortgagebacked securities additional liquidity is derived from scheduled loan payments of principal and interest as well as prepayments received loan principal payments from total loans and loans held for sale at march are projected to be approximately billion over the next 12month period as a contingency plan for any liquidity constraints liquidity could also be derived from the sale of conforming residential mortgages from our loan portfolio or alleviated from the temporary curtail ment of lending activities on the liability side of the balance sheet we utilize multiple sources of funds to meet liquidity needs including retail and commercial deposits fully fdicinsured brokered and municipal deposits and shortterm and longterm borrowings our core deposit base which generally excludes all fully insured brokered deposits as well as retail certificates of deposit over thousand represents the largest of these sources average core deposits totaled approximately billion and billion for the three months ended march and for the year ended december respectively representing percent and percent of average earning assets for the respective periods the level of interest bearing deposits is affected by interest rates offered which is often influenced by our need for funds and the need to match the maturities of assets and liabilities in addition to direct customer deposits the bank has ample access to readily available diverse funding sources to fulfill its current and projected capital needs the bank is a member of the federal home loan bank of new york fhlb and has the ability to borrow from them in the form of fhlb advances secured by pledges of certain eligible collateral including but not limited to us government and agency mortgagebacked securities and a blanket assignment of qualifying first lien mortgage loans consisting of both residential mortgage and commercial real estate loans at march available borrowing potential above and beyond amounts already utilized at these institutions totaled billion including borrowing capacity under the federal reserve banks discount window totaling billion additional funding may be provided through deposit gathering networks and in the form of federal funds purchased through our wellestablished relationships with numerous banks the bank has access to approximately billion of uncommitted lines for the purchase of federal funds from these banks on a collective basis additionally valleys collateral pledged to the fhlb may be used to obtain municipal letters of credit muloc to collateralize certain municipal deposits held by valley at march valley h ad billion of mulocs outstanding for this purpose we also have access to other shortterm and longterm borrowing sources to support our asset base such as repos ie securities sold under agreements to repurchase shortterm borrowings increased billion to billion at march as compared to december in march we increased our shortterm borrowings out of an abundance of caution to prudently bolster our liquidity position in the wake of the two recent bank failures since march shortterm fhlb advances have been allowed to mature resulting in a more normal liquidity position we continue to closely monitor changes in the current banking environment and have substantial access to additional liquidity as highlighted above additionally the federal reserve established the bank term funding program on march as funding source for eligible depository institutions the program can provide shortterm liquidity up to one year against the par value of certain highquality collateral such as us treasury securities and eliminate the potential need for an institution to sell those securities in times of stress advances under the program can be requested until march as of march valley did not participate in this program but currently has this option as an available shortterm liquidity source corporation liquidity valleys recurring cash requirements primarily consist of dividends to preferred and common shareholders and interest expense on subordinated notes and junior subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts as part of our ongoing assetliability management strategies valley could also use cash to repurchase shares of its outstanding common stock under its share repurchase program or redeem its callable junior subordinated debentures and subordinated notes valleys cash needs are routinely satisfied by dividends collected from the bank projected cash flows from the bank are expected to be adequate to pay preferred and common dividends if declared and interest expense payable to subordinated note holders and capital trusts given the current capital levels and current profitable operations of the bank in addition to dividends received from the bank valley can satisfy its cash requirements by utilizing its own cash and potential new funds borrowed from outside sources or capital issuances valley also has the right to defer interest payments on the junior subordinated debentures and therefore distributions on its trust preferred securities for consecutive quarterly periods of up to five years but not beyond the stated maturity dates and subject to other conditions investment securities portfolio as of march we had million billion and billion in equity available for sale debt securities and held to maturity debt securities respectively the available for sale and held to maturity debt securities portfolios which comprise the majority of the securities we own include us treasury securities us government agency securities taxexempt and taxable issuances of states and political subdivisions residential mortgagebacked securities singleissuer trust preferred securities principally issued by bank holding companies and high quality corporate bonds among other securities our available for sale debt securities include securities such as bank issued and other corporate bonds as well as municipal special revenue bonds which may pose a higher risk of future impairment charges to us as a result of the uncertain economic environment and its potential negative effect on the future performance of the security issuers the equity securities consisted of two publicly traded mutual funds cra investments and several other equity investments we have made in companies that develop new financial technologies and in partnerships that invest in such companies our cra and other equity investments are a mix of both publicly traded entities and privately held entities we also had million of trading debt securities at march consisting of investment grade municipal bonds and us treasury securities we continually evaluate our investment securities portfolio in response to established assetliability management objectives changing market conditions that could affect profitability and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed to these evaluations may cause us to change the level of funds we deploy into investment securities change the composition of our investment securities portfolio and change the proportion of investments primarily made into the available for sale and held to maturity debt securities portfolios allowance for credit losses and impairment analysis available for sale debt securities available for sale debt securities in unrealized loss positions are evaluated for impairment related to credit losses at least quarterly in assessing whether a credit loss exists we compare the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security with the amortized cost basis of the security if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis for the security a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded limited to the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis declines in fair value that have not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses such as declines due to changes in market interest rates are recorded through other comprehensive loss net of applicable taxes we have evaluated all available for sale debt securities that are in an unrealized loss position as of march and december and determined that the declines in fair value were mainly attributable to changes in market v olatility due to factors such as interest rates and spread factors but not attributable to credit quality or other factors based on a comparison of the present value of expected cash flows to the amortized cost valley recognized a credit related impairment of one corporate bond issued by signature bank resulting in both a provision for credit losses and full chargeoff of the security totaling million during the three months ended march there was no other impairment recognized within the available for sale debt securities portfolio during the three months ended march valley does not intend to sell any of its available for sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position prior to recovery of our amortized cost basis and it is more likely than not that valley will not be required to sell any of its securities prior to recovery of our amortized cost basis none of the available for sale debt securities were past due as of march and t here was no allowance for credit losses for available for sale debt securities at march and december held to maturity debt securities valley estimates the expected credit losses on held to maturity debt securities that have loss expectations using a discounted cash flow model developed by a third party valley has a zeroloss expectation for certain securities within the held to maturity portfolio including us treasury securities us agency securities residential mortgagebacked securities issued by ginnie mae fannie mae and freddie mac and collateralized municipal bonds to measure the expected credit losses on held to maturity debt securities that have loss expectations valley estimates the expected credit losses using a discounted cash flow model developed by a third party assumptions used in the model for pools of securities with common risk characteristics include the historical lifetime probability of default and severity of loss in the event of default with the model incorporating several economic cycles of loss history data to calculate expected credit losses given default at the individual security level held to maturity debt securities were carried net of an allowance for credit losses totaling approximately million at both march and december investment grades the investment grades in the table below reflect the most current independent analysis performed by third parties of each security as of the date presented and not necessarily the investment grades at the date of our purchase of the securities for many securities the rating agencies may not have performed an independent analysis of the tranches owned by us but rather an analysis of the entire investment pool for this and other reasons we believe the assigned investment grades may not accurately reflect the actual credit quality of each security and should not be viewed in isolation as a measure of the quality of our investment portfolio the following table presents the available for sale and held to maturity debt investment securities portfolios by investment grades at march march amortized cost gross unrealized gains gross unrealized losses fair value in thousands available for sale investment grades aaa rated aa rated a rated bbb rated not rated total held to maturity

ratings categories include the entire range for example a rated includes a a and a split rated securities with two ratings are categorized at the higher of the rating levels the unrealized losses in the aaa and aa rated categories of both the available for sale and held to maturity debt securities portfolios in the above table were largely related to residential mortgagebacked securities issued by ginnie mae fannie mae and freddie mac and continued to be driven by the rising interest rate environment during the last months the investment securities available for sale and held to maturity portfolio included million and million respectively of investments not rated by the rating agencies with aggregate unrealized losses of million and million respectively at march the unrealized losses within nonrated available for sale debt securities was mostly related to several large corporate bonds negatively impacted by rising interest rates and not changes in underlying credit the unrealized losses within nonrated held to maturity debt securities mostly related to four singleissuer bank trust preferred issuances with a combined amortized cost of million and several corporate and other debt securities see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our investment securities portfolio loan portfolio the following table reflects the composition of the loan portfolio as of the dates presented march december in thousands loans commercial and industrial commercial real estate commercial real estate construction total commercial real estate residential mortgage consumer home equity automobile other consumer total consumer loans total loans as a percent of total loans commercial and industrial commercial real estate residential mortgage consumer loans total includes net unearned discount and deferred loan fees of million and million at march and december respectively total loans increased billion or percent on an annualized basis to billion at march from december mainly due to continued strong organic loan growth in commercial loan categories and a slower loan prepayment activity within the loan portfolio during the first quarter total commercial real estate including construction and commercial and industrial loans increased percent and percent respectively on an annualized basis during the first quarter residential mortgage loans held for sale at fair value totaled million and million at march and december respectively commercial and industrial loans increased million to billion at march as compared to december the organic growth was mainly a result of the solid new loan volumes from our preexisting longterm customer base across most of our geographic footprints as well as the continued efforts of our commercial banking relationship teams commercial real estate loans excluding construction loans increased billion to billion at march from december reflecting solid organic growth mainly due to demand for nonowner occupied loans across our geographic footprint our organic approach of loan production is primarily the expansion of lending with our existing clients while also establishing new relationships in our primary and new market areas we continue to grow our commercial lending activities from out of market expansion efforts in states such as pennsylvania georgia and tennessee as well as our relatively new markets in california and illinois in addition our commercial real estate production remained strong in loans secured by multifamily dwellings warehouses and healthcare facilities at march commercial real estate loans collateralized by office buildings were approximately billion of the billion portfolio these loans are geographically disbursed largely across florida alabama new jersey new york and manhattan with a combined weighted average loan to value ratio of percent and debt service coverage ratio of construction loans increased only million to billion at march from december mainly driven by advances on preexiting construction loan projects in new jersey new york and florida the growth in new construction loans was partially offset by the runoff of completed existing projects and to a lesser extent migration of such completed projects to permanent financing residential mortgage loans increased million or percent on an annualized basis during the first quarter as we largely originated new loans for the held for investment portfolio rather than for sale new and refinanced residential mortgage loan originations totaled million for the first quarter as compared to million and million for the fourth quarter and first quarter respectively florida originations totaled million and represented percent of total residential mortgage loan originations in the quarter during the first quarter we retained approximately percent of the total residential mortgage originations in our held for investment loan portfolio of the total originations in the first quarter only million of residential mortgage loans were originated for sale rather than held for investment as compared to million during the first quarter we may continue to retain a higher percentage of new loan volumes during the second quarter mainly due to our management of the interest rate risk and the mix of the interest earning assets on our balance sheet additionally the volume of both new and refinanced loan applications has remained relatively low in the early stages of the second quarter due to the high level of mortgage interest rates and tight housing inventories and may challenge our ability to grow this loan category home equity loans increased by million to million at march compared to december as a result of modest growth in new originations that continues to be challenged by the unfavorable high interest rate environment automobile loans decreased by million or percent on an annualized basis to billion at march as compared to december largely due to lower consumer demand for new and used vehicle financing because of the higher interest rate environment during the first quarter the interest rates on new car loans reached the highest level since we originated million in auto loans through our dealership network during the first quarter as compared to million in the fourth quarter of the total originations our florida dealership network represented approximately percent of new loans during the first quarter despite increased new automobile inventories available to consumers we anticipate that the impact of inflation on average new vehicle prices coupled with rising interest rates could continue to have a negative impact on our ability to grow this loan category during the second quarter other consumer loans increased million to billion at march as compared to december mainly due to moderate growth in our collateralized personal lines of credit portfolio a significant part of our lendin g is in northern and central new jersey new york city long island and florida to mitigate our geographic risks we make efforts to maintain a diversified portfolio as to type of borrower and loan to guard against a potential downward turn in any one economic sector while confident in our commercial loan pipelines and diverse residential and consumer loan offerings there can be no assurance that the growth trends experienced in most loan categories during the first quarter will continue or loan balances will not decline from march we expect a more challenging overall loan origination environment moving forward especially in the residential mortgage and consumer loan portfolios due to the impact of higher market interest rates on customer demand and selective tightening of certain underwriting standards by valley nonperforming assets nonperforming assets npa include nonaccrual loans other real estate owned oreo and other repossessed assets which primarily consist of automobiles and taxi medallions at march loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when they become past due in excess of days as to payment of principal or interest exceptions to the nonaccrual policy may be permitted if the loan is sufficiently collateralized and in the process of collection oreo is acquired through foreclosure on loans secured by land or real estate oreo and other repossessed assets are reported at lower of cost or fair value less estimated cost to sell our npas decreased million to million at march as compared to december mainly due to two large chargeoffs within nonaccrual commercial and industrial and construction loans during the first quarter npas as a percentage of total loans and npas totaled percent and percent at march and december respectively as shown in the table below our total npas has remained relatively low as a percentage of the total loan portfolio and the level of npas which is reflective of our consistent approach to the loan underwriting criteria for both valley originated loans and loans purchased from third parties for additional details see the credit quality indicators section in note to the consolidated financial statements our lending strategy is based on underwriting standards designed to maintain high credit quality and we remain optimistic regarding the overall future performance of our loan portfolio during the three months ended march our overall credit trends have remained stable and our business and borrowers continued to demonstrate resilience and growth despite the unexpected challenges across the banking system slower economic growth persistently elevated inflation and the overall uncertain economy however management cannot provide assurance that the nonperforming assets will not materially increase from the levels reported at march due to the aforementioned or other factors potentially impacting our lending customers the following table sets forth by loan category accruing past due and nonperforming assets at the dates indicated in conjunction with our asset quality ratios march december in thousands accruing past due loans to days past due commercial and industrial commercial real

total nonaccrual loans as a of loans total npas as a of loans and npas total accruing past due and nonaccrual loans as a of loans allowance for loan losses as a of nonaccrual loans loans past due to days increased million to million at march as compared to december mostly due to several large co mmercial and industrial loans and one matured commercial real estate loan in the process of renewal included in this delinquency category at march these increases were partially offset by improved performance within the residential mortgage and consumer loan categories loans past due to days increased million to million at march as compared to december primarily due to higher commercial and industrial loans largely driven by a few large loans included in this delinquency category at march loans days or more past due and still accruing interest decreased million to million at march as compared to december mainly due to the renewals in the normal course of two matured loans during the first quarter that were previously included in this delinquency category at december all loans days or more past due and still accruing interest are wellsecured and in the process of collection nonaccrual loans decreased million to million at march as compared to million at december mainly driven by decreases in commercial and industrial loans and construction loans nonaccrual commercial and industrial loans decreased million primarily due to the chargeoff of one loan participation that was fully reserved for in our allowance for loan losses at december the decrease of million in construction loans is mostly related to t he partial chargeoff of one loan relationship during the first quarter that had related allowance reserves totaling million at december although the timing of collection is uncertain management believes that the majority of the nonaccrual loans at march are well secured and largely collectible based in part on our quarterly review of collateral dependent loans and the valuation of the underlying collateral if applicable any estimated shortfall in each collateral valuation results in an allocation of specific reserves within our allowance for credit losses for loans nonperforming taxi medallion loans totaled million of the million nonaccrual commercial and industrial loans at march at march all taxi medallion loans in the loan portfolio were on nonaccrual status and had related reserves of million or percent of such loans within the allowance for loan losses potential further declines in the market valuation of taxi medallions and the current operating environment mainly within new york city may negatively impact the performance of this portfolio oreo properties totaled million at march and increased thousand as compared to december there were no sales of oreo properties in the first quarter and net gains on sales of oreo in the first quarter were not material the residential mortgage and consumer loans secured by residential real estate properties for which formal foreclosure proceedings are in process totale d million and million at march and december respectively allowance for credit losses for loans the allowance for credit losses acl for loans includes the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments under cecl our methodology to establish the allowance for loan losses has two basic components i a collective reserve component for estimated expected credit losses for pools of loans that share common risk characteristics and ii an individual reserve component for loans that do not share risk characteristics consisting of collateral dependent loans valley also maintains a separate allowance for unfunded credit commitments mainly consisting of undisbursed noncancellable lines of credit new loan commitments and commercial standby letters of credit valley estimated the collective acl using a current expected credit losses methodology which is based on relevant information about historical experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the loan balances in estimating the component of the allowance on a collective basis we use a transition matrix model which calculates an expected life of loan loss percentage for each loan pool by generating probability of default and loss given default metrics the metrics are based on the migration of loans within the commercial and industrial loan categories from performing to loss by credit quality rating or delinquency categories using historical lifeofloan analysis periods for each loan portfolio pool and the severity of loss based on the aggregate net lifetime losses the models expected losses based on loss history are adjusted for qualitative factors among other things these adjustments include and account for differences in i the impact of the reasonable and supportable economic forecast relative probability weightings and reversion period ii other asset specific risks to the extent that they do not exist in the historical loss information and iii net expected recoveries of chargedoff loan balances these adjustments are based on qualitative factors not reflected in the quantitative model but are likely to impact the measurement of estimated credit losses the expected lifetime loss rate is the life of loan loss percentage from the transition matrix model plus the impact of the adjustments for qualitative factors the expected credit losses are the product of multiplying the models expected lifetime loss rate by the exposure at default at period end on an undiscounted basis valley utilizes a twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period followed by a oneyear period over which estimated losses revert to historical loss experience for the remaining life of the loan on a straightline basis the forecasts consist of a multiscenario economic forecast model to estimate future credit losses and is governed by a crossfunctional committee the committee meets each quarter to determine which economic scenarios developed by moodys will be incorporated into the model as well as the relative probability weightings of the selected scenarios based upon all readily available information the model projects economic variables under each scenario based on detailed statistical analyses we have identified and selected key variables that most closely correlated to our historical credit performance which include gdp unemployment and the caseshiller home price index at march the probability weightings used in our economic forecast inclusive of the moodys baseline s3 downside and s4 adverse scenarios remained unchanged from december the standalone moodys baseline scenario reflects a slightly more optimistic outlook as compared to december in terms of gdp growth and unemployment levels but the overall outlook remained relatively weak the updated moodys forecasts were not materially impacted by the recent bank failures as they noted the failures did not appear to be symptomatic of serious broadbased issues in the financial system at march the moodys baseline forecast included the following specific assumptions gdp expansion approximately percent in the second quarter unemployment of percent in the second quarter and to percent over the remainder of the forecast period ending in the first quarter continued concerns about increased federal debt burden pushed by rising interest rates high inflation elevated house prices and lower consumer spending the federal reserve continues its tightening monetary policy including an increase of basis points at its may meeting but intends to keep rates steady through with no reductions until and inflation remains

respectively during the first quarter the provision for credit losses for loans totaled million as compared to million and million for the fourth quarter and first quarter respectively at march our
