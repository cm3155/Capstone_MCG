of its financial condition and results of operations in preparing the consolidated financial statements management has made estimates judgments and assumptions in accordance with these policies that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated statements of financial condition and results of operations for the periods indicated at june we identified our policies on the allowance for credit losses goodwill and other intangible assets and income taxes to be critical accounting policies because management has to make subjective andor complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions management has reviewed the application of these policies and estimates with the audit committee of valleys board of directors our critical accounting policies and estimates are described in detail in part ii item in valleys annual report on form 10k for the year ended december and there have been no material changes in such policies and estimates since the date of such report new authoritative accounting guidance see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new authoritative accounting guidance including the respective dates of adoption and effects on results of operations

shareholders equity of billion valley operates many convenient branch office locations and commercial banking offices in northern and central new jersey the new york city boroughs of manhattan brooklyn and queens long island westchester county new york florida california alabama and illinois of our current branch network percent percent and percent of the branches are in new jersey new york and florida respectively with the remaining percent of the branches in alabama california and illinois combined we have grown significantly both in asset size and locations over the past several years both through organic efforts and bank acquisitions including our acquisition of bank leumi usa on april industry developments the combination of rapidly rising interest rates increased competition and economic uncertainty continues to weigh on the banking industry in the wake of the recent bank failures we have consistently operated the bank with a focus on diversification to maintain stability through various economic cycles during the second quarter we continued to position our balance sheet to mitigate potential risks from the market uncertainty affecting the banking industry in general and valley its clients and communities in particular total assets decreased to billion at june a decrease of percent from march liquidity remained strong with total liquid assets of approximate ly billion at june representing percent of interest earning assets we continue to maintain significant access to readily available diverse funding sources to fulfill both shortterm and longterm funding needs see bank liquidity section for additional information total deposits increased billion to billion at june as compared to billion at march largely due to higher cd balances see the deposits and other borrowings section for more details capital remained strong with ratios of both valley and the bank exceeding all capital adequacy requirements at june total shareholders equity increased million to billion at june as compared to march see the capital adequacy section for additional details total loans increased billion or percent on an annualized basis to billion at june from march mainly due to continued organic loan growth in commercial loan categories and relatively low levels of prepayment activity during the second quarter see loan portfolio section for more information asset quality continued to reflect our disciplined underwriting and lending practices during the second quarter nonperforming assets npas as a percentage of total loans and npas totaled percent and percent at june and march respectively see the nonperforming assets section for additional information total investment securities were billion or percent of total assets at june and remained relatively unchanged as compared to march see the investment securities portfolio section for more details quarterly results net income for the second quarter was million or per diluted common share as compared to million or per diluted common share for the second quarter the million increase in quarterly net income as compared to the same quarter one year ago was mainly due to the following changes a million decrease in our provision for credit losses mainly due to a provision related to nonpcd loans and unfunded credit commitments acquired from bank leumi usa in the second quarter a million increase in net interest income mainly due to increased yields on both new loan originations and adjustablerate loans and higher average loan balances largely offset by the increased cost of deposits a million increase in noninterest income primarily due to an increase in capital markets fees and wealth management and trust fees partially offset by lower n et gains on sales of loans and a million decrease in noninterest expense was due in part to a million decrease in merger expenses partially offset by a million restructuring charge and various other increases these items were partially offset by a million increase in income tax expense mostly due to higher pretax income in the second quarter see the net interest income noninterest income noninterest expense and income taxes sections below for more details on the impact of the items above on our second quarter results us economic conditions during t he second quarter real gross domestic product gdp increased at an annual rate of percent as compared to an increase of percent during the first quarter the percent increase in real gdp reflected robust consumer spending private inventory investment nonresidential fixed investment and government spending as well as improved supply chain inflation moderately cooled but remained well above the federal reserves target of percent in the second quarter during the first quarter the federal reserve raised the target range for the federal funds rate by an additional basis points in may and paused rate increases in june to observe the full impact of its changes over the past year in july the federal reserve raised the target again by another basis points to a range of to percent the 10year us treasury note yield ended the second quarter at percent or basis points higher as compared to the first quarter and the 2year us treasury note yield ended the second quarter at percent or basis points higher as compared to the first quarter for all us commercial banks commercial and industrial loans decreased approximately by percent at june as compared to march while consumer loans increased by percent alternatively demand for commercial real estate loans remained flat compared to the prior quarter overall the commercial real estate market was constricted by the financial environment this quarter as rising interest rates eroded investment profitability despite higher mortgage rates demand for residential real estate remained steady although sales were constrained by low inventories while many economic measures continue to defy recessionary concerns further increases in market interest rates the inverted yield curve high inflation and the potential for additional fallout from the recent banking crisis including bank regulatory actions among other factors have added a higher level of uncertainty to the future path of the us economy and created a challenging banking environment should economic conditions deteriorate causing business activity spending and investment to decline it may adversely impact our financial results as highlighted in this mda deposits and other borrowings overall average deposits increased by million to billion for the second quarter as compared to the first quarter mostly due to higher time deposits driven by successful retail cd generation and increased utilization of fully insured indirect customer ie brokered deposits partially offset by a decrease in average noninterest bearing deposits the decline in noninterest bearing deposits was largely due to a moderate shift in customer balances to our interest bearing deposit products in a rising interest rate environment and outflows due to attractive investment alternatives to deposits in the marketplace average noninterestbearing deposits savings now and money market deposits and time deposits represented approximately percent percent and percent of total deposits as of june respectively actual ending balances for deposits increased billion to approximately billion at june from march mainly due to a billion increase in time deposits partially offset by decreases in noninterest bearing deposits and savings now and money market deposits totaling billion and million respectively the increase in time deposits from march was partially driven by higher fullyinsured indirect customer cd balances at june total fullyinsured indirect customer deposits consisting of both brokered time deposit and money market accounts increased billion to billion at june from march noninterest bearing deposits savings now and money market deposits and time deposits represented approximately percent percent and percent of total deposits as of june respectively as compared to percent percent and percent of total deposits as of march respectively the following table lists by maturity uninsured certificates of deposit at june in thousands less than three months three to six months six to twelve months more than twelve months total total estimated uninsured deposits excluding collateralized government deposits and intercompany deposits ie deposits eliminated in consolidation totaled approximately billion or percent of total deposits at june as compared to billion or percent of total deposits at march while our diversified commercial and consumer deposit base has remained relatively stable during the early stages of the third quarter deposit gathering initiatives could remain challenging due to market competition attractive investment alternatives such as us treasury securities and other factors as a result we cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain deposit levels at or near those reported at june the following table presents average shortterm and longterm borrowings for the periods indicated three months ended six months ended june march june june june in thousands average shortterm borrowings fhlb advances securities sold under repurchase agreements federal funds purchased total average longterm borrowings fhlb advances subordinated debt junior subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts total average shortterm borrowings increased billion during the second quarter as compared to the first quarter mostly due to the higher utilization of fhlb advances in march to increase our excess liquidity position average longterm borrowings including junior subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts which are presented separately on the consolidated statements of financial condition increased million as compared to the first quarter mainly due to the new fhlb advances issued in march and the second quarter actual ending balances for shortterm borrowings decreased billion to billion at june as compared to march mainly due to maturities and repayment of fhlb advances in march we increased our shortterm borrowings to bolster our liquidity position out of an abundance of caution in the wake of the two bank failures and subsequently managed these balances to a lower level during the second quarter partially through the greater use of time deposits we continue to closely monitor changes in the current banking environment and have substantial access to additional liquidity actual ending balances for longterm borrowings totaled billion at june and remained relatively unchanged as compared to march see the bank liquidity section for more details on our available

believes that the nongaap financial measures provide useful supplemental information to both management and investors in understanding its underlying operational performance business and performance

equivalent basis totaling million for the second quarter decreased million as compared to the first quarter and increased million as compared to the second quarter the decrease as compared to the first quarter was mainly due to a billion increase in average interest bearing liabilities and higher interest rates on most interest bearing deposit products and shortterm borrowings partially offset by higher loan yields as a result interest expense increased million to million for the second quarter as compared to the first quarter interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased million to million in the second quarter as compared to the first quarter the increase was mostly due to higher yields on both new originations and adjustable rate loans in our portfolio and a billion increase in average loan balances driven by organic new loan volumes and a continuation of slower loan prepayments average interest earning assets increased billion to billion for the second quarter as compared to the second quarter mainly due to a billion increase in average loan balances and billion increase in average interest bearing cash balances largely due to higher excess cash held overnight as part of our prudent liquidity management navigating the fallout from the recent bank failures compared to the first quarter average interest earning assets increased by billion during the second quarter the increase was primarily driven by a billion increase in average loan balances mainly due to organic commercial loan growth and a million increase in average interest bearing cash as compared to the prior linked quarter average interest bearing liabilities increased billion to billion for the second quarter as compared to the second quarter mainly due to increases of billion and billion in average time deposits and shortterm borrowings respectively the increases in average time deposits and shortterm borrowings were largely due to the enhanced liquidity management efforts during the first half of including increased usage of fully fdicinsured indirect customer cd and successful retail cd initiatives as compared to the first quarter average interest bearing liabilities increased by billion in the second quarter largely due to a billion increase in average time deposits mainly driven by increased usage of fully fdicinsured indirect customer cd and successful retail

section above net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis of percent for the second quarter decreased by basis points and basis points from percent and percent for the first quarter and the second quarter respecti vely the decrease as compared to the first quarter was largely driven by higher interest rates on interest bearing deposits and shortterm borrowings partially offset by a basis point increase in the yield on average interest earning assets the yield on average loans increased by basis points to percent for the second quarter as compared to the first quarter largely due to higher interest rates on new originations and adjustable rate loans the yields on average taxable and nontaxable investments also increased basis points and basis points respectively from the first quarter mostly due to investment maturities and prepayments redeployed into new higher yielding securities during the first half of our cost of total average deposits increased to percent for the second quarter from percent and percent for the first quarter and the second quarter respectively the overall cost of average interest bearing liabilities also increased basis points to percent for the second quarter as compared to the first quarter primarily driven by the rising market interest rates on deposits during the first half of based upon our current estimates at june we anticipate net interest income growth in the low single digits ie less than percent for the full year of revised down fro m to percent previously estimated in the m da of valleys form 10k for the year ended december while we are seeing initial signs of stabilization in net interest income and margin as compared to the declines in both experienced in the first quarter we cannot provide any assurances with respect

recognized as a discrete event in the quarter in which it occurs rather than being recognized as a change in effective tax rate for the current year our adherence to these tax guidelines may result in volatile effective income tax rates in future quarterly and annual periods factors that could impact managements judgment include changes in income tax laws and regulations and tax planning strategies

of the automobile loans which represented percent of total loans at june is relatively unaffected by movements in the market level of interest rates however the average life may be impacted by new

insurance services division comprised of trust asset management brokerage insurance and tax credit advisory services average interest earning assets within consumer banking increased million to

interest earning assets increased million to billion for the six months ended june as compared to the same period in the increase was largely due to new residential mortgage loan volumes originated for investment rather than sale over the last 12month period as well as growth in home equity loans and secured personal lines of credit income before income taxes generated by consumer banking decreased million to million for the six months ended june as compared to the same period in mainly driven by lower net interest income and to a lesser extent increases in noninterest expense and the provision for loan losses net interest income decreased million for the six months ended june as compared to the same period in mainly due to additional interest expense generated from higher average deposit balances as well as an increase in interest rate s on such balances the provision for loan losses increased million for the six months ended june due to additional reserves related to residential loan growth and changes in the economic forecast component within our cecl model as compared to one year ago see further details in the allowance for credit losses section of this mda the negative impact of these items was partially offset by an million increase in noninterest income coupled with a million decrease in the internal transfer expense f or the six months ended june as compared to the same period in the increase in noninterest income was mainly driven by increases in wealth management and trust fees and service charges on deposit accounts net interest margin on the consumer banking portfolio decreased basis points to percent for the six months ended june as compared to the same period one year ago mainly due to a basis point increase in the costs associated with our funding sources partially offset by an basis point increase in the yield on average loans the basis point increase in loan yield was largely due to higher yielding new loan volumes and adjustable rate loans in our portfolio see the executive summary and the net interest income sections above for more details on our net interest margin and funding sources the return on average interest earning assets before income taxes for the consumer banking segment was percent for the six months ended june compared to percent as compared to the same period one year ago commercial banking average interest earning assets in commercial banking increased billion to billion for the six months ended june as compared to the same period in this increase was primarily due to strong organic loan growth especially in the commercial real estate portfolio over the 12month period ended june as well as loans acquired from bank leumi usa on april for the six months ended june income before income taxes for commercial banking increased million to million as compared to the same period in mainly due to an increase in net interest income and a lower provision for credit losses partially offset by higher noninterest expense net interest income increased million to million for the six months ended june as compared to the same period in primarily due to higher average commercial loan balances and higher interest rates on new and adjustable loans t he provision for credit losses decreased million to million during the six months ended june as compared to million for the same period in mainly due to a provision for nonpcd loans and unfunded credit commitments acquired from bank leumi in the second quarter see details in the allowance for credit losses for loans section of this mda noninterest expense increased million to million for the six months ended june as compared to the same period in mainly due to acquired and organic growth in our commercial operations see further details in the noninterest income and noninterest expense sections of this mda the net interest margin for this segment increased basis point to percent for the six months ended june as compared to

before income taxes for the commercial banking segment was percent for the six months ended june compared to percent for the same period in treasury and corporate other treasury and corporate others average interest earning assets increased billion during the six months ended june as compared to the same period in mainly due to investment securities acquired from bank leumi usa as well as other select new investment securities purchases over the last 12month period average interest bearing deposits with banks increased million as compared to the same period in due to additional cash held as a cautionary liquidity management measur e starting in march and through most of the second quarter the loss before income taxes for this segment totaled million for the six months ended june as compared to million for the same period in the million increase in pretax loss was mainly due to an increase in noninterest expense and decreases in both net interest income and internal transfer income partially offset by higher noninterest income noninterest expense increased million to million for the six months ended june as compared to the same period in largely due to expenses related to our expanded banking operations and organic business growth including higher salary and employee benefits expense technology furniture and equipment and professional and legal fees internal transfer income decreased million to million for the six months ended june as compared to the same period in due to the higher allocation of noninterest expense over the same period noninterest income increased million during the six months ended june as compared to the same period in mostly due to incremental increases in several operating noninterest income categories caused by acquired and organic growth of our business operations over the last 12month period see further details in the noninterest income and noninterest expense sections of this mda provision for credit losses increased million mainly due to a corporate bond issued by signature bank within our afs debt securities portfolio that was fully chargedoff during the first quarter treasury and corporate others net interest margin decreased basis points to percent for the six months ended june as compared to the same period in due to a basis point increase in cost of our funding sources partially offset by a basis point increase in the yield on average investments the increased yield on average investments as compared to the same period in was largely driven by new higher yielding investments and a reduction in premium amortization expense mostly caused by slower principal repayments in the rising interest rate environment assetliability management interest rate risk our success is largely dependent upon our ability to manage interest rate risk interest rate risk can be defined as the exposure of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities to the movement in interest rates our assetliability management committee is responsible for managing such risks and establishing policies that monitor and coordinate our sources and uses of funds assetliability management is a continuous process due to the constant change in interest rate risk factors in assessing the appropriate interest rate risk levels for us management weighs the potential benefit of each risk management activity within the desired parameters of liquidity capital levels and managements tolerance for exposure to income fluctuations many of the actions undertaken by management utilize fair value analysis and attempt to achieve consistent accounting and economic benefits for financial assets and their related funding sources we have predominantly focused on managing our interest rate risk by attempting to match the inherent risk and cash flows of financial assets and liabilities specifically management employs multiple risk management activities such as optimizing the level of new residential mortgage originations retained in our mortgage portfolio through increasing or decreasing loan sales in the secondary market product pricing levels the desired maturity levels for new originations the composition levels of both our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as well as several other risk management activities we use a simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity to movements in interest rates the simulation model projects net interest income based on various interest rate scenarios over a 12month and 24month period the model is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of rate sensitive assets and liabilities the model incorporates certain assumptions which management believes to be reasonable regarding the impact of changing interest rates and the prepayment assumptions of certain assets and liabilities as of june the model assumes immediate changes in interest rates without any proactive change in the composition or size of the balance sheet or other future actions that management might undertake to mitigate this risk in the model the forecasted shape of the yield curve remains static as of june the impact of interest rate derivatives such as interest rate swaps is also included in the model our simulation model is based on market interest rates and prepayment speeds prevalent in the market as of june although the size of valleys balance sheet is forecasted to remain static as of june in our model the composition is adjusted to reflect new interest earning assets and funding originations coupled with rate spreads utilizing our actual originations during the second quarter the model also utilizes an immediate parallel shift in market interest rates at june the assumptions used in the net interest income simulation are inherently uncertain actual results may differ significantly from those presented in the table below due to the frequency and timing of changes in interest rates and changes in spreads between maturity and repricing categories overall our net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates and cash flows from our loan and investment portfolios we actively manage these cash flows in conjunction with our liability mix duration and interest rates to optimize the net interest income while structuring the balance sheet in response to actual or potential changes in interest rates additionally our net interest income is impacted by the level of competition within our marketplace competition can negatively impact the level of interest rates attainable on loans and increase the cost of deposits which may result in downward pressure on our net interest margin in future periods other factors including but not limited to the slope of the yield curve and projected cash flows will impact our net interest income results and may increase or decrease the level of asset sensitivity of our balance sheet convexity is a measure of how the duration of a financial instrument changes as market interest rates change potential movements in the convexity of bonds held in our investment portfolio as well as the duration of the loan portfolio may have a positive or negative impact on our net interest income in varying interest rate environments as a result the increase or decrease in forecasted net interest income may not have a linear relationship to the results reflected in the table below management cannot provide any assurance about the actual effect of changes in interest rates on our net interest income the following table reflects managements expectations of the change in our net interest income over the next month period considering the aforementioned assumptions while an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this simulation model we believe that any actual shift in interest rates would likely be more gradual and would therefore have a more modest impact than shown in the table below estimated change in future net interest income changes in interest rates dollar change percentage change in basis points in thousands as noted in the table above a basis point immediate increase in interest rates combined with a static balance sheet where the size mix and proportions of assets and liabilities remain unchanged is projected to increase net interest income over the next 12month period by percent management believes the interest rate sensitivity of our balance sheet remains within an acceptable tolerance range at june however the level of net interest income sensitivity may increase or decrease in the future as a result of several factors including potential changes in our balance sheet strategies the slope of the yield curve and projected cash flows liquidity and cash requirements bank liquidity liquidity measures valleys ability to satisfy its current and future cash flow needs our objective is to have liquidity available to fulfill loan demands repay deposits and other liabilities and execute balance sheet strategies in all market conditions while adhering to internal controls and income targets valleys liquidity program is managed by the treasury department and routinely monitored by the asset and liability management committee and two board committees among other actions treasury actively monitors valleys current liquidity profile sources and stability of funding availability of assets for pledging or sale opportunities to gather additional funds and anticipated future funding needs including the level of unfunded commitments the bank adheres to certain internal liquidity measures including ratios of loans to deposits below percent and wholesale funding to total funding below percent as summarized in the table below management maintains flexibility to temporarily exceed these thresholds in certain operating environments the following table presents valleys loan to deposits and wholesale funding to total funding ratios at june and december june december loans to deposits wholesale funding to total funding valleys short and longterm cash requirements include contractual obligations under borrowings deposits payments related to leases capital expenditures and other purchase commitments in the ordinary course of operations the bank also enters into various financial obligations including contractual obligations that may require future cash payments management believes the bank has the ability to generate and obtain adequate amounts of cash to meet its shortterm and longterm obligations as they come due by utilizing various cash resources described below on the asset side of the balance sheet the bank has numerous sources of liquid funds in the form of cash and due from banks interest bearing deposits with banks including the federal reserve bank of new york and other sources the following table summarizes valleys sources of liquid assets june december in thousands cash and due from banks interest bearing deposits with banks trading debt securities held to maturity debt securities available for sale debt securities loans held for sale total liquid assets represents securities that are maturing within days or would otherwise qualify as maturities if sold ie percent of original cost basis has been repaid within the held to maturity debt security portfolio includes a pproximately million and million of various investment securities that were pledged to counterparties to support our earning asset funding strategies at june and december respectively total liquid assets represented percent and percent of earning assets at june and december respectively other sources of funds on the asset side are derived from scheduled loan payments of principal and interest as well as prepayments received at june estimated cash inflows from total loans are projected to be approximately billion over the next 12month period as a contingency plan for any liquidity constraints liquidity could also be derived from the sale of conforming residential mortgages from our loan portfolio or alleviated from the temporary curtail ment of lending activities we anticipate the receipt of approx imately million in principal payments from securities in the total investment portfolio at june over the next 12month period due to normally scheduled principal repayments and expected prepayments of certain securities primarily residential mortgagebacked securities on the liability side of the balance sheet we utilize multiple sources of funds to meet liquidity needs including retail and commercial deposits fully fdicinsured indirect customer deposits collateralized municipal deposits and shortterm and longterm borrowings our core deposit base which generally excludes all fully insured indirect customer deposits as well as retail certificates of deposit over thousand represents the largest of these source s average core deposits totaled approximately billion and billion for the six months ended june and for the year ended december respectively representing percent and percent of average interest earning assets for the respective periods the level of interest bearing deposits is affected by interest rates offered which is often influenced by our need for funds rates prevailing in the capital markets competition and the need to manage interest rate risk sensitivity in addition to customer deposits the bank has ample access to readily available borrowing sources available to supplement its current and projected funding needs the following table presents shortterm borrowings outstanding at june and december june december in thousands fhlb advances securities sold under agreements to repurchase total shortterm borrowings the following table summarizes the banks estimated unused available nondeposit borrowing capacities at june and december june december in thousands fhlb borrowing capacity unused frb discount window unused federal funds lines available from commercial banks unencumbered investment securities total fhlb and frb borrowings are collateralized by certain pledged securities including but not limited to us government and agency mortgagebacked securities and blanket qualifying first lien on certain real estate and residential mortgage secured loans additionally the federal reserve established the bank term funding program on march as a funding source for eligible depository institutions the program can provide shortterm liquidity up to one year against the par value of certain highquality collateral such as us treasury securities and eliminate the potential need for an institution to sell those securities in times of stress advances under the program can be requested until march this program is currently another shortterm liquidity source for valley valley had no outstanding borrowings under the program at june corporation liquidity valleys recurring cash requirements primarily consist of dividends to preferred and common shareholders and interest expense on subordinated notes and junior subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts as part of our ongoing assetliability management strategies valley could also use cash to repurchase shares of its outstanding common stock under its share repurchase program or redeem its callable junior subordinated debentures and subordinated notes including million of percent subordinated notes which are maturing on september valleys cash needs are routinely satisfied by dividends collected from the bank projected cash flows from the bank are expected to be adequate to pay preferred and common dividends if declared and interest expense payable to subordinated note holders and capital trusts given the current capital levels and current profitable operations of the bank in addition to dividends received from the bank valley can satisfy its cash requirements by utilizing its own cash and potential new funds borrowed from outside sources or capital issuances valley also has the right to defer interest payments on the junior subordinated debentures and therefore distributions on its trust preferred securities for consecutive quarterly periods of up to five years but not beyond the stated maturity dates and subject to other conditions investment securities portfolio as of june we had million billion and billion in equity available for sale debt securities and held to maturity debt securities respectively the available for sale and held to maturity debt securities portfolios which comprise the majority of the securities we own include us treasury securities us government agency securities taxexempt and taxable issuances of states and political subdivisions residential mortgagebacked securities singleissuer trust preferred securities principally issued by bank holding companies and high quality corporate bonds among other securities our available for sale debt securities include securities such as bank issued and other corporate bonds as well as municipal special revenue bonds which may pose a higher risk of future impairment charges to us as a result of the uncertain economic environment and its potential negative effect on the future performance of the security issuers the equity securities consisted of two publicly traded mutual funds cra investments and several other equity investments we have made in companies that develop new financial technologies and in partnerships that invest in such companies our cra and other equity investments are a mix of both publicly traded entities and privately held entities we also had million of trading debt securities at june consisting of us treasury securities we continually evaluate our investment securities portfolio in response to established assetliability management objectives changing market conditions that could affect profitability and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed to these evaluations may cause us to change the level of funds we deploy into investment securities change the composition of our investment securities portfolio and change the proportion of investments primarily made into the available for sale and held to maturity debt securities portfolios allowance for credit losses and impairment analysis available for sale debt securities available for sale debt securities in unrealized loss positions are evaluated for impairment related to credit losses at least quarterly in assessing whether a credit loss exists we compare the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security with the amortized cost basis of the security if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis for the security a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded limited to the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis declines in fair value that have not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses such as declines due to changes in market interest rates are recorded through other comprehensive income net of applicable taxes we have evaluated all available for sale debt securities that are in an unrealized loss position as of june and december and determined that the declines in fair value were mainly attributable to changes in market v olatility due to factors such as interest rates and spread factors but not attributable to credit quality or other factors based on a comparison of the present value of expected cash flows to the amortized cost valley recognized a credit related impairment of one corporate bond issued by signature bank resulting in both a provision for credit losses and full chargeoff of the security totaling million during the six months ended june there was no other impairment recognized within the available for sale debt securities portfolio during the three months ended june and the three and six months ended june valley does not intend to sell any of its available for sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position prior to recovery of our amortized cost basis and it is more likely than not that valley will not be required to sell any of its securities prior to recovery of our amortized cost basis none of the available for sale debt securities were past due as of june and t here was no allowance for credit losses for available for sale

characteristics include the historical lifetime probability of default and severity of loss in the event of default with the model incorporating several economic cycles of loss history data to calculate expected credit losses given default at the individual security level held to maturity debt securities were carried net of an allowance for credit losses totaling approximately million and million at june and december respectively investment grades the investment grades in the table below reflect the most current independent analysis performed by third parties of each security as of the date presented and not necessarily the investment grades at the date of our purchase of the securities for many securities the rating agencies may not have performed an independent analysis of the tranches owned by us but rather an analysis of the entire investment pool for this and other reasons we believe the assigned investment grades may not accurately reflect the actual credit quality of each security and should not be viewed in isolation as a measure of the quality of our investment portfolio the following table presents the available for sale and held to maturity debt investment

commercial real estate commercial real estate construction total commercial real estate residential mortgage consumer home equity automobile other consumer total consumer loans total loans as a percent of total loans commercial and industrial commercial real estate residential mortgage consumer loans total includes net unearned discount and deferred loan fees of million million and million at june march and december respectively total loans increased billion or percent on an annualized basis to billion at june from march mainly due to continued organic loan growth in commercial loan categories and relatively low levels of loan prepayment activity during the second quarter residential mortgage loans held for sale at fair value totaled million and million at june and march respectively at june loans held for sale also included one nonperforming construction loan totaling million net of chargeoffs transferred from the loan portfolio during the second quarter commercial and industrial loans increased million to billion at june as compared to march the organic and diverse growth was mainly a result of new loan volumes from our preexisting longterm customer base commercial real estate loans excluding construction loans increased million to billion at june from march reflecting solid organic growth mainly within nonowner occupied and multifamily loans across our geographic market areas at june commercial real estate loans collateralized by office buildings were approximately billion of the billion portfolio these loans are geographically disbursed largely across florida alabama new jersey new york and manhattan with a combined weighted average loan to value ratio of percent and debt service coverage ratio of construction loans increased only million to billion at june from march and was largely due to advances on preexisting construction loan projects in new jersey new york and florida residential mortgage loans increased million or percent on an annualized basis during the second quarter as we largely originated new loans for the held for investment portfolio rather than for sale new and refinanced residential mortgage loan originations totaled million for the second quarter as compared to million and million for the first quarter and second quarter respectively florida originations totaled million and represented percent of total residential mortgage loan originations in the quarter during the second quarter we retained approximately percent of the total residential mortgage originations in our held for investment loan portfolio of the total originations in the second quarter million of residential mortgage loans were originated for sale rather than held for investment as compared to million during the second quarter additionally the volume of both new and refinanced loan applicat ions has remained relatively low in the early stages of the third quarter due to the high level of mortgage interest rates and tight housing inventories and may challenge our ability to grow this loan category home equity loans increased by million to million at june compared to march as a result of lower new originations and line utilization in an unfavorable high interest rate environment automobile loans decreased by million or percent on an annualized basis to billion at june as compared to march largely due to continued low consumer demand for new and used vehicle financing because of the higher interest rate environment during the second quarter the interest rates on new car loans reached the highest level since we originated million in auto loans through our florida dealership network during the second quarter as compared to million in the first quarter of the total originations our florida dealership network represented approximately percent of new loans during the second quarter despite adequate new automobile inventories available to consumers we anticipate that the impact of inflation on average new vehicle prices coupled with rising interest rates could continue to have a negative impact on our ability to grow this loan category during the third quarter other consumer loans increased million to billion at june as compared to march mainly due to moderate growth in our collateralized personal lines of credit portfolio a significant part of our lendin g is in northern and central new jersey new york city long island and florida to mitigate our geographic risks we make efforts to maintain a diversified portfolio as to type of borrower and loan to guard against a potential downward turn in any one economic sector annualized loan growth slowed to percent during the second quarter from percent in the first quarter as we worked through the majority of the strong loan pipeline that was present at the beginning of we will continue to be selective on the lending side and generally supportive of compelling projects led by our high quality and tenured customer base moving forward we anticipate moderate levels of overall loan growth in the mid to high single digits on an annualized basis for the remainder of nonperforming assets nonperforming assets npa include nonaccrual loans other real estate owned oreo and other repossessed assets which primarily consist of automobiles and taxi medallions at june loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when they become past due in excess of days as to payment of principal or interest exceptions to the nonaccrual policy may be permitted if the loan is sufficiently collateralized and in the process of collection oreo is acquired through foreclosure on loans secured by land or real estate oreo and other repossessed assets are reported at lower of cost or fair value less estimated cost to sell our npas increased million to million at june as compared to march mostly due to increases in both nonaccrual commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans partially offset by decreases in construction loans and residential mortgage loans npas as a percentage of total loans and npas totaled percent and percent at june and march respectively as shown in the table below our total npas has remained relatively low as a percentage of the total loan portfolio and the level of npas which is reflective of our consistent approach to the loan underwriting criteria for both valley originated loans and loans purchased from third parties for additional details see the credit quality indicators section in note to the consolidated financial statements our lending strategy is based on underwriting standards designed to maintain high credit quality and we remain optimistic regarding the overall future performance of our loan portfolio during the six months ended june our overall credit trends have remained stable and our business and borrowers continued to demonstrate resilience and growth despite the recent challenges across the banking system slower economic growth elevated inflation and the overall uncertain economy however management cannot provide assurance that the nonperforming assets will not materially increase from the levels reported at june due to the aforementioned or other factors potentially impacting our lending customers the following table sets forth by loan category accruing past due and nonperforming assets at the dates indicated in

industrial loans to days past due decreased million mainly due to improved performance during the second quarter loans past due to days decreased million to million at june as compared to march largely due to a commercial and industrial loan relationship totaling million included in this delinquency category at march that became current to all its contractual payments at june loans days or more past due and still accruing interest decreased million to million at june as compared to march mainly due to decreases in the commercial and industrial and construction loan categories partially offset by one new matured commercial real estate loan of million expected to be paid off in the near term all loans days or more past due and still accruing interest are wellsecured and in the process of collection nonaccrual loans increased million to million at june as compared to million at march mostly driven by an increase in the commercial real estate loan category nonaccrual commercial real estate loans increased million to million at june due in part to the aforementioned migration of two loans totaling million from the to days past due delinquency category at march and one new million nonperforming loan at june nonaccrual construction loans decreased million to million at june from march primarily due to the million partial chargeoff of one loan which was transferred to loans held for sale at june although the timing of collection is uncertain management believes that the majority of the nonaccrual loans at june are well secured and largely collectible based in part on our quarterly review of collateral dependent loans and the valuation of the underlying collateral if applicable any estimated shortfall in each collateral valuation results in an allocation of specific reserves within our allowance for credit losses for loans nonperforming taxi medallion loans totaled million of the million nonaccrual commercial and industrial loans at june at june all taxi medallion loans in the loan portfolio were on nonaccrual status and had related reserves of million or percent of such loans within the allowance for loan losses potential further declines in the

consumer loans secured by residential real estate properties for which formal foreclosure proceedings are in process totale d thousand and million at june and december respectively allowance for credit losses for loans the allowance for credit losses acl for loans includes the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments under cecl our methodology to establish the allowance for loan losses has two basic components i a collective reserve component for estimated expected credit losses for pools of loans that share common risk characteristics and ii an individual reserve component for loans that do not share risk characteristics consisting of collateral dependent loans valley also maintains a separate allowance for unfunded credit commitments mainly consisting of undisbursed noncancellable lines of credit new loan commitments and commercial standby letters of credit valley estimated the collective acl using a current expected credit losses methodology which is based on relevant information about historical experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the loan balances in estimating the component of the allowance on a collective basis we use a transition matrix model which calculates an expected life of loan loss percentage for each loan pool by generating probability of default and loss given default metrics the metrics are based on the migration of loans within the commercial and industrial loan categories from performing to loss by credit quality rating or delinquency categories using historical lifeofloan analysis periods for each loan portfolio pool and the severity of loss based on the aggregate net lifetime losses the models expected losses based on loss history are adjusted for qualitative factors among other things these adjustments include and account for differences in i the impact of the reasonable and supportable economic forecast relative probability weightings and reversion period ii other asset specific risks to the extent that they do not exist in the historical loss information and iii net expected recoveries of chargedoff loan balances these adjustments are based on qualitative factors not reflected in the quantitative model but are likely to impact the measurement of estimated credit losses the expected lifetime loss rate is the life of loan loss percentage from the transition matrix model plus the impact of the adjustments for qualitative factors the expected credit losses are the product of multiplying the models expected lifetime loss rate by the exposure at default at period end on an undiscounted basis valley utilizes a twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period followed by a oneyear period over which estimated losses revert to historical loss experience for the remaining life of the loan on a straightline basis the forecasts consist of a multiscenario economic forecast model to estimate future credit losses and is governed by a crossfunctional committee the committee meets each quarter to determine which economic scenarios developed by moodys will be incorporated into the model as well as the relative probability weightings of the selected scenarios based upon all readily available information the model projects economic variables under each scenario based on detailed statistical analyses we have identified and selected key variables that most closely correlated to our historical credit performance which include gdp unemployment and the caseshiller home price index at june valley continued to maintain the majority of its probability weighting used in the economic forecast to the moodys baseline scenario with less emphasis on the s3 downside and s4 adverse scenarios however the standalone moodys baseline scenario reflected a more pessimistic outlook as compared to march in terms of gdp growth unemployment levels and potential near term negative economic impacts given the present uncertain economic conditions at june the moodys baseline forecast included the following specific assumptions gdp expansion of approximately percent in the third quarter unemployment of percent in the third quarter and to percent over the remainder of the forecast period ending in the second quarter continued concerns about increased debt burden pushed by rising interest rates high inflation and elevated house prices consumer spending remained a source of growth and its contribution grew to the largest in nearly two years as the costofliving adjusted boosted aftertax income adding another percent to growth the federal reserve opted to pause its rate hikes in june keeping the federal funds rate at percent with possible additional reductions in and inflation remains elevated but
