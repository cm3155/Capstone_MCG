affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated statements of financial condition and results of operations for the periods indicated at september we identified our policies on the allowance for credit losses goodwill and other intangible assets and income taxes to be critical accounting policies because management has to make subjective andor complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions management has reviewed the application of these policies and estimates with the audit committee of valleys board of directors our critical accounting policies and estimates are described in detail in part ii item in valleys annual report on form 10k for the year ended december and there have been no material changes in such policies and estimates since the date of such report new authoritative

and total shareholders equity of billion valley operates many convenient branch office locations and commercial banking offices in northern and central new jersey the new york city boroughs of manhattan brooklyn and queens long island westchester county new york florida california alabama and illinois of our current branch network percent percent and percent of the branches are in new jersey new york and florida respectively with the remaining percent of the branches in alabama california and illinois combined we have grown significantly both in asset size and locations over the past several years through organic efforts and bank acquisitions including our acquisition of bank leumi usa on april as originally planned valley completed its conversion of the legacy valley and bank leumi usa operating systems to a single core operating system in october industry developments the combination of rapidly rising interest rates increased competition and economic uncertainty continues to weigh on the banking industry we have consistently operated the bank with a focus on diversification to maintain stability through various economic cycles during the third quarter we continued to position our balance sheet to mitigate potential risks from the market uncertainty affecting the banking industry in general and valley its clients and communities in particular total assets decreased million or percent to billion at september from june largely driven by lower excess cash liquidity maintained overnight on our balance sheet our liquid assets totaled billion at september representing percent of interest earning assets we continue to maintain significant access to readily available diverse funding sources to fulfill both shortterm and longterm funding needs see the bank liquidity section for additional information total deposits increased million to billion at september as compared to billion at june largely due to increases in direct customer interest bearing deposits partially offset by a net decrease of million in indirect customer deposits driven by maturity of certain brokered cds see the deposits and other borrowings section for more details capital remained strong with ratios of both valley and the bank exceeding all capital adequacy requirements at september total shareholders equity increased million to billion at september as compared to june see the capital adequacy section for additional details total loans increased million or percent on an annualized basis to billion at september from june mainly due to select organic commercial real estate loan growth during the third quarter see the loan portfolio section for more information asset quality continued to reflect our disciplined underwriting and lending practices during the third quarter nonperforming assets npas as a percentage of total loans and npas totaled percent and percent at september and june respectively see the nonperforming assets section for additional information total investment securities were billion or percent of total assets at september and remained relatively unchanged as compared to june see the investment securities portfolio section for more details quarterly results net income for the third quarter was million or per diluted common share as compared to million or per diluted common share for the third quarter the million decrease in quarterly net income as compared to the same quarter one year ago was mainly due to the following changes a million decrease in net interest income as higher yields on both new loan originations and adjustablerate loans were more than offset by an increase in the cost of deposits a million increase in our provision for credit losses and a million increase in noninterest exp ense was due in part to a higher salary and employee benefits expense an fdic insurance assessment and charges for collateral liabilities related to derivative transactions which were partially offset by a million increase in noninterest income that was primarily driven by net gains on sales of assets and higher wealth management and trust fees partially offset by lower capital markets income and a million decrease in income tax expense mostly due to lower pretax income in the third quarter see the net interest income noninterest income noninterest expense and income taxes sections below for more details on the impact of the items above on our third quarter results us economic conditions during the third quarter real gross domestic product gdp increased at an annual rate of percent as compared to an increase of percent during the second quarter the percent increase in real gdp reflected accelerated economic growth fueled by continued robust consumer spending private inventory investment nonresidential fixed investment and government spending inflation moderately cooled but remained at percent in the third quarter during each of may and july the federal reserve raised the target range for the federal funds rate by an additional basis points which resulted in a current target range of to percent the federal reserve paused rate increases in august september and november largely to observe the full impact of its significant rate hikes since the beginning of the 10year us treasury note yield ended the third quarter at percent or basis points higher as compared to the second quarter and the 2year us treasury note yield ended the third quarter at percent or basis points higher as compared to the second quarter us commercial banks saw commercial and industrial loans remain relatively unchanged with minimal growth from june to september overall commercial real estate lending continued to be stressed particularly affecting regional and midsize banks that may be overexposed to office space l ending in light of higher uncertainty inflated property prices and concerns about debt repayments most banks have become more selective in their new commercial real estate originations additionally the combination of high interest rates and tight inventories have kept residential real estate sales and both refinanced and purchased residential mortgage loan activity low during the third quarter despite strong economic growth during the third quarter the following factors have added a higher level of uncertainty to the future path of the us economy and created a challenging operating environment for the banking sector including elevated inflation the potential for additional fallout from the recent banking crisis including bank regulatory actions the inverted yield curve and potential further increases in market interest rates in addition geopolitical tensions in the middle east which could threaten a spike in oil prices and a possibility of the government shutdown among other factors have added a higher level of uncertainty to the future path of the us economy and created a challenging banking environment should these economic conditions further deteriorate causing business activity spending and investment to decline it may adversely impact our financial results as highlighted in this mda deposits and other borrowings overall average deposits increased by billion to billion for the third quarter as compared to the second quarter mostly due to a billion increase in average time deposits partially offset by a decrease in average noninterest bearing deposits the increase in time deposits was mainly driven by successful retail cd generation and increased utilization of fully insured indirect customer ie brokered deposits the decline in average noninterest bearing deposits was largely due to a shift in customer balances to our interest bearing deposit products in a rising interest rate environment outflows due to attractive investment alternatives to deposits in the marketplace and customer use of cash reserves in place of financing average noninterestbearing deposits savings now and money market deposits and time deposits represented approximately percent percent and percent of total deposits as of september respectively actual ending balances for deposits increased million to billion at september from june mainly due to increases of million in savings now and money market deposits and million in time deposits partially offset by a million decrease in noninterest bearing deposits the increase in savings now and money market deposits was largely driven by increases in digital and national specialized deposits as well as some shift in customer balances from noninterest bearing deposits during the third quarter the increase in time deposits was largely due to successful retail deposit campaigns partially offset by the maturity of indirect customer deposits noninterest bearing balances continued to be challenged by the high level of market interest rates and the aforementioned changes in customer behavior at september noninterest bearing deposits savings now and money market deposits and time deposits represented approximately percent percent and percent of total deposits as of september respectively as compared to percent percent and percent of total deposits as of june respectively the following table lists by maturity uninsured certificates of deposit at september in thousands less than three months three to six months six to twelve months more than twelve months total total estimated uninsured deposits excluding collateralized government deposits and intercompany deposits ie deposits eliminated in consolidation totaled approximately billion or percent of total deposits at september as compared to billion or percent of total deposits at june while our diversified commercial and consumer deposit base has remained relatively stable during the early stages of the fourth quarter deposit gathering initiatives could remain challenging due to market competition attractive investment alternatives such as us treasury securities and other factors as a result we cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain deposit levels at or near those reported at september the following table presents average shortterm and longterm borrowings for the periods indicated three months ended nine months ended september june september september september in thousands average shortterm borrowings fhlb advances securities sold under repurchase agreements federal funds purchased total average longterm borrowings fhlb advances subordinated debt junior subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts total average shortterm borrowings decreased billion during the third quarter as compared to the second quarter mostly due to the maturity and repayment of several fhlb advances as we trimmed our elevated excess liquidity position during the third quarter average longterm borrowings including junior subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts which are presented separately on the consolidated statements of financial condition moderately increased million as compared to the second quarter mostly due to new fhlb advances issued in the second quarter actual ending balances for shortterm borrowings decreased billion to million at september as compared to june mainly due to the aforementioned maturities of fhlb advances and the decrease in our excess overnight cash positions as part of our liquidity management strategies during the third quarter longterm borrowings totaled billion at september as compared to billion at june the decrease was largely due to the maturity and repayment of million of percent subordinated notes issued in september and due on september which had already been fully disallowed from a regulatory capital perspective nongaap financial measures the table below presents selected performance indicators their comparative nongaap measures and the nongaap efficiency ratio for the periods indicated valley believes that the nongaap financial measures provide useful supplemental information to both management

million for the third quarter decreased million and million as compared to the second quarter and third quarter respectively the decrease as compared to the second quarter was mainly due to increased

interest expense increased million to million for the third quarter as compared to the second quarter interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased million to million in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter the increase was mostly due to higher yields on both new originations and adjustable rate loans in our portfolio and a million increase in average loan balances driven by organic new loan volumes over the last six months and a continuation of slower loan prepayments in the third quarter average interest earning assets increased billion to billion for the third quarter as compared to the third quarter mainly due to a billion increase in average loan balances and a million increase in average interest bearing cash balances largely due to higher excess cash held overnight as part of our prudent liquidity management navigating the fallout from the bank failures in the first half of compared to the second quarter average interest earning assets decreased

million increase in average loan balances mainly due to continued growth in the commercial real estate loan portfolio average interest bearing liabilities increased billion to billion for the third quarter as compared to the third quarter mainly due to increases of billion and billion in average time deposits and longterm borrowings respectively partially offset by a decrease of million in average shortterm borrowings the increases in average time deposits and longterm borrowings were largely due to the enhanced liquidity management efforts during the first nine months of including increased usage of fully fdicinsured indirect customer cd and successful retail cd initiatives as compared to the second quarter average interest bearing liabilities decreased by million for the third quarter primarily due to the lower utilization of shortterm fhlb advances largely offset by higher average interest bearing deposit levels largely driven by successful retail cd generation and

section above net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis of percent for the third quarter decreased by basis points and basis points from percent and percent for the second quarter and third quarter respecti vely the decrease as compared to the second quarter was largely driven by higher interest rates on interest bearing deposits partially offset by a basis point increase in the yield on average interest earning assets the yield on average loans increased by basis points to percent for the third quarter as compared to the second quarter largely due to higher interest rates on new originations and adjustable rate loans our cost of total average deposits was percent for the third quarter as compared to percent and percent for the second quarter and the third quarter respectively the overall cost of average interest bearing liabilities also increased basis points to percent for the third quarter as compared to the second quarter primarily driven by the continued rise in the market interest rates on deposit s we anticipate our net interest income for the fourth quarter to be relatively unchanged from the third quarter while we are optimistic regarding the signs of stabilization in our net interest income during the third quarter as compared to the first six months of we cannot provide any assurances with respect to the future impact of the market interest rate

wayne new jersey in the third quarter net gains on sales of loans increased million and decreased million for the three and nine months ended september respectively as compared to the same periods in the decrease for the nine months ended september was mostly due to lower loan sale volumes as we continued to retain a higher percentage of new loan volumes during the first nine months of during the nine months ended september we sold million of residential mortgage loans as compared to million for same period in our ability to generate net gains on sales of loans could continue to be challenged by a number of factors including higher market interest rates lower customer demand for conforming loan products and our decision to originate certain residential mortgage loans for investment in our loan portfolio rather than sale other noninterest income increased million for the nine months ended september as compared to the same period in the increase for the nine months ended september was

to third quarter the increase was largely due to higher salary expense and insurance costs partially offset by a decrease in commission expense mainly related to our home mortgage consultant teams the increase for the nine months ended september was primarily driven by i higher headcount from the bank leumi usa acquisition and organic growth in our operations ii million of restructuring charges consisting of severance expense related to recent workforce reductions and iii inflationary pressures on our overall labor costs these increases were partially offset by lower cash incentive compensation expense and merger related costs merger related costs totaled million and million for the nine months ended september and respectively net occupancy expense decreased million and

expenses related to the bank leumi usa acquisition totaled million for the nine months ended september other noninterest expense increased million and million for the three and nine months ended september respectively as compared to the same periods in primarily due to general increases in several categories caused by our acquired and organic growth in operations higher charitable contributions and increased charges related to collateral liabilities in connection with derivative transactions we continuously monitor and closely manage our noninterest expense in an effort to optimize our operating efficiency we began the implementation of a new cost saving initiative in late june the identified cost savings are expected to primarily come from workforce reductions more efficient thirdparty consulting and service usage and certain technology cost reductions including those resulting from the completion of our core operating system conversion in october benefits began to be realized in the third quarter of with the initiative expected to generate more than million of annual pretax cost savings by mid2024 income taxes income tax expense totaled million for the third quarter as compared to million and million for the second quarter and third quarter respectively our effective tax rate was percent percent and percent for the third quarter second quarter and third quarter respectively the increase in the effective tax rate from the second quarter was primarily due to the release of certain state valuation allowances in the second quarter us gaap requires that any change in judgment or change in measurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period be recognized as a discrete event in the quarter in which it occurs rather than being recognized as a change in effective tax rate for the current year our adherence to these tax guidelines may result in volatile effective income tax rates in future quarterly and annual periods factors that could impact managements judgment include changes in income tax laws and regulations and tax planning strategies operating segments valley manages its business operations under operating segments consisting

banking segment represented percent of our loan portfolio at september and was mainly comprised of residential mortgage loans and automobile loans and to a lesser extent home equity loans secured personal lines of credit and other consumer loans including credit card loans the duration of the residential mortgage loan portfolio which represented percent of our loan portfolio at september is subject to movements in the market level of interest rates and forecasted prepayment speeds the weighted average life of the automobile loans which represented percent of total loans at september is relatively unaffected by movements in the market level of interest rates however the average life may be impacted by new loans as a result of the availability of credit within the automobile marketplace and consumer demand for purchasing new or used automobiles consumer banking also includes the wealth management and insurance services division comprised of trust asset management brokerage insurance and tax credit advisory services average interest earning assets within consumer banking increased million to billion for the three months ended september as compared to the same period of the increase was largely due to new residential mortgage loan volumes originated for investment rather than sale over the last 12month period and to a lesser extent growth in home equity and secured personal lines of credit income before income taxes for consumer banking decreased million to million for the third quarter as compared to the third quarter the decrease was mainly driven by lower net interest income partially offset by lower provision for credit losses and decrease in noninterest expense net interest income decreased million in the third quarter as compared to the same period of due to additional interest expense generated from the higher cost of average deposit and other borrowing as well as an increase in the average balance of these interest bearing liabilities the provision for loan losses decreased million for the three months ended september due in part to a decline in reserves related to quarterly loan growth and a decrease in noneconomic qualitative

the third quarter see further details in the noninterest income and noninterest expense sections of this mda net interest margin on the consumer banking portfolio decreased basis points to percent for the third quarter as compared to the third quarter mainly due to a basis point increase in the costs associated with our funding sou rces partially offset by an basis point increase in the yield on average loans the increase in our funding costs was mainly driven by higher interest rates on most of our interest bearing commercial and retail deposit products increased utilization of fully fdicinsured indirect customer deposits and higher cost of other borrowings held during the third quarter the basis point increase in loan yield was largely due to higher yielding new loan volumes and adjustable rate loans in our portfolio see the executive summary and the net interest income sections above for more details on our net interest margin and funding sources the return on average

credit losses for loans section of this mda internal transfer expense increased million to million for the three months ended september as compared to the third quarter noninterest income decreased million to million for the three months ended september as compared to the third quarter mainly due to a decline in the volume of interest rate swap transactions executed for commercial loan customers the negative impact of the above items was partially offset by higher net interest income net interest income for this segment increased million to million for the third quarter as compared to the same period in primarily due to both higher average commercial loan balances and interest rates on new and adjustable loans the net interest margin for this segment decreased basis poin ts to percent for the third quarter as compared to the third quarter due to a basis point increase in the cost of our funding sources partially offset by a basis point increase in the yield on average loans the

levels by september for the three months ended september loss before income taxes totaled million compared to million for the same period in the million increase in the pretax loss during the third quarter was mainly due to lower net interest income and higher noninterest expense partially offset by increases in the internal transfer income and noninterest income the internal transfer income

increased million to million during the three months ended september as compared to the same period in largely due to general increases in several categories caused by our acquired and organic growth in operations see further details in the noninterest income and noninterest expense sections of this mda the net interest margin for treasury and corporate other decreased basis points to percent for the third quarter as compared to the third quarter due to a basis point increase in cost of our funding sources partially offset by a basis point increase in the yield on average investments the increase in the yield on average investments as compared to the same period a year ago was largely driven by new higher yielding investments and a reduction in premium amortization expense mostly caused by slower principal repayments in the rising interest rate environment the following tables present the financial data for valleys operating segments and treasury and corporate other for the

interest earning assets income loss before income taxes annualized return on average interest earning assets before tax consumer banking segment the consumer banking segments average interest earning assets increased million to billion for the nine months ended september as compared to the same period in the increase was largely due to new residential mortgage loan volumes originated for investment rather than sale over the last 12month period as well as growth in home equity loans and secured personal lines of credit income before income taxes generated by consumer banking decreased million to million for the nine months ended september as compared to the same period in the decrease was mainly driven by lower net interest income net interest income decreased million for the nine months ended september as compared to the same period in mainly due to additional interest expense generated from higher average deposit balances as well as an increase in interest rate s on such balances the negative impact of these items was partially offset by an million increase in noninterest income coupled with a lower provision for loan losses and internal transfer expense the increase in noninterest income was mainly driven by increases in wealth management and trust fees and service charges on deposit accounts the provision for loan losses decreased million for the nine months ended september mainl y due to a decrease in noneconomic qualitative factors within our cecl model as compared to the same period in see further details in the allowance for credit losses section of this mda net interest margin on the consumer banking portfolio decreased basis points to percent for the nine months ended september as compared to the same period in mainly due to a basis point increase in the costs associated with our funding sources partially offset by an basis point increase in the yield on average loans the basis point increase in loan yield was largely due to higher yielding new loan volumes and adjustable rate loans in our portfolio see the executive summary and the net interest income sections above for more details on our net interest margin and funding sources the return on average interest earning assets before income taxes for the consumer banking segment was percent for the nine months ended september compared to percent for the same period in commercial banking segment average interest earning assets in the commercial banking segment increased billion to billion for the nine months ended september as compared to the same period in this increase was primarily due to organic loan growth especially in the commercial real estate portfolio over the 12month period ended september as well as average balances related to loans acquired from bank leumi usa on april for the nine months ended september income before income taxes for commercial banking increased million to million as compared to the same period in mainly due to an increase in net interest income and lower provision for credit losses partially offset by higher noninterest expense and lower noninterest income net interest income increased million to billion for the nine months ended september as compared to the same period in primarily due to higher average commercial loan balances and higher interest rates on new and adjustable loans t he provision for credit losses

from bank leumi in the second quarter see details in the allowance for credit losses for loans section of this mda noninterest expense increased million to million for the nine months ended september as compared to the same period in mainly due to acquired and organic growth in our commercial operations see further details in the noninterest income and noninterest expense sections of this mda the net interest margin for this segment decreased basis point to percent for the nine months ended september as compared to the same period in due to a basis point increase in the cost of our funding

investment securities over the last 12month period average interest bearing deposits with banks increased million for the nine months ended september as compared to the same period in due to additional cash held as a cautionary liquidity management measur e from march and through a portion of the third quarter the loss before income taxes totaled million for the nine months ended september as compared to million for the same period in the million increase in pretax loss was mainly due to decreases in both net interest income and internal transfer income combined with an increase in noninterest expense partially offse t by higher noninterest income noninterest expense increased million to million for the nine months ended september as compared to the same period in largely due to expenses related to our expanded banking operations and organic business growth including higher salary and employee benefits expense technology furniture and equipment and professional and legal fees internal transfer income decreased million to million for the nine months ended september as compared to the same period in due to lower allocations of the overhead expense to the consumer banking and commercial banking segments over the same period noninterest income increased million during t he nine months ended september as compared to the same period in mostly due to incremental increases in several operating noninterest income categories caused by acquired and organic growth of our business operations over the last 12month period see further details in the noninterest income and noninterest expense sections of this mda provision for credit losses increased million mainly due to a corporate bond issued by one failed bank within our afs debt securities portfolio that was fully chargedoff during the first quarter treasury and corporate others net interest margin decreased basis points to percent for the nine months ended september as compared to the

compared to the same period in was largely driven by new higher yielding investments and a reduction in premium amortization expense mostly caused by slower principal repayments in the rising interest rate environment assetliability management interest rate risk our success is largely dependent upon our ability to manage interest rate risk interest rate risk can be defined as the exposure of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities to the movement in interest rates our assetliability management committee is responsible for managing such risks and establishing policies that monitor and coordinate our sources and uses of funds assetliability management is a continuous process due to the constant change in interest rate risk factors in assessing the appropriate interest rate risk levels for us management weighs the potential benefit of each risk management activity within the desired parameters of liquidity capital levels and managements tolerance for exposure to income fluctuations many of the actions undertaken by management utilize fair value analysis and attempt to achieve consistent accounting and economic benefits for financial assets and their related funding sources we have predominantly focused on managing our interest rate risk by attempting to match the inherent risk and cash flows of financial assets and liabilities specifically management employs multiple risk management activities such as optimizing the level of new residential mortgage originations retained in our mortgage portfolio through increasing or decreasing loan sales in the secondary market product pricing levels the desired maturity levels for new originations the composition levels of both our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as well as several other risk management activities we use a simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity to movements in interest rates the simulation model projects net interest income based on various interest rate scenarios over a 12month and 24month period the model is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of rate sensitive assets and liabilities the model incorporates certain assumptions which management believes to be reasonable regarding the impact of changing interest rates and the prepayment assumptions of certain assets and liabilities as of september the model assumes immediate changes in interest rates without any proactive change in the composition or size of the balance sheet or other future actions that management might undertake to mitigate this risk in the model the forecasted shape of the yield curve remains static as of september the impact of interest rate derivatives such as interest rate swaps is also included in the model our simulation model is based on market interest rates and prepayment speeds prevalent in the market as of september although the size of valleys balance sheet is forecasted to remain static as of september in our model the composition is adjusted to reflect new interest earning assets and funding originations coupled with rate spreads utilizing our actual originations during the third quarter the model also utilizes an immediate parallel shift in market interest rates at september the assumptions used in the net interest income simulation are inherently uncertain actual results may differ significantly from those presented in the table below due to the frequency and timing of changes in interest rates and changes in spreads between maturity and repricing categories overall our net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates and cash flows from our loan and investment portfolios we actively manage these cash flows in conjunction with our liability mix duration and interest rates to optimize the net interest income while structuring the balance sheet in response to actual or potential changes in interest rates additionally our net interest income is impacted by the level of competition within our marketplace competition can negatively impact the level of interest rates attainable on loans and increase the cost of deposits which may result in downward pressure on our net interest margin in future periods other factors including but not limited to the slope of the yield curve and projected cash flows will impact our net interest income results and may increase or decrease the level of asset sensitivity of our balance sheet convexity is a measure of how the duration of a financial instrument changes as market interest rates change potential movements in the convexity of bonds held in our investment portfolio as well as the duration of the loan portfolio may have a positive or negative impact on our net interest income in varying interest rate environments as a result the increase or decrease in forecasted net interest income may not have a linear relationship to the results reflected in the table below management cannot provide any assurance about the actual effect of changes in interest rates on our net interest income the following table reflects managements expectations of the change in our net interest income over the next month period considering the aforementioned assumptions while an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this simulation model we believe that any actual shift in interest rates would likely be more gradual and would therefore have a more modest impact than shown in the table below estimated change in future net interest income changes in interest rates dollar change percentage change in basis points in thousands as noted in the table above a basis point immediate increase in interest rates combined with a static balance sheet where the size mix and proportions of assets and liabilities remain unchanged is projected to increase net interest income over the next 12month period by percent management believes the interest rate sensitivity of our balance sheet remains within an acceptable tolerance range at september however the level of net interest income sensitivity may increase or decrease in the future as a result of several factors including potential changes in our balance sheet strategies the slope of the yield curve and projected cash flows liquidity and cash requirements bank liquidity liquidity measures valleys ability to satisfy its current and future cash flow needs our objective is to have liquidity available to fulfill loan demands repay deposits and other liabilities and execute balance sheet strategies in all market conditions while adhering to internal controls and income targets valleys liquidity program is managed by the treasury department and routinely monitored by the asset and liability management committee and two board committees among other actions treasury actively monitors valleys current liquidity profile sources and stability of funding availability of assets for pledging or sale opportunities to gather additional funds and anticipated future funding needs including the level of unfunded commitments the bank adheres to certain internal liquidity measures including ratios of loans to deposits below percent and wholesale funding to total funding below percent as summarized in the table below management maintains flexibility to temporarily exceed these thresholds in certain operating environments the following table presents valleys loan to deposits and wholesale funding to total funding ratios at september and december september december loans to deposits wholesale funding to total funding valleys short and longterm cash requirements include contractual obligations under borrowings deposits payments related to leases capital expenditures and other purchase commitments in the ordinary course of operations the bank also enters into various financial obligations including contractual obligations that may require future cash payments management believes the bank has the ability to generate and obtain adequate amounts of cash to meet its shortterm and longterm obligations as they come due by utilizing various cash resources described below on the asset side of the balance sheet the bank has numerous sources of liquid funds in the form of cash and due from banks interest bearing deposits with banks including the federal reserve bank of new york and other sources the following table summarizes valleys sources of liquid assets september december in thousands cash and due from banks interest bearing deposits with banks trading debt securities held to maturity debt securities available for sale debt securities loans held for sale total liquid assets represents securities that are maturing within days or would otherwise qualify as maturities if sold ie percent of original cost basis has been repaid within the held to maturity debt security portfolio includes a pproximately million and million of various investment securities that were pledged to counterparties to support our earning asset funding strategies at september and december respectively total liquid assets represented percent of interest earning assets at both september and december other sources of funds on the asset side are derived from scheduled loan payments of principal and interest as well as prepayments received at september estimated cash inflows from total loans are projected to be approximately billion over the next 12month period as a contingency plan for any liquidity constraints liquidity could also be derived from the sale of conforming residential mortgages from our loan portfolio or alleviated from the temporary curtail ment of lending activities we anticipate the receipt of approx imately million in principal payments from securities in the total investment portfolio at september over the next 12month period due to normally scheduled principal repayments and expected prepayments of certain securities primarily residential mortgagebacked securities on the liability side of the balance sheet we utilize multiple sources of funds to meet liquidity needs including retail and commercial deposits fully fdicinsured indirect customer deposits collateralized municipal deposits and shortterm and longterm borrowings our core deposit base which generally excludes all fully insured indirect customer deposits as well as retail certificates of deposit over thousand represents the largest of these source s average core deposits totaled approximately billion and billion for the nine months ended september and for the year ended december respectively representing percent and percent of average interest earning assets for the respective periods the level of interest bearing deposits is affected by interest rates offered which is often influenced by our need for funds rates prevailing in the capital markets competition and the need to manage interest rate risk sensitivity in addition to customer deposits the bank has ample access to readily available borrowing sources available to supplement its current and projected funding needs the following table presents shortterm borrowings outstanding at september and december september december in thousands fhlb advances securities sold under agreements to repurchase total shortterm borrowings the following table summarizes the banks estimated unused available nondeposit borrowing capacities at september and december september december in thousands fhlb borrowing capacity unused frb discount window unused federal funds lines available from commercial banks unencumbered investment securities total fhlb and frb borrowings are collateralized by certain pledged securities including but not limited to us government and agency mortgagebacked securities and blanket qualifying first lien on certain real estate and residential mortgage secured loans additionally the federal reserve established the bank term funding program on march as a funding source for eligible depository institutions the program can provide shortterm liquidity up to one year against the par value of certain highquality collateral such as us treasury securities and eliminate the potential need for an institution to sell those securities in times of stress advances under the program can be requested until march this program is currently another shortterm liquidity source for valley valley had no outstanding borrowings under the program at september corporation liquidity valleys recurring cash requirements primarily consist of dividends to preferred and common shareholders and interest expense on subordinated notes and junior subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts as part of our ongoing assetliability management strategies valley could also use cash to repurchase shares of its outstanding common stock under its share repurchase program or redeem its callable junior subordinated debentures and subordinated notes including million of percent subordinated notes which matured on september valleys cash needs are routinely satisfied by dividends collected from the bank projected cash flows from the bank are expected to be adequate to pay preferred and common dividends if declared and interest expense payable to subordinated note holders and capital trusts given the current capital levels and current profitable operations of the bank in addition to dividends received from the bank valley can satisfy its cash requirements by utilizing its own cash and potential new funds borrowed from outside sources or capital issuances valley also has the right to defer interest payments on the junior subordinated debentures and therefore distributions on its trust preferred securities for consecutive quarterly periods of up to five years but not beyond the stated maturity dates and subject to other conditions investment securities portfolio as of september we had million billion and billion in equity available for sale debt securities and held to maturity debt securities respectively the available for sale and held to maturity debt securities portfolios which comprise the majority of the securities we own include us treasury securities us government agency securities taxexempt and taxable issuances of states and political subdivisions residential mortgagebacked securities singleissuer trust preferred securities principally issued by bank holding companies and high quality corporate bonds among other securities our available for sale debt securities include securities such as bank issued and other corporate bonds as well as municipal special revenue bonds which may pose a higher risk of future impairment charges to us as a result of the uncertain economic environment and its potential negative effect on the future performance of the security issuers the equity securities consisted of two publicly traded mutual funds cra investments and several other equity investments we have made in companies that develop new financial technologies and in partnerships that invest in such companies our cra and other equity investments are a mix of both publicly traded entities and privately held entities we also had million of trading debt securities at september consisting of us treasury securities we continually evaluate our investment securities portfolio in response to established assetliability management objectives changing market conditions that could affect profitability and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed these evaluations may cause us to change the level of funds we deploy into investment securities change the composition of our investment securities portfolio and change the proportion of investments primarily made into the available for sale and held to maturity debt securities portfolios allowance for credit losses and impairment analysis available for sale debt securities available for sale debt securities in unrealized loss positions are evaluated for impairment related to credit losses at least quarterly in assessing whether a credit loss exists we compare the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security with the amortized cost basis of the security if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis for the security a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded limited to the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis declines in fair value that have not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses such as declines due to changes in market interest rates are recorded through other comprehensive income net of applicable taxes we have evaluated all available for sale debt securities that are in an unrealized loss position as of september and december and determined that the declines in fair value were mainly attributable to changes in market v olatility due to factors such as interest rates and spread factors but not attributable to credit quality or other factors based on a comparison of the present value of expected cash flows to the amortized cost valley recognized a credit related impairment of one corporate bond issued by signature bank resulting in both a provision for credit losses and full chargeoff of the security totaling million during the nine months ended september there was no other impairment recognized within the available for sale debt securities portfolio during the three months ended september and the three and nine months ended september valley does not intend to sell any of its available for sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position prior to recovery of our amortized cost basis and it is more likely than not that valley will not be required to sell any of its securities prior to recovery of our amortized cost basis none of the available for sale debt securities were past due as of september and there was no allowance for credit losses for available for sale debt securities at september and december held to maturity debt securities valley estimates the expected credit losses on held to maturity debt securities that have loss expectations using a discounted cash flow model developed by a third party valley has a zeroloss expectation for certain securities within the held to maturity portfolio including us treasury securities us agency securities residential mortgagebacked securities issued by ginnie mae fannie mae and freddie mac and collateralized municipal bonds to measure the expected credit losses on held to maturity debt securities that have loss expectations valley estimates the expected credit losses using a discounted cash flow model developed by a third party assumptions used in the model for pools of securities with common risk characteristics include the historical lifetime probability of default and severity of loss in the event of default with the model incorporating several economic cycles of loss history data to calculate expected credit losses given default at the individual security level held to maturity debt securities were carried net of an allowance for credit losses totaling approximately million and million at september and december respectively investment grades the investment grades in the table below reflect the most current independent analysis performed by third parties of each security as of the date presented and not necessarily the investment grades at the date of our purchase of the securities for many securities the rating agencies may not have performed an independent analysis of the tranches owned by us but rather an analysis of the entire investment pool for this and other reasons we believe the assigned investment grades may not accurately reflect the actual credit quality of each security and should not be viewed in isolation as a measure of the quality of our investment portfolio the following table presents the available for sale and held to maturity debt investment securities portfolios by investment grades at september september amortized cost gross unrealized gains gross unrealized losses fair value in thousands

a a and a split rated securities with two ratings are categorized at the higher of the rating levels the unrealized losses in the aaa and aa rated categories of both the available for sale and held to maturity debt securities portfolios in the above table were largely related to residential mortgagebacked securities issued by ginnie mae fannie mae and freddie mac and continued to be driven by the rising interest rate environment during the last months the investment securities available for sale and held to maturity portfolio included million and million respectively of investments not rated by the rating agencies with aggregate unrealized losses of million and million respectively at september the unrealized losses within nonrated available for sale debt securities mostly related to several large corporate bonds negatively impacted by rising interest rates and not changes in underlying credit the unrealized losses within nonrated held to maturity debt securities mostly related to four singleissuer bank trust preferred issuances with a combined amortized cost of million and several corporate and other debt securities see note to the consolidated financial statements for

total consumer loans total loans as a percent of total loans commercial and industrial commercial real estate residential mortgage consumer loans total includes net unearned discount and deferred loan fees of million million and million at september june and december respectively total loans increased million or percent on an annualized basis to billion at september from june mainly as a result of select new loan originations in the commercial real estate loan portfolio loans held for sale at fair value presented separately from total loans on the consolidated statements of financial condition totaled million and million at september and june respect ively commercial real estate loans excluding construction loans increased million to billion at september from june reflecting new originations mainly within nonowner occupied and multifamily loans across our geographic market areas at september commercial real estate loans collateralized by office buildings were approximately billion of the billion portfolio these loans are geographically disbursed largely across florida alabama new jersey new york and manhattan with a combined weighted average loan to value ratio of percent and debt service coverage ratio of the majority of the office space loans are multitenant with no recent chargeoffs construction loans increased only million to billion at september from june due to minimal advances on preexisting construction loan projects and highly selective underwriting of new projects during the third quarter residential mortgage loans remained relatively unchanged at september from june new and refinanced residential mortgage loan originations totaled million for the third quarter as compared to million and million for the second quarter and third quarter respectively during the third quarter we retained approximately percent of the total residential mortgage originations in our held for investment loan portfo lio additionally the volume of primarily new loan applications has continued to be relatively low in the early stages of the fourth quarter largely due to the higher level of mortgage interest rates and this may continue to challenge our ability to grow this loan category home equity loans increased by million to million at september compared to june largely due to moderate increases in preexisting line utilization while new home equity loan originations remain challenged due to the unfavorable high interest rate environment automobile loans decreased by million or percent on an annualized basis to billion at september as compared to june as a moderate uptick in new indirect auto loan volumes from our dealership network did not keep pace with the portfolio repayment activity during the third quarter we anticipate that the impact of inflation on average new and used vehicle prices coupled with high market interest rates could deter consumer demand and continue to have a negative impact on our ability to grow this loan category during the fourth quarter other consumer loans decreased million to billion at september as compared to june as demand and utilization of collateralized personal lines of credit slowed during the third quarter a significant part of our lendin g is in northern and central new jersey new york city long island and florida to mitigate our geographic risks we make efforts to maintain a diversified portfolio as to type of borrower and loan to guard against a potential downward turn in any one economic sector annualized loan growth slowed to percent for the third quarter from percent in the second quarter largely as expected mostly due to the impact of higher market interest rates annualized loan growth for the nine months ended september totaled percent we remain selective on new loan originations and generally supportive of compelling projects led by our high quality and tenured customer base moving forward we anticipate loan growth in the fourth quarter to approximate the linked quarter level experienced in the third quarter nonperforming assets nonperforming assets npas include nonaccrual loans other real estate owned oreo and other repossessed assets which primarily consist of automobiles and taxi medallions at september loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when they become past due in excess of days as to payment of principal or interest exceptions to the nonaccrual policy may be permitted if the loan is sufficiently collateralized and in the process of collection oreo is acquired through foreclosure on loans secured by land or real estate oreo and other repossessed assets are reported at lower of cost or fair value less estimated cost to sell our npas increased million to million at september as compared to june mostly driven by an increase in nonaccrual commercial and industrial loans npas as a pe rcentage of total loans and npas totaled percent and percent at september and june respectively as shown in the table below our total npas has remained relatively low as a percen tage of the total loan portfolio and the level of npas which is reflective of our consistent approach to the loan underwriting criteria for both valley originated loans and loans purchased from third parties for additional details see the credit quality indicators section in note to the consolidated financial statements our lending strategy is based on underwriting standards designed to maintain high credit quality and we remain optimistic regarding the overall future performance of our loan portfolio during the nine months ended september our overall credit trends have remained stable and the majority of our borrowers continued to demonstrate resilience despite the impact of higher borrowing costs slower economic growth elevated inflation and the overall uncertain economy however management cannot provide assurance that the nonperforming assets will not materially increase from the levels reported at september due to the aforementioned or other factors potentially impacting our lending customers the following table sets forth by loan category accruing past due and nonperforming assets at the dates indicated in conjunction with our

npas total accruing past due and nonaccrual loans as a of loans allowance for loan losses as a of nonaccrual loans loans past due to days increased million to million at september as compared to june the increase within this early stage delinquency category was mainly due to one million commercial real estate loan as well as increases in commercial and industrial and secured consumer loan delinquencies loans past due to days increased million to million at september as compared to june largely due to higher residential mortgage delinquencies and a million commercial real estate loan that migrated from the days past due category at june partially offset by a decline in commercial and industrial and consumer loan delinquencies loans days or more past due and still accruing interest decreased million to million at september as compared to june mainly due to a payoff of a million commercial real estate loan all loans days or more past due and still accruing interest are wellsecured and in the process of collection nonaccrual loans increased million to million at september as compared to million at june mostly driven by an increase in the commercial and industrial loan category nonaccrual commercial and industrial loans increased million to million at september mainly due to one new nonperforming loan relationship totaling million at september although the timing of collection is uncertain management believes that the majority of the nonaccrual loans at september are well secured and largely collectible based in part on our quarterly review of collateral dependent loans and the valuation of the underlying collateral if applicable any estimated shortfall in each collateral valuation results in an allocation of specific reserves within our allowance for credit losses for loans nonperforming taxi medallion loans totaled million of the million nonaccrual commercial and industrial loans at september at september all taxi medallion loans in the loan portfolio were on nonaccrual status and had related reserves of million or percent of such loans within the allowance for loan losses potential further declines in the market valuation of taxi medallions and the c urrent operating environment mainly within new york city may negatively impact the performance of this portfolio oreo properties totaled thousand at september and decreased thousand as compared to june primarily due to sales of oreo p roperties the sales of oreo properties resulted in gains of thousand and thousand for the three and nine months ended september respectively as compared to net losses of thousand and thousand for the three and nine months ended september respectively the residential mortgage and consumer loans secured by residential real estate properties for which formal foreclosure proceedings are in process totale d thousand and million at september and december respectively allowance for credit losses for loans the allowance for credit losses acl for loans includes the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments under cecl our methodology to establish the allowance for loan losses has two basic components i a collective reserve component for estimated expected credit losses for pools of loans that share common risk characteristics and ii an individual reserve component for loans that do not share risk characteristics consisting of collateral dependent loans valley also maintains a separate allowance for unfunded credit commitments mainly consisting of undisbursed noncancellable lines of credit new loan commitments and commercial standby letters of credit valley estimated the collective acl using a current expected credit losses methodology which is based on relevant information about historical experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the loan balances in estimating the component of the allowance on a collective basis we use a transition matrix model which calculates an expected life of loan loss percentage for each loan pool by generating probability of default and loss given default metrics the metrics are based on the migration of loans within the commercial and industrial loan categories from performing to loss by credit quality rating or delinquency categories using historical lifeofloan analysis periods for each loan portfolio pool and the severity of loss based on the aggregate net lifetime losses the models expected losses based on loss history are adjusted for qualitative factors among other things these adjustments include and account for differences in i the impact of the reasonable and supportable economic forecast relative probability weightings and reversion period ii other asset specific risks to the extent that they do not exist in the historical loss information and iii net expected recoveries of chargedoff loan balances these adjustments are based on qualitative factors not reflected in the quantitative model but are likely to impact the measurement of estimated credit losses the expected lifetime loss rate is the life of loan loss percentage from the transition matrix model plus the impact of the adjustments for qualitative factors the expected credit losses are the product of multiplying the models expected lifetime loss rate by the exposure at default at period end on an undiscounted basis valley utilizes a twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period followed by a oneyear period over which estimated losses revert to historical loss experience for the remaining life of the loan on a straightline basis the forecasts consist of a multiscenario economic forecast model to estimate future credit losses and are governed by a crossfunctional committee the committee meets each quarter to determine which economic scenarios developed by moodys will be incorporated into the model as well as the relative probability weightings of the selected scenarios based upon all readily available information the model projects economic variables under each scenario based on detailed statistical analyses we have identified and selected key variables that most closely correlated to our historical credit performance which include gdp unemployment and the caseshiller home price index at september valley continued to maintain the majority of its probability weighting used in the economic forecast to the moodys baseline scenario with slightly less emphasis on the s3 downside and s4 adverse scenarios as compared to june the standalone moodys baseline forecast at september contained among other things slower but positive gdp growth rates a cooling labor market and a continued deceleration of inflation and overall it provided a moderately more pessimistic outlook as compared to june at september the moodys baseline forecast included the following specific assumptions gdp expansion of approximately percent in the fourth quarter unemployment of percent in the fourth quarter and to percent over the remainder of the forecast period ending in the third quarter continued concerns about increased debt burden pushed by rising interest rates elevated inflation and house prices consumer spending remained a source of growth and its contribution grew to the largest in nearly two years as the costofliving adjusted boosted aftertax income adding another percent to growth the federal reserve opted to pause its rate hikes keeping the federal funds rate at percent with possible increases by the end of and inflation moderately cooled but remained at percent in the third quarter see more details regarding our allowance for credit losses for loans in note to the consolidated financial statements the table below
