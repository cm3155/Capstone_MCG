thereto appearing in part item of this report the words valley the company we our and us refer to valley national bancorp and its wholly owned subsidiaries unless we indicate otherwise additionally valleys principal subsidiary valley national bank is commonly referred to as the bank in this mda the mda contains supplemental financial information described in the sections that follow which has been determined by methods other than us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap that management uses in its analysis of our performance management believes these nongaap financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding our underlying operational performance our business and performance trends and facilitate comparisons with the performance of others in the financial services industry these nongaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with us gaap these nongaap financial measures may also be calculated differently from similar measures disclosed by other companies cautionary statement concerning forwardlooking statements this quarterly report on s including the risk factors section of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december critical accounting policies and estimates valleys accounting policies are fundamental to understanding managements discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations at march we identified our policies on the allowance for credit losses goodwill and other intangible assets and income taxes to be critical accounting policies because management has to make subjective andor complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions management has reviewed the application of these policies with the audit committee of valleys board of directors our critical accounting policies are described in detail in part ii item in valleys annual report on form 10k for the year ended december new authoritative accounting guidance see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new authoritative accounting guidance including the respective dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition executive summary company overview at march valley had consolidated total assets of approximately billion total net loans of billion total deposits of billion and total shareholders equity of billion our commercial bank operations include branch office locations in northern and central new jersey the new york city boroughs of manhattan brooklyn queens and long island florida and alabama of our current branch network percent percent percent and percent of the branches are in new jersey new york flor ida and alabama respectively despite targeted branch consolidation activity we have significantly grown both in asset size and locations over the past several years primarily through bank acquisitions impact of covid19 during the first quarter the covid19 pandemic continued to cause uncertainty volatility and disruption in financial markets and in governmental commercial and consumer activity in the united states and globally including the markets that we serve however the overall level of economic activity and our outlook improved during the first quarter largely due to government stimulus programs central bank policies strong vaccine rollout efforts and consumers and businesses eager to return to a state of normalcy after almost a year of lockdowns the american rescue plan act of signed into law on march is a trillion economic stimulus package intended to continue to facilitate the recovery from the economic and health effects of the covid19 pandemic this new law combined with the consolidated appropriations act signed into law on december provides amongst other stimulus additional funding under the sbas paycheck protection program ppp valleys ppp loan portfolio increased million to billion at march from december which was net of over million of ppp loans forgiven by the sba during the first quarter during the second quarter valley originated approximately million of additional ppp loans through may which was the last day the sbas ppp loan application window was open for most lenders in response to the covid19 pandemic and its economic impact on certain customers and in accordance with provisions set forth by the coronavirus aid relief and economic security cares act valley implemented shortterm loan modifications such as payment deferrals fee waivers extensions of repayment terms or delays in payment that are insignificant when requested by customers generally the modification terms allow for a deferral of payments for up to days which valley may extend for an additional days any extensions beyond this period were made in accordance with applicable regulatory guidance as of march vall ey had million of outstanding loans remaining in their payment deferral period under shortterm modifications representing approximately percent of our total loan portfolio at march as compared to million or percent of total loans at december we continue to monitor the impact of covid19 closely as well as any effects that may result from the cares act enhancement act and other government stimulus or federal reserve actions however the extent to which the covid19 pandemic will impact our operations and financial results during the second quarter and beyond is highly uncertain see the operating environment section of mda for more details we continue to closely monitor local conditions in the areas we serve and will take actions as circumstances warrant which may necessitate certain branch or other office closures and reduced lobby services our business continuity plan continues to remain in effect with many of our noncustomer facing employees continuing to work remotely quarterly results net income for the first quarter was million or per diluted common share compared to million or per diluted common share for the first quarter the million increase in quarterly net income as compared to the same quarter one year ago was largely due to a million increase in net interest income mainly due to i lower rates on our deposit products combined with a continued customer shift to deposits without stated maturities ii continued runoff of higher cost time deposits iii interest and fee income from ppp loans and iv the prepayment of million of longterm fhlb advances with a combined weighted average interest rate of percent in december and a million decrease in our provision for credit losses mainly due to the improved economic forecast component of the reserve as compared to march partially offset by a million decrease in noninterest income mainly caused by lower commercial loan customer swap fees and a decrease in gains on the sales of residential mortgage loans a million increase in noninterest expense due to higher salary and employee benefits expense and increases in data processing costs and telecommunication expense and a million increase in income tax expense see the net interest income noninterest income noninterest expense and income taxes sections below for more details on the items above impacting our first quarter results operating environment during the first quarter real gross domestic product expanded percent compared to percent growth in the fourth quarter the acceleration in growth was broadbased as a result of increased investments and households consumption for a range of goods and services economic activity is likely to remain strong as covid19 cases are expected to decline and vaccination rates in the country increase in addition the recent passage of the american rescue plan act of should further support this outlook the federal reserve continued to assist economic activity and the return to sustained expansion at their meeting in march the federal open market committee maintained the target range for the federal funds rate between and percent the 10year us treasury note yield ended the first quarter at percent basis points higher compared with december the spread between the and 10year us treasury note yields ended the first quarter at percent a basis point widening as compared to the end of the fourth quarter for all commercial banks in the us loans and leases declined approximately percent on an annual basis in the first quarter compared to the previous linked quarter for the industry banks reported that demand for commercial and industrial lending remains weak for commercial real estate loans conditions were mixed while demand picked up considerably for loans secured by multifamily residential structures the environment remains challenged for loans secured by nonfarm nonresidential structures in the first quarter valleys originations increased across most products particularly from residential mortgage and consumer lending valley also benefited from a stronger origination pipeline for nonppp commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans across its geographies particularly in florida partly driven by expansion of its lending teams however should loan demand weaken or the expected recovery from the pandemic in valleys primary markets be prolonged our business operations and results could be adversely impacted as highlighted elsewhere in this mda loans loans increased million to approximately billion at march from december the increase was largely due to new loan volumes within the commercial and industrial commercial real estate and automobile loan portfolios in the first quarter within commercial and industrial loans ppp loans increased million to approximately billion at march from december our first quarter new and refinanced loan originations included approximately million of residential mortgage loans originated for sale rather than investment net gains on sales of residential loans were million and million in the first quarter and fourth quarter respectively see further details on our loan activities under the loan portfolio section below asset quality total nonperforming assets npas consisting of nonaccrual loans other real estate owned oreo other repossessed assets and a nonaccrual debt security increased million to million at march as compared to december nonaccrual loans increased million to million at march as compared to december mainly due to one commercial real estate loan and an increase in nonaccrual residential mortgage loans partially caused by the migration of loans previously reported in the days past due category at december nonaccrual loans represented percent of total loans at march as compared to percent at december total accruing past due loans ie loans past due days or more and still accruing interest decreased million to million or percent of total loans at march as compared to million or percent of total loans at december mainly due to declines in early stage delinquencies for most loan categories see further details in the nonperforming assets section below deposits and other borrowings av erage noninterest bearing deposits savings now and money market deposits and time deposits represented approximately percent percent and percent of total deposits as of march respectively overall average deposits increased by million to billion for the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter our mix of the deposit categories within total average deposits for the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter experienced a continued shift of maturing time deposits and consumer preference to nonmaturity deposit account due to the low level of interest rates actual ending balances for deposits increased million to approximately billion at march from december largely due to increases of million and billion in the noninterest bearing and nonmaturity interest bearing deposit categories respectively partially offset by a billion decrease in time deposits the decrease in time deposits was driven by normal runoff of maturing retail and brokered cds with some continued migration of retail balances to more liquid deposit product categories total brokered deposits consisting of both time and money market deposit accounts decreased approximately million to billion at march as compared to billion at december noninterest bearing deposits savings now and money market deposits and time deposits represented approximately percent percent and percent of total deposits as of march respectively while we believe the current operating environment will likely continue to be favorable for valleys deposit gathering initiatives we cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain deposit levels at or near those reported at march average shortterm borrowings decreased million to billion for the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter due to reductions in our excess liquidity levels average longterm borrowings including junior subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts which are presented separately on the consolidated statements of financial condition decreased by million to billion for the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter mainly due to the prepayment of million of longterm fhlb borrowings in december actual ending balances for shortterm borrowings decreased by million to billion at march from the fourth quarter due to the decline in overnight borrowings longterm borrowings decreased by million to billion at march as compared to december mainly attributable to the normal maturities of fhlb advances selected performance indicators the

expenses are primarily within professional and legal fees and other noninterest expense in addition to the items used to calculate net income as adjusted in the table above our net income is from time to time impacted by fluctuations in the level of net gains on sales of loans and swap fees recognized from commercial loan customer transactions these amounts can vary widely from period to period due to among other factors the amount of residential mortgage loans originated for sale loan portfolio sales and commercial loan customer demand for certain products see the noninterest income section

main source of income for valley net interest income on a tax equivalent basis totaling million for the first quarter increased million and million as compared to the fourth quarter and first quarter respectively the increase as compared to the fourth quarter was mainly due to i increased interest and fee income from ppp loans ii continued runoff of higher cost time deposits iii the prepayment of million of longterm fhlb advances with a combined weighted average interest rate of percent in december and iv lower rates on our deposit products combined with a continued customer shift to deposits without stated maturities interest expense of million for the first quarter decreased million as compared to the fourth quarter interest income on a tax equivalent basis in the first quarter decreased by million to million as compared to the fourth quarter mainly due to lower overall yields on average taxable investment securities and loans and a decline in average balances within the investment portfolio due to normal repayment activity partially offset by a million increase in interest and fees on ppp loans caused by recognition of fee income on loans forgiven by the sba during the first quarter average interest earning assets increased billion to billion for the first quarter as compared to the first quarter primarily due to organic loan growth over the 12month period including billion of ppp loans as compared to the fourth quarter average interest earning assets decreased by million from billion partly driven by lower level of excess liquidity held in overnight interest bearing deposits with banks the decrease in average overnight interest bearing deposits with banks was largely caused by funds used in the prepayment of longterm fhlb borrowings totaling million in december average interest bearing liabilities decreased million to billion for the first quarter as compared to the first quarter primarily due to the repayments of longterm fhlb advances and a decline in overnight borrowings partially offset by higher average deposit levels caused by general increases in customer balances as compared to the fourth quarter average interest bearing li abilities decreased by million in the first quarter mainly due to decreases in long and shortterm borrowings largely attributable to the december prepayment and normal maturities of fhlb advances respectively as we reduced our reliance on wholesale funding sources see additional information under deposits and other borrowings in the executive summary section above our net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis of percent for the first quarter increased by basis points and basis points from percent and percent for the first quarter and fourth quarter respectively the yield on average interest earning assets increased by basis points on a linked quarter basis mostly due to the higher yield on the ppp loan portfolio and reduced excess liquidity held in overnight investments the yield on average loans decreased by basis point to percent for the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter this decrease was mainly due to new and refinanced loan originations at lower market interest rates and two less days during the first quarter which were mostly offset by the increased yield on our ppp loan portfolio the overall cost of average interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points to percent for the first quarter as compared to the linked fourth quarter largely due to the lower rates offered on deposit products maturing time deposits and a basis point decrease in the average cost of shortterm borrowings our cost of total average deposits was percent for the first quarter as compared to percent for the fourth quarter looking forward we expect moderate ongoing interest rate pressures on our net interest margin for the second quarter and beyond due to the low level of market rates and the potential negative impact on the overall yield on new and refinanced loan originations however we are also encouraged by the continued potential opportunity to repay or reprice stated maturity deposits and borrowings maturing at low costs during the remainder of on april we elected to call and prepay million of subordinated notes that were bearing interest of percent per annum and had an original contractual maturity date of april the following table reflects

residential mortgage loans sold from our loan portfolio during the first quarter see further discussion of our residential mortgage loan origination activity under the loan portfolio section of this mda below bank owned life insurance income decreased thousand for the first quarter as compared to the first quarter partly due to lower yields on the underlying fixed income investments held by

income plus total noninterest income we believe this nongaap measure provides a meaningful comparison of our operational performance and facilitates investors assessments of business performance and trends in comparison to our peers in the banking industry our overall efficiency ratio and its comparability to some of our peers is negatively impacted primarily by the amortization of tax credit investments as well as infrequent charges within noninterest income and expense including but not limited to merger expenses the following table presents our efficiency ratio and a reconciliation of

first quarter respectively our effective tax rate was percent percent and percent for the first quarter fourth quarter and first quarter respectively the decrease in the effective tax rate as compared to the fourth quarter was mainly due to an increase in the excess stock compensation benefit for the first quarter us gaap requires that any change in judgment or change in measurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period be recognized as a discrete event in the quarter in which it occurs rather than being recognized as a change in effective tax rate for the current year our adherence to these tax guidelines may result in volatile effective income tax rates in future quarterly and annual periods factors that could impact managements judgment include changes in income tax laws and regulations and tax planning strategies business segments we have four business segments that we monitor and report on to manage our business operations these segments are consumer lending commercial lending investment management and corporate and other adjustments our reportable segments have been determined based upon valleys internal structure of operations and lines of business each business segment is reviewed routinely for its asset growth contribution to income before income taxes and return on average interest earning assets and impairment if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount expenses related to the branch network all other components of retail banking along with the back office departments of the bank are allocated from the corporate and other adjustments segment to each of the other three business segments interest expense and internal transfer expense for general corporate expenses are allocated to each business segment utilizing a transfer pricing methodology which involves the allocation of operating and funding costs based on each segments respective mix of average earning assets andor liabilities outstanding for the period the financial reporting for each segment contains allocations and reporting in line with our operations which may not necessarily be comparable to any other financial institution the accounting for each segment includes internal accounting policies designed to measure consistent and reasonable financial reporting and may result in income and expense measurements that differ from amounts under us gaap furthermore changes in management structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result in changes in reported segment financial data the following tables present the financial data for each business segment for the three months ended march and three months ended march consumer lending commercial lending investment management corporate and other adjustments total in thousands average interest earning assets income loss before income taxes annualized return on average interest earning assets before tax na three months ended march consumer lending commercial lending investment management corporate and other adjustments total in thousands average interest earning assets income loss before income taxes annualized return on average interest earning assets before tax na see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information consumer lending this consumer lending segment represented percent of our loan portfolio at march and was mainly comprised of residential mortgage loans and automobile loans and to a lesser extent home equity loans secured personal lines of credit and other consumer loans including credit card loans the duration of the residential mortgage loan portfolio which represented percent of our loan portfolio at march is subject to movements in the market level of interest rates and forecasted prepayment speeds the weighted average life of the automobile loans representing percent of total loans at march is relatively unaffected by movements in the market level of interest rates however the average life may be impacted by new loans as a result of the availability of credit within the automobile marketplace and consumer demand for purchasing new or used automobiles the consumer lending segment also includes the wealth management and insurance services division comprised of trust asset management and insurance services average interest earning assets in this segment decreased million to billion for the three months ended march as compared to the first quarter the decrease was largely due to continued residential mortgage loan refinance activity and a higher percentage of mortgage loans originated for sale rather than held for investment over the last month period automobile loan demand was also tempered during the onset of the pandemic before steadily strengthening in the fourth quarter and first quarter income before income taxes generated by the consumer lending segment increased million to million for the first quarter as compared to the first quarter largely due to a million decrease in the provision for loan losses coupled with a million increase in net interest income the decrease in the provision for loan losses was mainly due to the improvement in the economic forecast component of the allowance for loan losses at march as compared to march see further details in the allowance for credit losses section of this mda the increase in net interest income was largely driven by lower funding costs partially offset by lower yields on consumer loans and the decline in average loan balances the net interest margin on the consumer lending portfolio increased basis points to percent for the first quarter as compared to the first quarter mainly due to a basis point decrease in the costs associated with our funding sources partially offset by a basis point decrease in the yield on average loans the decrease in our funding costs was largely due to the lower rates offered on deposit products maturing time deposits and an basis point decrease in the average cost of shortterm borrowings the basis point decrease in loan yield was due to lower yielding new and refinanced loan volumes see the executive summary and the net interest income sections above for more details on our net interest margin and funding sources commercial lending the commercial lending segment is comprised of floating rate and adjustable rate commercial and industrial loans and construction loans as well as fixed rate owner occupied and commercial real estate loans due to the portfolios interest rate characteristics commercial lending is valleys business segment that is most sensitive to movements in market interest rates commercial and industrial loans totaled approximately billion and represented percent of the total loan portfolio at march commercial real estate loans and construction loans totaled billion and represented percent of the total loan portfolio at march average interest earning assets in this segment increased approximately billion to billion for the three months ended march as compared to the first quarter the increase was mostly due to the origination of ppp loans totaling billion within the commercial and industrial portfolio at march as well as organic commercial real estate loan growth over most of the last month period for the three months ended march income before income taxes for the commercial lending segment increased million to million as compared to the first quarter mainly driven by an increase in net interest income combined with a decline in the provision for credit losses net interest income for this segment increased million to million for the first quarter as compared to the same period in primarily due to lower funding costs and interest and fee income largely resulting from ppp loans the provision for credit losses decreased by million mainly due to the improvement in the economic forecast component of the allowance for loan losses as compared to march the positive impact of the aforementioned items was partially offset by a decrease in noninterest income and higher internal transfer expense noninterest income decreased million to million for the three months ended march as compared to the first quarter mainly due to an million decrease in swap fee income related to derivative interest rate swaps executed with commercial loan customers internal transfer expense increased million for the first quarter as compared to the first quarter partly due to general increases related to organic growth in our business the net interest margin for this segment increased basis points to percent for the first quarter as compared to the first quarter due to a basis point decrease in the cost of our funding sources which was mostly offset by a basis point decrease in the yield on average loans i nvestment management the investment management segment generates a large portion of our income through investments in various types of securities and interestbearing deposits with other banks these investments are mainly comprised of fixed rate securities and depending on our liquid cash position federal funds sold and interestbearing deposits with banks primarily the federal reserve bank of new york as part of our assetliability management strategies the fixed rate investments are one of valleys least sensitive assets to changes in market interest rates however a portion of the investment portfolio is invested in shorterduration securities to maintain the overall asset sensitivity of our balance sheet see the assetliability management section below for further analysis average interest earning assets in this segment increased million during the first quarter as compared to the first quarter primarily due to a million increase in average interest bearing deposits with banks partially offset by a million decrease in average investment securities the increase in average overnight interest bearing deposits with banks was due in part to a lower rate of reinvestment of normal repayments within our investment securities portfolio for the first quarter income before income taxes for the investment management segment decreased million to million as compared to the first quarter mostly due to a million decrease in net interest income partially offset by a lower provision for credit losses the decrease in net interest income was primarily due to normal repayments of higher yielding securities and the low yields on the increased overnight investment balances the provision for credit losses decreased million for the three months ended march as compared to the first quarter the net interest margin for this segment decreased basis points to percent for the first quarter as compared to the same quarter in largely due to a basis point decrease in the yield on average investments partially offset by a basis point decrease in our cost of funding the decrease in the yield on average investments as compared to the first quarter was largely driven by principal repayments on higher yielding residential mortgagebacked securities acceleration of premium amortization expense related to the increased prepayment of mortgagebacked securities and purchases of lower yielding investment securities over the last months corporate and other adjustments the amounts disclosed as corporate and other adjustments represent income and expense items not directly attributable to a specific segment including net securities gains and losses not reported in the investment management segment above interest expense related to subordinated notes amortization and impairment of tax credit investments as well as noncore items including merger expenses the corporate segment recognized pretax losses of million and million for the three months ended march and respectively the decline in the pretax loss for the first quarter was largely due to a million increase in internal transfer income partially offset by a million increase in noninterest expense the increase in noninterest expense was largely driven by increases in salaries and employee benefits expenses higher data processing and telecommunication expenses partially offset by a decrease in amortization of tax credit investments see further details in the noninterest income and noninterest expense sections of this mda assetliability management interest rate sensitivity our success is largely dependent upon our ability to manage interest rate risk interest rate risk can be defined as the exposure of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities to the movement in interest rates our assetliability management committee is responsible for managing such risks and establishing policies that monitor and coordinate our sources and uses of funds assetliability management is a continuous process due to the constant change in interest rate risk factors in assessing the appropriate interest rate risk levels for us management weighs the potential benefit of each risk management activity within the desired parameters of liquidity capital levels and managements tolerance for exposure to income fluctuations many of the actions undertaken by management utilize fair value analysis and attempt to achieve consistent accounting and economic benefits for financial assets and their related funding sources we have predominantly focused on managing our interest rate risk by attempting to match the inherent risk and cash flows of financial assets and liabilities specifically management employs multiple risk management activities such as optimizing the level of new residential mortgage originations retained in our mortgage portfolio through increasing or decreasing loan sales in the secondary market product pricing levels the desired maturity levels for new originations the composition levels of both our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as well as several other risk management activities we use a simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity to movements in interest rates the simulation model projects net interest income based on various interest rate scenarios over a 12month and 24month period the model is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of rate sensitive assets and liabilities the model incorporates certain assumptions which management believes to be reasonable regarding the impact of changing interest rates and the prepayment assumptions of certain assets and liabilities as of march the model assumes immediate changes in interest rates without any proactive change in the composition or size of the balance sheet or other future actions that management might undertake to mitigate this risk in the model the forecasted shape of the yield curve remains static as of march the impact of interest rate derivatives such as interest rate swaps is also included in the model our simulation model is based on market interest rates and prepayment speeds prevalent in the market as of march although the size of valleys balance sheet is forecasted to remain static as of march in our model the composition is adjusted to reflect new interest earning assets and funding originations coupled with rate spreads utilizing our actual originations during the first quarter the model also utilizes an immediate parallel shift in market interest rates at march the assumptions used in the net interest income simulation are inherently uncertain actual results may differ significantly from those presented in the table below due to the frequency and timing of changes in interest rates and changes in spreads between maturity and repricing categories overall our net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates and cash flows from our loan and investment portfolios we actively manage these cash flows in conjunction with our liability mix duration and interest rates to optimize the net interest income while structuring the balance sheet in response to actual or potential changes in interest rates additionally our net interest income is impacted by the level of competition within our marketplace competition can negatively impact the level of interest rates attainable on loans and increase the cost of deposits which may result in downward pressure on our net interest margin in future periods other factors including but not limited to the slope of the yield curve and projected cash flows will impact our net interest income results and may increase or decrease the level of asset sensitivity of our balance sheet convexity is a measure of how the duration of a financial instrument changes as market interest rates change potential movements in the convexity of bonds held in our investment portfolio as well as the duration of the loan portfolio may have a positive or negative impact on our net interest income in varying interest rate environments as a result the increase or decrease in forecasted net interest income may not have a linear relationship to the results reflected in the table below management cannot provide any assurance about the actual effect of changes in interest rates on our net interest income the following table reflects managements expectations of the change in our net interest income over the next month period considering the aforementioned assumptions while an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this simulation model we believe that any actual shift in interest rates would likely be more gradual and would therefore have a more modest impact than shown in the table below estimated change in future net interest income changes in interest rates dollar change percentage change in basis points in thousands as noted in the table above a basis point immediate increase in interest rates combined with a static balance sheet where the size mix and proportions of assets and liabilities remain unchanged is projected to increase net interest income over the next month period by percent management believes the interest rate sensitivity remains within an acceptable tolerance range at march however the level of net interest income sensitivity may increase or decrease in the future as a result of several factors including potential changes in our balance sheet strategies the slope of the yield curve and projected cash flows liquidity and cash requirements bank liquidity liquidity measures the ability to satisfy current and future cash flow needs as they become due a banks liquidity reflects its ability to meet loan demand to accommodate possible outflows in deposits and to take advantage of interest rate opportunities in the marketplace liquidity management is carefully performed and routinely reported by our treasury department to two board committees among other actions treasury reviews historical funding requirements current liquidity position sources and stability of funding marketability of assets options for attracting additional funds and anticipated future funding needs including the level of unfunded commitments our goal is to maintain sufficient liquidity to cover current and potential funding requirements the bank has no required regulatory liquidity ratios to maintain however it adheres to an internal liquidity policy the current policy maintains that we may not have a ratio of loans to deposits in excess of percent or reliance on wholesale funding greater than percent of total funding the bank was in compliance with the foregoing policies at march valleys short and longterm cash requirements include contractual obligations under borrowings deposits payment related to leases capital expenditures and other purchase commitments in the ordinary course of operations the bank also enters into various financial obligations including contractual obligations that may require future cash payments management believes the bank has the ability to generate and obtain adequate amounts of cash to meet its shortterm and longterm obligations as they come due by utilizing various cash resources described below on the asset side of the balance sheet the bank has numerous sources of liquid funds in the form of cash and due from banks interest bearing deposits with banks including the federal reserve bank of new york investment securities held to maturity that are maturing within days or would otherwise qualify as maturities if sold ie percent of original cost basis has been repaid investment securities available for sale loans held for sale and from time to time federal funds sold and receivables related to unsettled securities transactions total liquid assets were approximate ly billion representing percent of earning assets at march and billion representing percent of earning assets at december of the billion of liquid assets at march approximately million of various investment securities were pledged to counterparties to support our earning asset funding strategies we anticipate the receipt of approx imately million in principal payments from securities in the total investment portfolio over the next month period due to normally scheduled principal repayments and expected prepayments of certain securities primarily residential mortgagebacked securities additional liquidity is derived from scheduled loan payments of principal and interest as well as prepayments received loan principal payments including loans held for sale at march are projected in accordance with their scheduled contractual terms to be approximately billion over the next month period as a contingency plan for any liquidity constraints liquidity could also be derived from the sale of conforming residential mortgages from our loan portfolio or alleviated from the temporary curtail ment of lending activities on the liability side of the balance sheet we utilize multiple sources of funds to meet liquidity needs including retail and commercial deposits brokered and municipal deposits and shortterm and longterm borrowings our core deposit base which generally excludes fully insured brokered deposits and both retail and brokered certificates of deposit over thousand represents the largest of these sources average core deposits totaled approximately billion and billion for the three months ended march and for the year ended december respectively representing percent and percent of average earning assets for the respective periods the level of interest bearing deposits is affected by interest rates offered which is often influenced by our need for funds and the need to match the maturities of assets and liabilities additional funding may be provided through deposit gathering networks and in the form of federal funds purchased through our well established relationships with numerous banks while these lending lines are uncommitted management believes that the bank could borrow approximately billion from these banks on a collective basis the bank is also a member of the federal home loan bank of new york fhlb and has the ability to borrow from them in the form of fhlb advances secured by pledges of certain eligible collateral including but not limited to us government and agency mortgagebacked securities and a blanket assignment of qualifying first lien mortgage loans consisting of both residential mortgage and commercial real estate loans additionally valleys collateral pledged to the fhlb may be used to obtain municipal letters of credit muloc to collateralize certain municipal deposits held by valley at march valley had million of mulocs outstanding for this purpose furthermore we can obtain overnight borrowings from the federal reserve bank of new york via the discount window as a contingency for additional liquidity at march our borrowing capacity excluding added capacity available to us by pledging ppp loans under the federal reserve banks discount window was billion we also have access to other shortterm and longterm borrowing sources to support our asset base such as repos ie securities sold under agreements to repurchase shortterm borrowings consisting of fhlb advances repos and from time to time federal funds purchased decreased approximately million to billion at march as compared to december primarily driven by normal maturities corporation liquidity valleys recurring cash requirements primarily consist of dividends to preferred and common shareholders and interest expense on subordinated notes and junior subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts as part of our ongoing assetliability management strategies valley could also use cash to repurchase shares of its outstanding common stock under its share repurchase program or redeem its callable junior subordinated debentures these cash needs are routinely satisfied by dividends collected from the bank projected cash flows from the bank are expected to be adequate to pay preferred and common dividends if declared and interest expense payable to subordinated note holders and capital trusts given the current capital levels and current profitable operations of the bank in addition to dividends received from the bank valley can satisfy its cash requirements by utilizing its own cash and potential new funds borrowed from outside sources or capital issuances valley also has the right to defer interest payments on the junior subordinated debentures and therefore distributions on its trust preferred securities for consecutive quarterly periods up to five years but not beyond the stated maturity dates and subject to other conditions investment securities portfolio as of march we had million billion and billion in equities available for sale debt securities and held to maturity debt securities respectively our equity securities portfolio is mainly comprised of a money market mutual fund and investments in public and private community reinvestment act funds our held to maturity and available for sale debt securities portfolios were comprised of us treasury securities us government agency securities taxexempt and taxable issuances of states and political subdivisions residential mortgagebacked securities singleissuer trust preferred securities principally issued by bank holding companies and high quality corporate bonds among other securities our available for sale debt securities include securities such as bank issued and other corporate bonds as well as municipal special revenue bonds that may pose a higher risk of future impairment charges to us as a result of the uncertain economic environment and its potential negative effect on the future performance of the security issuers there were no securities in the name of any one issuer exceeding percent of shareholders equity except for residential mortgagebacked securities issued by ginnie mae and fannie mae certain securities with limited marketability andor restrictions such as federal home loan bank and federal reserve bank stocks are carried at cost and are included in other assets allowance for credit losses and impairment analysis available for sale debt securities available for sale debt securities in unrealized loss positions are evaluated for impairment related to credit losses at least quarterly in assessing whether a credit loss exists we compare the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security with the amortized cost basis of the security if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis for the security a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded limited to the amount the fair value is less than amortized cost basis declines in fair value that have not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses such as declines due to changes in market interest rates are recorded through other comprehensive income net of applicable taxes we have evaluated all available for sale debt securities that are in an unrealized loss position as of march and determined that the declines in fair value are mainly attributable to changes in market volatility due to factors such as interest rates and spread factors but not attributable to credit quality or other factors based on a comparison of the present value of expected cash flows to the amortized cost management recognized no impairment charges during the three months ended march and as a result there was no allowance for credit losses for available for sale debt securities at march held to maturity debt securities valley estimates the expected credit losses on held to maturity debt securities that have loss expectations using a discounted cash flow model developed by a third party valley has a zero loss expectation for certain securities within the held to maturity portfolio including us treasury securities us agency securities residential mortgagebacked securities issued by ginnie mae fannie mae and freddie mac and collateralized municipal bonds which are excluded from the model assumptions used in the model for pools of securities with common risk characteristics include the historical lifetime probability of default and severity of loss in the event of default with the model incorporating several economic cycles of loss history data to calculate expected credit losses given default at the individual security level held to maturity debt securities were carried net of allowance for credit losses totaling million and million at march and december respectively valley recorded a credit negative provision for credit losses of thousand during the first quarter and a provision for credit losses of thousand for the first quarter respectively there were no net chargeoffs of debt securities in the respective periods investment grades the investment grades in the table below reflect the most current independent analysis performed by third parties of each security as of the date presented and not necessarily the investment grades at the date of our purchase of the securities for many securities the rating agencies may not have performed an independent analysis of the tranches owned by us but rather an analysis of the entire investment pool for this and other reasons we believe the assigned investment grades may not accurately reflect the actual credit quality of each security and should not be viewed in isolation as a measure of the quality of our investment portfolio the following table presents the held to maturity and available for sale debt securities portfolios by investment grades at march march amortized cost gross unrealized gains gross unrealized losses fair value in thousands available for sale investment grades aaa

net unearned discount and deferred loan fees of million million million million and million at march december september june and march respectively net unearned discounts and deferred loan fees included million million million and million of net unearned fees related to ppp loans at march december september and june respectively commercial and industrial loans increased million or percent on an annualized basis to billion at march as compared to december mostly due to the million increase in ppp loans which was net of over million of ppp loans forgiven by the sba during the first quarter valley expects the majority of these borrowers to qualify for loan forgiveness under the guidelines of the sba program which impact our ability to grow the commercial and industrial loan portfolio nonppp commercial and industrial loans increased million or percent at march as compared to december mostly due to expansion of our lending teams during the first quarter as well as stronger demand in certain customer segments including healthcare lending commercial real estate loans excluding construction loans increased million or percent on an annualized basis to billion at march from december reflecting the recovery of our loan commitment pipeline near the end of construction loans increased million to billion at march from december construction demand in our florida markets which have mostly reopened during the current covid19 pandemic remains robust as compared to the northeast and we intend to be strategically competitive for the strongest borrowers and projects in that market residential mortgage loans declined million or percent on an annualized basis during the first quarter mainly due to continued refinance activity and a higher percentage of loans originated for sale rather than held for investment new and refinanced residential mortgage loan originations totaled approximately million for the first quarter as compared to million and million for the fourth quarter and first quarter respectively of the total originations in the first quarter approximately million of residential mortgage loans were originated for sale rather than held for investment during the first quarter we sold approximately million including million of residential mortgage loans held for sale at december we may continue to sell a large portion of our new fixed rate residential mortgage loan originations during the second quarter based upon normal management of the interest rate risk and mix of the interest earning assets on our balance sheet home equity loans moderately increased million to million at march from december new home equity loan volumes and customer usage of existing home equity lines of credit continue to be modest despite the favorable low interest rate environment automobile loans increased by million or percent on an annualized basis to billion at march as compared to december due to strong consumer demand seen across the auto industry during the first quarter our florida dealership network contributed million in auto loan originations representing approximately percent of new loans during the first quarter as compared to million or percent of new loans during the fourth quarter other consumer loans decreased thousand to million at march as compared to million at december mainly due to tempered usage and demand within our collateralized personal lines of credit portfolio most of our lending is in northern and central new jersey new york city long island and florida except for smaller auto and residential mortgage loan portfolios derived from other neighboring states of new jersey to mitigate our geographic risks we make efforts to maintain a diversified portfolio as to type of borrower and loan to guard against a potential downward turn in any one economic sector for the remainder of we remain cautiously optimistic about overall loan growth exclusive of ppp loans in the early stages of the second quarter our loan origination pipelines remain robust and organic growth opportunities especially in florida appear to be closer to prepandemic levels during the first quarter approximately percent of our commercial loan growth come out of florida however there can be no assurance that those positive trends will continue or balances will not decline from march given the potential for unforeseen changes in consumer confidence the economy and other market conditions we believe that many of our sba ppp loans will be eligible for forgiveness in in accordance with the rules of this program and is highly likely to result in a large reduction in these loan balances nonperforming assets nonperforming assets npa include nonaccrual loans other real estate owned oreo other repossessed assets which primarily consists of automobiles and taxi medallions and nonaccrual debt securities at march loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when they become past due in excess of days as to payment of principal or interest exceptions to the nonaccrual policy may be permitted if the loan is sufficiently collateralized and in the process of collection oreo is acquired through foreclosure on loans secured by land or real estate oreo and other repossessed assets are reported at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated cost to sell our npas increased million to million at march as compared to december mainly due to a million increase in nonaccrual loans in the first quarter npas as a percentage of total loans and npas totaled percent and percent at march and december respectively as shown in the table below we believe our total npas has remained relatively low as a percentage of the total loan portfolio over the past months despite the uptick in nonaccrual borrowers mainly caused by covid19 pandemic the level of npas is reflective of our consistent approach to the loan underwriting criteria for both valley originated loans and loans purchased from third parties for additional details see the credit quality indicators section in note to the consolidated financial statements our lending strategy is based on underwriting standards designed to maintain high credit quality and we remain optimistic regarding the overall future performance of our loan portfolio however due to the potential for future credit deterioration caused by the uncertain path of the recovery from the covid pandemic and a number of our borrowers that are still performing under forbearance agreements management cannot provide assurance that our nonperforming assets will not increase substantially

million matured loan in the process of restructuring its terms reported in this delinquency category at december and the migration of one million commercial real estate loan to nonaccrual status at march consumer loan delinquencies decreased by million to million at march as compared december partly due to improved customer performance and results of our collection efforts during the first quarter loans past due to days decreased million to million at march as compared to december mainly due to a decline in the residential loans category partially offset by higher commercial real estate loan delinquencies residential loans past due to days decreased by million as compared to december partly due to loans that migrated to nonaccrual status at march commercial real estate loan delinquencies increased million at march as compared to december largely due to one million potential problem loan reported in this delinquency category at march loans past due days or more and still accruing interest decreased million to million at march as compared to million at december largely due to a million decrease in the commercial and industrial loan category as well as lower commercial real estate and residential mortgage loan delinquencies the decrease in commercial and industrial loans past due or more days was primarily due to premium finance loans related to two insurance carriers totaling million reclassified to nonaccrual status during the first quarter all of the loans past due days or more and still accruing reported at march including million of premium finance loans collateralized by insurance policies within commercial and industrial loans are considered to be well secured and in the process of collection nonaccrual loans increased million to million at march as compared to million at december mostly driven by one million commercial real estate loan and a million increase in nonaccrual residential mortgage loans which was partially caused by the migration of loans previously reported in the days past due category at december we continue to closely monitor our nonperforming new york city and chicago taxi medallion loans totaling million and million respectively within the commercial and industrial loan portfolio at march due to continued negative trends in estimated fair valuations of the underlying taxi medallion collateral a weak operating environment for ride services and uncertain borrower performance all of the taxi medallion loans are on nonaccrual status the low level of the market valuation of taxi medallions adversely affected the estimated fair valuation of these loans and the allowance for loan losses related to such loans at march 2021and december at march nonaccrual taxi medallion loans totaling million and had related reserves of million or percent of such loans within the allowance for loan losses as compared to million with related reserves of million or percent of such loans at december potential further declines in the market valuation of taxi medallions and the stressed operating environment within both new york city and chicago due to the covid19 pandemic could also negatively impact the future performance of this portfolio for example a percent further decline in our current estimated market value of the taxi medallions would require additional allocated rese rves of million w ithin the allowance for loan losses based upon taxi medallion loan balances at march see the allowance for credit losses section below for further details on our reserves oreo properties decreased thousand to

higher risk industries were passrated under valleys internal risk rating system allowance for credit losses for loans the allowance for credit losses acl for loans includes the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments under cecl our methodology to establish the allowance for loan losses has two basic components a collective reserve component for estimated expected credit losses for pools of loans that share common risk characteristics and an individual reserve component for loans that do not share risk characteristics consisting of collateral dependent tdr and expected tdr loans valley also maintains a separate allowance for unfunded credit commitments mainly consisting of undisbursed noncancellable lines of credit new loan commitments and commercial letters of credit valley estimated the collective acl using a current expected credit losses methodology which is based on relevant information about historical experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the loan balances in estimating the component of the allowance on a collective basis we use a transition matrix model which calculates an expected life of loan loss percentage for each loan pool by generating probability of default and loss given default metrics the metrics are based on the migration of loans from performing to loss by credit quality rating or delinquency categories using historical lifeofloan analysis periods for each loan portfolio pool and the severity of loss based on the aggregate net lifetime losses the models expected losses based on loss history are adjusted for qualitative factors among other things these adjustments include and account for differences in i the impact of the reasonable and supportable economic forecast relative probability weightings and reversion period ii other asset specific risks to the extent they do not exist in the historical loss information and iii net expected recoveries of charged off loan balances these adjustments are based on qualitative factors not reflected in the quantitative model but are likely to impact the measurement of estimated credit losses the expected lifetime loss rate is the life of loan loss percentage from the transition matrix model plus the impact of the adjustments for qualitative factors the expected credit losses are the product of multiplying the models expected lifetime loss rate by the exposure at default at period end on an undiscounted basis valley utilizes a twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period followed by a oneyear period over which estimated losses revert to historical loss experience for the remaining life of the loan on a straightline basis the forecasts consist of a multiscenario economic forecast model to estimate future credit losses and is governed by a crossfunctional committee the committee meets each quarter to determine which economic scenarios developed by moodys will be incorporated into the model as well as the relative probability weightings of the selected scenarios based upon all readily available information the model projects economic variables under each scenario based on detailed statistical analyses we have identified and selected key variables that most closely correlated to our historical credit performance which include gdp unemployment and the caseshiller home price index for the first quarter we continued to incorporate a probability weighted threescenario economic forecast including moodys baseline s3 and s4 scenarios at march valley assigned a higher weighting to moodys baseline scenario as compared to december with less emphasis on moodys s3 and s4 downside scenarios this change reflects positive economic developments including federal stimulus and increasing vaccination levels that are expected to lead to improved economic conditions during the remainder of this increased optimism could still be tempered by continued covid19 hot spots in various locales relatively weak labor market conditions and other factors the moodys baseline forecast carried the highest weighting in our threescenario forecast and including the following assumptions at march gdp expansion by over percent in the second quarter unemployment of percent in the second quarter and improving to percent by

credit losses as a percentage of total loans increased in the commercial real estate and construction loan categories while decreasing slightly for most other loan categories as compared to december the allocated reserves as a percentage of commercial and industrial loans declined by basis points partially due to the loan chargeoffs in the first quarter within this loan category as well as the
