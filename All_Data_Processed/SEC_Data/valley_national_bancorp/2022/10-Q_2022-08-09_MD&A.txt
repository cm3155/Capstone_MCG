performance or achievements critical accounting policies and estimates valleys accounting policies are fundamental to understanding managements discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations at june we identified our policies on the allowance for credit losses goodwill and other intangible assets and income taxes to be critical accounting policies because management

using different assumptions management has reviewed the application of these policies and estimates with the audit committee of valleys board of directors our critical accounting policies and

details regarding the acquisition of bank leumi usa and other recent acquisition activities impact of covid19 during the second quarter the impact of the covid pandemic and new global outbreaks of the covid variants were mostly overshadowed by inflationary concerns inflation remains elevated reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the covid pandemic higher food and energy prices and broader price pressures in june travel restrictions were further loosened by eliminating covid19 test requirement to enter the us w e continue to monitor the impact of covid19 including the emergence of any new more severe variants closely including its impact on our employees customers communities and results of operations and other government or federal reserve actions see the operating environment section of mda for more details the coronavirus aid relief and economic security cares act and additional legislation that followed including the consolidated appropriations act and the

valley extended a total of billion ppp loans under the program of which billion of these loans have received forgiveness from the sba as of june we had million including million acquired from bank leumi usa of ppp loans still outstanding quarterly results net income for the second quarter was million or per diluted common share as compared to million or per diluted common share for the second quarter the million decrease in quarterly net income as compared to the same quarter one year ago was mainly due to the following changes a million increase in noninterest expense largely due to million of merger expenses incurred during the second quarter and our expanded banking operations resulting from the acquisition of bank leumi usa on april and the westchester bank holding corporation westchester on december and a million increase in our provision for credit losses mainly due to million of provision related to nonpcd loans and unfunded credit commitments acquired from bank leumi usa partially offset by a million increase in net interest income mainly due to higher average loan balances driven by both acquired and organic loan volumes and increased yields on new and adjustable rate loans a million increase in noninterest income primarily driven by increases in wealth management and trust fees service charges on deposit accounts and other income totaling million million and million respectively generated from the aforementioned bank acquisitions partially offset by lower new gains on sales of loans and a million decrease in income tax expense mostly caused by lower pretax income see the net interest income noninterest income noninterest expense and income taxes sections below for more details on the items above impacting our second quarter results operating environment during the second quarter real gross domestic product gdp at an annual rate decreased percent compared to a decline of percent in the first quarter the second consecutive quarter of decline in economic activity was driven in large part by a decline in inventory restocking and household fixed investment otherwise household demand for goods and services improved modestly despite a continued acceleration in overall prices in may june and july the federal reserve raised the federal funds rate by basis points basis points and basis points respectively resulting in a current target range of percent to percent in addition the federal reserve continued to reduce its holdings of treasury securities and agency debt and mortgagebacked securities the federal reserve indicated it will reduce its treasury and agency securities portfolio by billion per month and after three months will increase to billion per month the changes in policy reflect the federal reserves strong commitment to returning inflation to its percent objective the 10year us treasury note yield ended the second quarter at percent basis points higher compared with march the spread between the and 10year us treasury note yields ended the quarter at percent basis points higher compared to march for all commercial banks in the us loans and leases increased approximately percent from march to june the banking industry reported softening in demand for most commercial loan products particularly for commercial real estate loans secured by nonfarm nonresidential structures in recent months as compared to the beginning of the year during the second quarter valleys new loan originations experienced solid increases across most product types primarily driven by an increase in nonowner occupied commercial real estate commercial and industrial residential mortgage and automobile loans however further declines in gdp continued increases in market interest rates persistently high inflation the lingering impact of the pandemic on supply chains and business opportunities labor market conditions and fallout from the russiaukraine war among other factors add a high level of uncertainty to the future path of the us economy and the risk of a recession should economic conditions continue to deteriorate causing business activity spending and investment to decline it would adversely impact the banks financial results as highlighted below in this mda loans total loans increased billion to billion at june from march largely due to a combination of billion of acquired loans from bank leumi usa and strong organic loan growth excluding acquired loans from bank leumi usa our loan portfolio increased percent on an annualized basis during the second quarter as a result of strong commercial loan volumes and a continued uptick in new residential mortgage loans originated for investment rather than sale we sold approximately million of residential mortgage loans resulting in total pretax gains

million from the second quarter interest income on a tax equivalent basis in the second quarter increased million to million as compared to the first quarter the increase was mostly due to higher average loan balances driven both by acquired and organic loans and increased yields on both new originations and adjustable rate loans in our portfolio interest expense of million for the second quarter increased million as compared to the first quarter largely due to a moderate increase in interest rates on both nonmaturity deposits and shortterm borrowings as well as interest expense related to deposits and borrowings assumed in the bank leumi usa acquisition average interest earning assets increased billion to billion for the second quarter as compared to the second quarter primarily due to the acquisitions of bank leumi usa and westchester on april and december respectively as well as strong organic loan growth over the 12month period ended june compared to the first quarter average interest earning assets increased by billion during the second quarter the increase was primarily driven by a billion increase in average loan balances due to billion of loans acquired form bank leumi usa and continued organic loan growth mainly in the nonppp commercial loan categories as well as residential mortgage loans average interest bearing liabilities increased billion to

balances without stated maturities and million of interest bearing deposits assumed from westchester as compared to the first quarter average interest bearing liabilities increased by billion in the second quarter mainly due to the deposits from bank leumi usa and continued growth in average nonmaturity deposits balances including supplemental growth from commercial depositors a relatively new niche product targeting professional service firms and an increased utilization of shortterm borrowings as part of our funding and liquidity sources total average deposits including noninterest bearing deposits increased billion to billion for the second quarter as compared to the first quarter see additional information under deposits and other borrowings in the executive summary section above our net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis of percent for the second quarter increased by basis points and basis points from percent and percent for the first quarter and second quarter respectively the yield on average interest earning assets increased by basis points on a linked quarter basis mostly due to the aforementioned higher yields on new and adjustable rate loans in the second quarter as compared to the first quarter the yield on average loans increased by basis points to percent for the second quarter as compared to the first quarter largely due to the higher level of market interest rates the yields on average taxable and nontaxable investments also increased basis points and basis points respectively from the first quarter largely due to interest income including discount accretion on investment securities acquired from bank leumi usa the overall cost of average interest bearing liabilities increased basis points to percent for the second quarter as compared to the first quarter the increase was mainly due to moderately higher pricing of nonmaturity deposits combined with greater utilization of brokered deposits and shortterm borrowings in our loan funding mix during the second quarter our cost of total average deposits only increased to percent for the second quarter from percent for the first quarter as noted in the operating environment section above the federal reserve raised the federal funds rate by basis points basis points and basis points in may june and july respectively resulting in a current target range of percent to percent higher levels of market interest rates would benefit certain interest earning assets on our balance sheet and likely provide us the opportunity to reinvest any excess cash including normal repayments of loans and investments at higher rates funding costs also increased during the second quarter and the early stages of the third quarter however at this time we expect a continued benefit to our net interest income from a certain amount of lag in higher funding costs due to the current market and our ability to manage the balance sheet while our outlook for our net interest income for the remainder of is positive we cannot provide any assurances that our net interest income or margin will remain at the levels reported for the second quarter the following table reflects the

origination activity under the loan portfolio section of this mda below other noninterest income increased million and million for the three and six months ended june as compared to the same periods

tax rate was percent percent and percent for the second quarter first quarter and second quarter respectively the increase in the effective tax rate in the second quarter as compared to the first quarter was mainly due to the tax effect of an increase in permanent difference disallowances lower discrete tax items as well as moderate state tax rate adjustments recognized during the second quarter the decrease in income tax expense as compared to the second quarter was mainly due to lower pretax income us gaap requires that any change in judgment or change in measurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period be recognized as a discrete event in the quarter in which it occurs rather than being recognized as a change in effective tax rate for the current year our adherence to these tax guidelines may result in volatile effective income tax rates in future quarterly and annual periods factors that could impact managements judgment include changes in income tax laws and regulations and tax planning strategies based on the current information available we anticipate that our effective tax rate will range from percent to percent for exclusive of pending potential tax rate increases operating segments prior to the second quarter valley operated as four reportable segments consumer lending commercial lending investment management and corporate and other adjustments valley reevaluated its segment reporting during the second quarter to consider the bank leumi usa acquisition on april along with other factors including changes in the internal

consisting of consumer lending commercial lending and treasury and corporate other at june treasury and corporate other was reorganized to consolidate treasury and other corporatewide functions including the treasury managed investment securities portfolios and overnight interest earning cash balances formerly reported under investment management the discrete financial information related to

policies designed to measure consistent and reasonable financial reporting and may result in income and expense measurements that differ from amounts under us gaap furthermore changes in management structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result in changes in reported segment financial data the priorperiod balances reflect reclassifications to conform the presentation in those

automobile loans and to a lesser extent home equity loans secured personal lines of credit and other consumer loans including credit card loans the duration of the residential mortgage loan portfolio which represented percent of our loan portfolio at june is subject to movements in the market level of interest rates and forecasted prepayment speeds the weighted average life of the automobile loans representing percent of total loans at june is relatively unaffected by movements in the market level of interest rates however the average life may be impacted by new loans as a result of the availability of credit within the automobile marketplace and consumer demand for purchasing new or used automobiles consumer lending also includes the wealth management and insurance services division comprised of trust asset management brokerage insurance and tax credit advisory services average interest earning assets in consumer lending increased million to billion for the three months ended june as compared to the second quarter the increase was largely due to solid new and refinanced residential mortgage loan volumes over the last 12month period as well as growth in automobile loans and secured personal lines of credit loans acquired from bank leumi usa on april and westchester on december did not materially impact this operating segment income before income taxes generated by consumer lending decreased million to million for the second quarter as compared to the second quarter largely due to a million increase in the internal transfer expense million increase in the provision for loan losses and lower noninterest income the negative impact of these items was partially offset by a million increase in net interest income the higher internal transfer expense was mostly driven by general increases related to organic growth in our retail business and the recent bank acquisitions the increase in the provision for loan losses was mainly due to higher quantitative reserves for residential mortgage loans as well as loan growth in this category noninterest income decreased million or the second quarter as compared to the second quarter largely due to lower gains on sales of residential mortgage loans the negative impact of these items was partially offset by a million increase in net interest income mainly driven by higher average loan balances the net interest margin on the consumer lending portfolio decreased basis points to percent for the second quarter as compared to the second quarter mainly due to a basis point decrease in the yield on average loans partially offset by a basis point decrease in the costs associated with our funding sou rces the basis point decrease in loan yield was largely due to lower yielding new loan volumes and normal loan repayments over the last 12month period the decrease in our funding costs was mainly due to continued runoff of higher cost time deposits greater mix of noninterest bearing deposits see

timing of loan and investment activity treasury and corporate other recognized pretax losses of million and million for the three months ended june and respectively the million decrease in the pretax loss during the period was due to increases in internal transfer income net interest income and noninterest income that were more than offset by an increase in noninterest expense the internal transfer income increased by million to million for the three months ended june as compared to the same period a year ago mostly due to general increases related to our growth and recent acquisitions noninterest expense increased million to million during the three months ended june as compared to the same period a year ago largely due to million of merger expenses incurred during the second quarter and our expanded banking operations resulting from the bank leumi usa acquisition see further details in the noninterest income and noninterest expense sections of this mda the net interest margin for this segment increased basis points to percent for the for the second quarter as compared to the second quarter due to a basis point increase in the yield on average investments and a basis point decrease in cost of our funding sources the increase in the yield on average investments as compared to the second quarter was largely due to higher interest in come including discount accretion

interest earning assets before tax consumer lending consumer lendings average interest earning assets increased million to billion for the six months ended june as compared to the same period in the increase was largely due to solid new and refinanced residential mortgage loan volumes over the last 12month period as well as growth in automobile loans and secured personal lines of credit income before income taxes generated by consumer lending decreased million to million for the six months ended june as compared to the same period in largely due to a million increase in the internal transfer expense coupled with higher provision for loan losses and noninterest expense the provision for loan losses increased million for the six months ended june from million credit negative provision for the same period of the increase in provision was mainly due to higher reserves related to residential loan growth see further details in the allowance for credit losses section of this mda net interest income increased million primarily due to the lower funding costs as well as additional income generated on higher average loan balances the higher net interest income was largely offset by a million decrease in noninterest income which was mostly attributable to lower net gains on sales of residential mortgage loans for the six months ended june as compared to the same period in net interest margin on the consumer lending portfolio decreased basis points to percent for the six months ended june as compared to the same period one year ago mainly due to a basis point decrease in the yield on average loans partially offset by a basis point decrease in the costs associated with our funding sources the basis point decrease in loan yield was largely due to lower yielding new loan volumes prior to the second quarter and normal loan repayments the decrease in our funding costs was mainly due to a greater mix of noninterest bearing deposits deposits continuing to reprice at lower interest rates prior to the second quarter and the repayment of maturing higher cost borrowings commercial lending average interest earning assets in commercial lending increased billion to billion for the six months ended june as compared to the same period in this increase was primarily due to strong organic loan growth over the 12month period ended june as well as loans acquired from bank leumi usa and westchester for the six months ended june income before income taxes for commercial lending decreased million to million as compared to the same period in mainly driven by increases in i nternal transfer expense and provision for loan losses largely offset by higher net interest income and noninterest income internal transfer expense increased million to million for the six months ended june as compared to the same period in t he provision for credit losses increased million to million during the six months ended june as compared to million for the

details the negative impa ct of the aforementioned items w as largely offset by increases in net interest income and noninterest inc ome net interest income increased million to million for the six months ended june as compared to the same period in largely due to higher average commercial loan balances during the period noninterest income increased million for the six months ended june as compared to the same period in primarily due to a million increase in fee income related to derivative interest rate swaps executed with commercial loan customers the net interest margin for this segment increased basis points to percent for the six months ended june as compared to the same period in due to a basis point decrease in the cost of our funding sources partially offset by a basis point decrease in yield on average loans treasury and corporate other treasury and corporate others average interest earning assets increased million during the six months ended june as compared to the same period in within the category a billion increase in taxable investment securities was partially offset by a million decrease in average interest bearing deposits with banks the increase in the average investment securities balance was mainly due to billion of investment securities acquired from bank leumi usa the lower levels of excess liquidity were mainly due to the strong organic loan growth over the last 12month period the pretax net loss for this segment totaled million for the six months ended june as compared to million for the same period in the positive change of million was mainly due to increases in internal transfer income and noninterest income partially offset by higher noninterest expense internal transfer income increased million to million for the six months ended june as compared to the same period in the increase in net interest income totaled million and was mostly driven by higher yields and average investment balances noninterest expense increased million to million for the six months ended june as compared to the same period in partially due to million of merger expenses incurred during the second quarter and other increases in expenses related to our expanded banking operations and organic business growth partially offset by the l oss on extinguishment of debt recorded during the comparative period see further details in the noninterest income and noninterest expense sections of this mda treasury and corporate others net interest margin increased basis points to percent for the six months ended june as compared to the same period in due to a basis point increase in the yield on average investments and a basis point decrease in cost of our funding sources the increase in the yield on average investments as compared to the same period in was largely driven by the higher amortization expense in the prior year caused in part by acceleration of principal repayments in the low interest rate environment mostly during the second half of assetliability management interest rate sensitivity our success is largely dependent upon our ability to manage interest rate risk interest rate risk can be defined as the exposure of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities to the movement in interest rates our assetliability management committee is responsible for managing such risks and establishing policies that monitor and coordinate our sources and uses of funds assetliability management is a continuous process due to the constant change in interest rate risk factors in assessing the appropriate interest rate risk levels for us management weighs the potential benefit of each risk management activity within the desired parameters of liquidity capital levels and managements tolerance for exposure to income fluctuations many of the actions undertaken by management utilize fair value analysis and attempt to achieve consistent accounting and economic benefits for financial assets and their related funding sources we have predominantly focused on managing our interest rate risk by attempting to match the inherent risk and cash flows of financial assets and liabilities specifically management employs multiple risk management activities such as optimizing the level of new residential mortgage originations retained in our mortgage portfolio through increasing or decreasing loan sales in the secondary market product pricing levels the desired maturity levels for new originations the composition levels of both our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as well as several other risk management activities we use a simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity to movements in interest rates the simulation model projects net interest income based on various interest rate scenarios over a 12month and 24month period the model is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of rate sensitive assets and liabilities the model incorporates certain assumptions which management believes to be reasonable regarding the impact of changing interest rates and the prepayment assumptions of certain assets and liabilities as of june the model assumes immediate changes in interest rates without any proactive change in the composition or size of the balance sheet or other future actions that management might undertake to mitigate this risk in the model the forecasted shape of the yield curve remains static as of june the impact of interest rate derivatives such as interest rate swaps is also included in the model our simulation model is based on market interest rates and prepayment speeds prevalent in the market as of june although the size of valleys balance sheet is forecasted to remain static as of june in our model the composition is adjusted to reflect new interest earning assets and funding originations coupled with rate spreads utilizing our actual originations during the second quarter the model also utilizes an immediate parallel shift in market interest rates at june the assumptions used in the net interest income simulation are inherently uncertain actual results may differ significantly from those presented in the table below due to the frequency and timing of changes in interest rates and changes in spreads between maturity and repricing categories overall our net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates and cash flows from our loan and investment portfolios we actively manage these cash flows in conjunction with our liability mix duration and interest rates to optimize the net interest income while structuring the balance sheet in response to actual or potential changes in interest rates additionally our net interest income is impacted by the level of competition within our marketplace competition can negatively impact the level of interest rates attainable on loans and increase the cost of deposits which may result in downward pressure on our net interest margin in future periods other factors including but not limited to the slope of the yield curve and projected cash flows will impact our net interest income results and may increase or decrease the level of asset sensitivity of our balance sheet convexity is a measure of how the duration of a financial instrument changes as market interest rates change potential movements in the convexity of bonds held in our investment portfolio as well as the duration of the loan portfolio may have a positive or negative impact on our net interest income in varying interest rate environments as a result the increase or decrease in forecasted net interest income may not have a linear relationship to the results reflected in the table below management cannot provide any assurance about the actual effect of changes in interest rates on our net interest income the following table reflects managements expectations of the change in our net interest income over the next month period considering the aforementioned assumptions while an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this simulation model we believe that any actual shift in interest rates would likely be more gradual and would therefore have a more modest impact than shown in the table below estimated change in future net interest income changes in interest rates dollar change percentage change in basis points in thousands as noted in the table above a basis point immediate increase in interest rates combined with a static balance sheet where the size mix and proportions of assets and liabilities remain unchanged is projected to increase net interest income over the next month period by percent management believes the interest rate sensitivity remains within an acceptable tolerance range at june however the level of net interest income sensitivity may increase or decrease in the future as a result of several factors including potential changes in our balance sheet strategies the slope of the yield curve and projected cash flows liquidity and cash requirements bank liquidity liquidity measures the ability to satisfy current and future cash flow needs as they become due a banks liquidity reflects its ability to meet loan demand to accommodate possible outflows in deposits and to take advantage of interest rate opportunities in the marketplace liquidity management is carefully performed and routinely reported by our treasury department to two board committees among other actions treasury reviews historical funding requirements our current liquidity position sources and stability of funding marketability of assets options for attracting additional funds and anticipated future funding needs including the level of unfunded commitments our goal is to maintain sufficient liquidity to cover current and potential funding requirements the bank has no required regulatory liquidity ratios to maintain however it adheres to an internal liquidity policy the current policy maintains that we may not have a ratio of loans to deposits in ex cess of percent or reliance on wholesale funding greater than percent of total funding the bank was in compliance with the foregoing policies at june valleys short and longterm cash requirements include contractual obligations under borrowings deposits payment related to leases capital expenditures and other purchase commitments in the ordinary course of operations the bank also enters into various financial obligations including contractual obligations that may require future cash payments management believes the bank has the ability to generate and obtain adequate amounts of cash to meet its shortterm and longterm obligations as they come due by utilizing various cash resources described below on the asset side of the balance sheet the bank has numerous sources of liquid funds in the form of cash and due from banks interest bearing deposits with banks including the federal reserve bank of new york investment securities held to maturity that are maturing within days or would otherwise qualify as maturities if sold ie percent of original cost basis has been repaid investment securities classified as trading and available for sale loans held for sale and from time to time federal funds sold and receivables related to unsettled securities transactions total liquid assets were approximate ly billion representing percent of earning assets at june and billion representing percent of earning assets at december of the billion of liquid assets at june approximately million of various investment securities were pledged to counterparties to support our earning asset funding strategies we anticipate the receipt of approx imately billion in principal payments from securities in the total investment portfolio at june over the next month period due to normally scheduled principal repayments and expected prepayments of certain securities primarily residential mortgagebacked securities additional liquidity is derived from scheduled loan payments of principal and interest as well as prepayments received loan principal payments from total loans and loans held for sale at june are projected in accordance with their scheduled contractual terms to be approximately billion over the next month period as a contingency plan for any liquidity constraints liquidity could also be derived from the sale of conforming residential mortgages from our loan portfolio or alleviated from the temporary curtail ment of lending activities on the liability side of the balance sheet we utilize multiple sources of funds to meet liquidity needs including retail and commercial deposits brokered and municipal deposits and shortterm and longterm borrowings our core deposit base which generally excludes fully insured brokered deposits and both retail and brokered certificates of deposit over thousand represents the largest of these sources average core deposits totaled approximately billion and billion for the six months ended june and for the year ended december respectively representing percent and percent of average earning assets for the respective periods the level of interest bearing deposits is affected by interest rates offered which is often influenced by our need for funds and the need to match the maturities of assets and liabilities additional funding may be provided through deposit gathering networks and in the form of federal funds purchased through our well established relationships with numerous banks while these lending lines are uncommitted management believes that the bank could borrow approximately billion from these banks on a collective basis the bank is also a member of the federal home loan bank of new york fhlb and has the ability to borrow from them in the form of fhlb advances secured by pledges of certain eligible collateral including but not limited to us government and agency mortgagebacked securities and a blanket assignment of qualifying first lien mortgage loans consisting of both residential mortgage and commercial real estate loans additionally valleys collateral pledged to the fhlb may be used to obtain municipal letters of credit muloc to collateralize certain municipal deposits held by valley at june valley had billion of mulocs outstanding for this purpose furthermore we can obtain overnight borrowings from the federal reserve bank of new york via the discount window as a contingency for additional liquidity at june our borrowing capacity under the federal reserve banks discount window was billion we also have access to other shortterm and longterm borrowing sources to support our asset base such as repos ie securities sold under agreements to repurchase shortterm borrowings consisting of fhlb advances repos and from time to time federal funds purchased decreased approximately million to billion at june as compared to december largely due to normal repayments of fhlb advances partially offset by million of federal funds purchased at june corporation liquidity valleys recurring cash requirements primarily consist of dividends to preferred and common shareholders and interest expense on subordinated notes and junior subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts as part of our ongoing assetliability management strategies valley could also use cash to repurchase shares of its outstanding common stock under its share repurchase program or redeem its callable junior subordinated debentures and subordinated notes valleys cash needs are routinely satisfied by dividends collected from the bank projected cash flows from the bank are expected to be adequate to pay preferred and common dividends if declared and interest expense payable to subordinated note holders and capital trusts given the current capital levels and current profitable operations of the bank in addition to dividends received from the bank valley can satisfy its cash requirements by utilizing its own cash and potential new funds borrowed from outside sources or capital issuances valley also has the right to defer interest payments on the junior subordinated debentures and therefore distributions on its trust preferred securities for consecutive quarterly periods up to five years but not beyond the stated maturity dates and subject to other conditions investment securities portfolio as of june we had million billion and billion in equity available for sale and held to maturity debt securities respectively there were no trading debt securities at june the equity securities consisted of two publicly traded mutual funds cra investments and several other equity investments we have made in companies that develop new financial technologies and in a partnership that invests in such companies our cra and other equity investments are a mix of both publicly traded entities and privately held entities the available for sale and held to maturity debt securities portfolios which comprise the majority of the securities we own include us treasury securities us government agency securities taxexempt and taxable issuances of states and political subdivisions residential mortgagebacked securities singleissuer trust preferred securities principally issued by bank holding companies and high quality corporate bonds among other securities our available for sale debt securities include securities such as bank issued and other corporate bonds as well as municipal special revenue bonds that may pose a higher risk of future impairment charges to us as a result of the uncertain economic environment and its potential negative effect on the future performance of the security issuers we acquired million million and million of equity securities available for sale debt and held to maturity debt securities respectively from bank leumi usa on april allowance for credit losses and impairment analysis available for sale debt securities available for sale debt securities in unrealized loss positions are evaluated for impairment related to credit losses at least quarterly in assessing whether a credit loss exists we compare the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security with the amortized cost basis of the security if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis for the security a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded limited to the amount the fair value is less than amortized cost basis declines in fair value that have not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses such as declines due to changes in market interest rates are recorded through other comprehensive income net of applicable taxes we have evaluated all available for sale debt securities that are in an unrealized loss position as of june and december and determined that the declines in fair value were mainly attributable to changes in market volatility due to factors such as interest rates and spread factors but not attributable to credit quality or other factors based on a comparison of the present value of expected cash flows to the amortized cost management recognized no impairment charges during the three and six months ended june and the year ended december as a result there was no allowance for credit losses for available for sale debt securities at june and december held to maturity debt securities valley estimates the expected credit losses on held to maturity debt securities that have loss expectations using a discounted cash flow model developed by a third party valley has a zero loss expectation for certain securities within the held to maturity portfolio including us treasury securities us agency

securities that have loss expectations valley estimates the expected credit losses using a discounted cash flow model developed by a third party assumptions used in the model for pools of securities with common risk characteristics include the historical lifetime probability of default and severity of loss in the event of default with the model incorporating several economic cycles of loss history data to calculate expected credit losses given default at the individual security level held to maturity debt securities were carried net of an allowance for credit losses totaling approximately million and million at june and december respectively there were no net chargeoffs of held to maturity debt securities for the three and six months ended june and investment grades the investment grades in the table below reflect the most current independent analysis performed by third parties of each security as of the date presented and not necessarily the investment grades at the date of our purchase of the securities for many securities the rating agencies may not have performed an independent analysis of the tranches owned by us but rather an analysis of the entire investment pool for this and other reasons we believe the assigned investment grades may not accurately reflect the actual credit quality of each security and should not be viewed in isolation as a measure of the quality of our investment portfolio the following table presents the held to maturity and available for sale debt securities portfolios by investment grades at june june amortized cost

categories of both the held to maturity and available for sale debt securities portfolios in the above table were mainly related to residential mortgagebacked securities issued by ginnie mae fannie mae and freddie mac and were driven by the rising interest rate environment during the second quarter the investment securities held to maturity portfolio included million of investments not rated by

commercial and industrial commercial real estate residential mortgage consumer loans total includes net unearned discount and deferred loan fees of million million and million at june march and december respectively the linked quarter increase was largely due to a million net purchase discount associated with the loans acquired from bank leumi usa on april total loans increased billion to

second quarter commercial and industrial loans increased billion to billion at june as compared to march excluding billion of loan acquired from bank leumi usa and ppp loans the noncommercial and industrial loan organic growth totaled million during the second quarter mainly due to the solid new loan pipeline in most of our markets driven by direct calling efforts of our growing commercial lending team the ppp loans decreased million to million at june compared to million at march mainly due to loan forgiveness repayments partially offset by million of ppp loans acquired from bank leumi usa commercial real estate loans excluding construction loans increased billion to billion at june from march excluding billion of loans acquired from bank leumi usa the approximate million increase was driven by solid organic growth across most of our geographic footprints construction loans increased billion to billion at june from march due in part to approximately million of loans acquired from bank leumi usa and higher volume of advances on new and to a lesser extent preexisting loan projects during the second quarter residential mortgage loans increased million or percent on an annualized basis during the second quarter primarily due to new loan activity in the purchased home market and an increase in such loans originated for investment rather than sale residential mortgage loans acquired from bank leumi usa were not material new and refinanced residential mortgage loans totaled million for the second quarter as compared to million and million for the first quarter and second quarter respectively florida originations totaled approximately million and represented percent of total residential mortgage loan originations in the quarter of the total originations in the second quarter only million of residential mortgage loans were originated for sale rather than held for investment as compared to million during the first quarter during the second quarter we retained approximately percent of the total residential mortgages originations in our held for investment loan portfolio we sold approximately million of residential mortgage loans held for sale during the second quarter we may continue to retain a higher percentage of new loan volumes during the third quarter due to several factors including consumer demand and preferences for certain mortgage products and our management of the interest rate risk and the mix of the interest earning assets on our balance sheet additionally refinanced loan applications continue to be a low percentage of our volume in the early stages of the third quarter due to the increase in the level of mortgage interest rates and may challenge our ability to grow this loan category home equity loans increased by million to million at june compared to march new home equity loan volumes and customer usage of existing home equity lines of credit continue to be modest and challenged by a less favorable rising interest rate environment automobile loans increased by million or percent on an annualized basis to billion at june as compared to march as loan originations volumes outpaced loan repayments during the second quarter loan originations were mainly driven by high consumer demand for vehicle purchases and our competitive rates offered for new and used car financing w e originated million in auto loans through our dealership network during the second quarter as compared to million in the fourth quarter of the total originations our florida dealership network contributed million in auto loan originations representing approximately percent of new loans during the second quarter the current low levels of new and used automobile inventories and rising interest rates could negatively impact our auto loan growth during the third quarter other consumer loans increased million to billion at june from march a large part of our lendin g is in northern and central new jersey new york city long island and florida to mitigate our geographic risks we make efforts to maintain a diversified portfolio as to type of borrower and loan to guard against a potential downward turn in any one economic sector for the remainder of we anticipate strong organic commercial and industrial nonppp and commercial real estate loan growth in the early stages of the third quarter we are encouraged that our commercial loan origination pipelines remain robust and overall loan growth should remain welldiversified across our markets in our commercial loan categories based upon current projections we anticipate to percent annualized loan growth for the second half of however there can be no assurance that those positive trends will continue or balances will not decline from june given the forecasted slowdown of the us economy growth due to several factors including the russiaukraine war persistently high inflation and the impact of the federal reserves rapid monetary policy tightening in addition w e anticipate that consumer loan activity will slow meaningfully for the remainder of the year nonperforming assets nonperforming assets npa include nonaccrual loans other real estate owned oreo and other repossessed assets which primarily consists of automobiles and taxi medallions at june loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when they become past due in excess of days as to payment of principal or interest exceptions to the nonaccrual policy may be permitted if the loan is sufficiently collateralized and in the process of collection oreo is acquired through foreclosure on loans secured by land or real estate oreo and other repossessed assets are reported at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated cost to sell our npas increased million to million at june as compared to march mostly due to million of acquired nonaccrual loans from bank leumi usa npas as a percentage of total loans and npas totaled percent and percent at june and march respectively as shown in the table below we believe our total npas has remained relatively low as a percentage of the total loan portfolio and the level of npas is reflective of our consistent approach to the loan underwriting criteria for both valley originated loans and loans purchased from third parties for additional details see the credit quality indicators section in note to the consolidated financial statements our lending strategy is based on underwriting standards designed to maintain high credit quality and we remain optimistic regarding the overall future performance of our loan portfolio during and the first half of our overall credit trends remained stable and our business and borrowers continued to demonstrate resilience and growth despite the continuing challenges of the covid19 pandemic and the uncertain economy however management cannot provide assurance that the nonperforming assets will not increase substantially from the levels reported at june due to high inflation aggressive tightening

delinquencies mostly due to one loan acquired from bank leumi usa included in this category at june loans past due to days decreased million to million at june as compared to march commercial and industrial within this delinquency category decreased million largely due to the migration of loans totaling million to the days or more past due category at june commercial real estate loans delinquencies decreased million at june mainly due to a million loan included in this delinquency category at march that became current as to all contractual payments at june loans past due days or

million from the to days past due category at june all of the loans past due days or more and still accruing interest reported at june are considered to be wellsecured and in the process of collection nonaccrual loans increased million to million at june as compared to million at march commercial and industrial loans increased million mainly due to a million borrower relationship with related reserves of million within the allowance for loan losses at june construction loan delinquencies increased million mainly due to two loan relationships acquired from bank leumi usa the million increase in nonaccrual commercial real estate loans was mainly due to the aforementioned million nonperforming loan at june that was previously reported in the to days past due delinquency category at

york city medallions had related reserve s of million or percent of such l oans the tax medallion loans and related reserves remained relatively unchanged from march potential declines in the market valuation of taxi medallions and the stressed operating environment mainly within new york city due to the covid19 pandemic could negatively impact the future performance of this portfolio for example

allowance for credit losses for loans the allowance for credit losses acl for loans includes the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments under cecl our methodology to establish the allowance for loan losses has two basic components i a collective reserve component for estimated expected credit losses for pools of loans that share common risk characteristics and ii an individual reserve component for loans that do not share risk characteristics consisting of collateral dependent tdr and expected tdr loans valley also maintains a separate allowance for unfunded credit commitments mainly consisting of undisbursed noncancellable lines of credit new loan commitments and commercial standby letters of credit valley estimated the collective acl using a current expected credit losses methodology which is based on relevant information about historical experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the loan balances in estimating the component of the allowance on a collective basis we use a transition matrix model which calculates an expected life of loan loss percentage for each loan pool by generating probability of default and loss given default metrics the metrics are based on the migration of loans from performing to loss by credit quality rating or delinquency categories using historical lifeofloan analysis periods for each loan portfolio pool and the severity of loss based on the aggregate net lifetime losses the models expected losses based on loss history are adjusted for qualitative factors among other things these adjustments include and account for differences in i the impact of the reasonable and supportable economic forecast relative probability weightings and reversion period ii other asset specific risks to the extent they do not exist in the historical loss information and iii net expected recoveries of chargedoff loan balances these adjustments are based on qualitative factors not reflected in the quantitative model but are likely to impact the measurement of estimated credit losses the expected lifetime loss rate is the life of loan loss percentage from the transition matrix model plus the impact of the adjustments for qualitative factors the expected credit losses are the product of multiplying the models expected lifetime loss rate by the exposure at default at period end on an undiscounted basis valley utilizes a twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period followed by a oneyear period over which estimated losses revert to historical loss experience for the remaining life of the loan on a straightline basis the forecasts consist of a multiscenario economic forecast model to estimate future credit losses and is governed by a crossfunctional committee the committee meets each quarter to determine which economic scenarios developed by moodys will be incorporated into the model as well as the relative probability weightings of the selected scenarios based upon all readily available information the model projects economic variables under each scenario based on detailed statistical analyses we have identified and selected key variables that most closely correlated to our historical credit performance which include gdp unemployment and the caseshiller home price index for the second quarter we incorporated a probability weighted threescenario economic forecast including moodys baseline s3 and s4 scenarios at june valley maintained the majority of its probability weighting to the moodys baseline scenario with less emphasis on the s3 downside and s4 most adverse scenarios relatively consistent with its weighting in the march acl analysis however the baseline forecast and weighting at june reflects a less optimistic outlook than at march in terms of gdp growth and unemployment levels and potential near term negative economic impacts given present uncertain economic conditions at june the moodys baseline forecast included the following specific assumptions gdp expansion by about percent in the third quarter unemployment of percent in the third quarter and to percent over the
