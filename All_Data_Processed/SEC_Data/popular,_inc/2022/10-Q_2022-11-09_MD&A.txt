availableforsale risk management market interest rate risk the financial results and capital levels of the corporation are constantly exposed to market interest rate and liquidity risks market risk refers to the risk of a reduction in the corporations capital due to changes in the market valuation of its assets andor liabilities most of the assets subject to market valuation risk are debt securities classified as availableforsale refer to notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the debt securities availableforsale and heldtomaturity portfolios debt securities classified as availableforsale amounted to billion as of september other assets subject to market risk include loans heldforsale which amounted to million mortgage servicing rights msrs which amounted to million and securities classified as trading which amounted to million as of september interest rate risk irr the corporations net interest income is subject to various categories of interest rate risk including repricing basis yield curve and option risks in managing interest rate risk management may alter the mix of floating and fixed rate assets and liabilities change pricing schedules adjust maturities through sales and purchases of investment securities and enter into derivative contracts among other alternatives interest rate risk management is an active process that encompasses monitoring loan and deposit flows complemented by investment and funding activities effective management of interest rate risk begins with understanding the dynamic characteristics of assets and liabilities and determining the appropriate rate risk position given line of business forecasts management objectives market expectations and policy constraints management utilizes various tools to assess irr including net interest income nii simulation modeling static gap analysis and economic value of equity eve the three methodologies complement each other and are used jointly in the evaluation of the corporations irr nii simulation modeling is prepared for a fiveyear period which in conjunction with the eve analysis provides management a better view of longterm irr net interest income simulation analysis performed by legal entity and on a consolidated basis is a tool used by the corporation in estimating the potential change in net interest income resulting from hypothetical changes in interest rates sensitivity analysis is calculated using a simulation model which incorporates actual balance sheet figures detailed by maturity and interest yields or costs management assesses interest rate risk by comparing various nii simulations under different interest rate scenarios that differ in direction of interest rate changes the degree of change and the projected shape of the yield curve for example the types of rate scenarios processed during the quarter include flat rates implied forwards and parallel and nonparallel rate shocks management also performs analyses to isolate and measure basis and prepayment risk exposures the asset and liability management group performs validation procedures on various assumptions used as part of the simulation analyses as well as validations of results on a monthly basis in addition the model and processes used to assess irr are subject to independent validations according to the guidelines established in the model governance and validation policy the corporation processes nii simulations under interest rate scenarios in which the yield curve is assumed to rise and decline by the same magnitude parallel shifts the rate scenarios considered in these market risk simulations reflect instantaneous parallel changes of and basis points during the succeeding twelvemonth period simulation analyses are based on many assumptions including relative levels of market interest rates across all yield curve points and indexes interest rate spreads loan prepayments and deposit elasticity thus they should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results further the estimates do not contemplate actions that management could take to respond to changes in interest rates additionally the company is also subject to basis risk in the repricing of its assets and liabilities including the basis related to using different rate indexes for the repricing of assets and liabilities as well as the effect of pricing lags which may be contractual or due to historical differences in the timing of management responses to changes in the rate environment by their nature these forwardlooking computations are only estimates and may be different from what may actually occur in the future the following table presents the results of the simulations at september and december assuming a static balance sheet and parallel changes over flat spot rates over a oneyear time horizon table net interest income sensitivity one year projection september december  in thousands amount change percent change amount change percent change change in interest rate basis points basis points basis points basis points basis points as of september nii simulations show the corporation has a neutral to slightly liability sensitive position driven by the rapid increase in shortterm interest rates throughout the year and its impact on puerto rico public sector deposits which are indexed to market rates as well as the deployment of cash to fund loan growth and purchase investments these results suggest that changes in net interest income are driven by changes in liability costs primarily puerto rico public sector deposits in declining rate scenarios net interest income would increase as the decline in the cost of these deposits generates a greater benefit than the changes in asset yields in rising rate scenarios populars sensitivity profile is also impacted by its large proportion of puerto rico public sector deposits which are indexed to market rates as shortterm rates have risen the cost of these deposits now increases in sync with market rates and therefore reduce the benefit banks typically have in rising rate environments as of september popular has a more neutral position as compared to a substantially asset sensitive position as of december the primary reasons for the reduction in sensitivity are i the realization of much of the expected benefit in net interest income given the higher interest rates observed during the first nine months of ii a decrease in cash balances which reprice instantaneously via the deployment into longer term investments and loans and iii the market indexed nature of puerto rico public sector deposits which represented billion or of deposits as of september the corporations loan and investment portfolios are subject to prepayment risk which results from the ability of a thirdparty to repay debt obligations prior to maturity prepayment risk also could have a significant impact on the duration of mortgagebacked securities and collateralized mortgage obligations since prepayments could shorten or lower prepayments could extend the weighted average life of these portfolios trading the corporation engages in trading activities in the ordinary course of business at its subsidiaries bppr and popular securities popular securities trading activities consist primarily of marketmaking activities to meet expected customers needs related to its retail brokerage business and purchases and sales of us government and government sponsored securities with the objective of realizing gains from expected shortterm price movements bpprs trading activities consist primarily of holding us government sponsored mortgagebacked securities classified as trading and hedging the related market risk with tba tobeannounced market transactions the objective is to derive spread income from the portfolio and not to benefit from shortterm market movements in addition bppr uses forward contracts or tbas to hedge its securitization pipeline risks related to variations in interest rates and market volatility are hedged with tbas that have characteristics similar to that of the forecasted security and its conversion timeline at september and december the corporation held trading securities with a fair value of million representing approximately of the corporations total assets as shown in table the trading portfolio consists principally of mortgagebacked securities and us treasuries which at september were investment grade securities as of september and december the trading portfolio also included million in puerto rico government obligations trading instruments are recognized at fair value with changes resulting from fluctuations in market prices interest rates or exchange rates reported in current period earnings the

obligations interestonly strips total not on a taxable equivalent basis the corporations trading activities are limited by internal policies for each of the two subsidiaries the market risk assumed under trading activities is measured by the 5day net valueatrisk var with a confidence level of the var measures the maximum estimated loss that may occur over a 5day holding period given a probability the corporations trading portfolio had a 5day var of approximately million for the last week in september there are numerous assumptions and estimates associated with var modeling and actual results could differ from these assumptions and estimates backtesting is performed to compare actual results against maximum estimated losses in order to evaluate model and assumptions accuracy in the opinion of management the size and composition of the trading portfolio does not represent a significant source of market risk for the corporation liquidity the objective of effective liquidity management is to ensure that the corporation has sufficient liquidity to meet all of its financial obligations finance expected future growth fund planned capital distributions and maintain a reasonable safety margin for cash commitments under both normal and stressed market conditions the board of directors is responsible for establishing the corporations tolerance for liquidity risk including approving relevant risk limits and policies the board of directors has delegated the monitoring of these risks to the boards risk management committee and the assetliability management committee the management of liquidity risk on a longterm and daytoday basis is the responsibility of the corporate treasury division the corporations corporate treasurer is responsible for implementing the policies and procedures approved by the board of directors and for monitoring the corporations liquidity position on an ongoing basis also the corporate treasury division coordinates corporate wide liquidity management strategies and activities with the reportable segments oversees policy breaches and manages the escalation process the financial and operational risk management division is responsible for the independent monitoring and reporting of adherence with established policies an institutions liquidity may be pressured if for example it experiences a sudden and unexpected substantial cash outflow due to exogenous events such as the covid19 pandemic its credit rating is downgraded or some other event causes counterparties to avoid exposure to the institution factors that the corporation does not control such as the economic outlook adverse ratings of its principal markets and regulatory changes could also affect its ability to obtain funding liquidity is managed by the corporation at the level of the holding companies that own the banking and nonbanking subsidiaries it is also managed at the level of the banking and nonbanking subsidiaries as further explained below a principal source of liquidity for the bank holding companies the bhcs are dividends received from banking and nonbanking subsidiaries the corporation has adopted policies and limits to monitor more effectively the corporations liquidity position and that of the banking subsidiaries additionally contingency funding plans are used to model various stress events of different magnitudes and affecting different time horizons that assist management in evaluating the size of the liquidity buffers needed if those stress events occur however such models may not predict accurately how the market and customers might react to every event and are dependent on many assumptions deposits including customer deposits brokered deposits and public funds deposits continue to be the most significant source of funds for the corporation funding of the corporations total assets at september and at december the ratio of total ending loans to deposits was at september compared to at december in addition to traditional deposits the corporation maintains borrowing arrangements which amounted to approximately billion in outstanding balances at september december billion a detailed description of the corporations borrowings including their terms is included in note to the consolidated financial statements also the consolidated statements of cash flows in the accompanying consolidated financial statements provide information on the corporations cash inflows and outflows on july the corporation completed its previously announced accelerated share repurchase program for the repurchase of an aggregate million of populars common stock in addition during the quarter ended september the corporation entered into a million asr and received an initial delivery of  of common stock refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information the following sections provide further information on the corporations major funding activities and needs as well as the risks involved in these activities banking subsidiaries primary sources of funding for the corporations banking subsidiaries bppr and pb or collectively the banking subsidiaries include retail commercial and public sector deposits brokered deposits unpledged investment securities mortgage loan securitization and to a lesser extent loan sales in addition the corporation maintains borrowing facilities with the fhlb and at the discount window of the federal reserve bank of new york the frb and has a considerable amount of collateral pledged that can be used to raise funds under these facilities refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information of the corporations borrowing facilities available through its banking subsidiaries the principal uses of funds for the banking subsidiaries include loan originations investment portfolio purchases loan purchases and repurchases repayment of outstanding obligations including deposits advances on certain serviced portfolios and operational expenses also the banking subsidiaries assume liquidity risk related to collateral posting requirements for certain activities mainly in connection with contractual commitments recourse provisions servicing advances derivatives credit card licensing agreements and support to several mutual funds administered by bppr the banking subsidiaries maintain sufficient funding capacity to address large increases in funding requirements such as deposit outflows the corporation has established liquidity guidelines that require the banking subsidiaries to have sufficient liquidity to cover all shortterm borrowings and a portion of deposits the corporations ability to compete successfully in the marketplace for deposits excluding brokered deposits depends on various factors including pricing service convenience and financial stability as reflected by operating results credit ratings by nationally recognized credit rating agencies and importantly fdic deposit insurance although a downgrade in the credit ratings of the corporations banking subsidiaries may impact their ability to raise retail and commercial deposits or the rate that it is required to pay on such deposits management does not believe that the impact should be material deposits at all of the corporations banking subsidiaries are federally insured subject to fdic limits and this is expected to mitigate the potential effect of a downgrade in the credit ratings deposits are a key source of funding as they tend to be less volatile than institutional borrowings and their cost is less sensitive to changes in market rates refer to table for a breakdown of deposits by major types core deposits are generated from a large base of consumer corporate and public sector customers core deposits include all noninterest bearing deposits savings deposits and certificates of deposit under excluding brokered deposits with denominations under core deposits have historically provided the corporation with a sizable source of relatively stable and lowcost funds core deposits totaled billion or of total deposits at september compared with billion or of total deposits at december core deposits financed of the corporations earning assets at september compared with at december the distribution by maturity of certificates of deposits with denominations of and over at september is presented in the table that follows table distribution by maturity of certificate of deposits of and over in thousands months or less over to months over year to years over years total the corporation had billion in brokered deposits at september which financed approximately of its total assets december billion and respectively in the event that any of the corporations banking subsidiaries regulatory capital ratios fall below those required by a wellcapitalized institution or are subject to capital restrictions by the regulators that banking subsidiary faces the risk of not being able to raise or maintain brokered deposits and faces limitations on the rate paid on deposits which may hinder the corporations ability to effectively compete in its retail markets and could affect its deposit raising efforts deposits from the public sector represent an important source of funds for the corporation as of september total public sector deposits were billion compared to billion at december these include billion transferred out of bppr at the beginning of october and exclude million in deposits managed by the corporations fiduciary services division where it acts as custodian or escrow agent generally these deposits require that the bank pledge high credit quality securities as collateral therefore liquidity risks arising from public sector deposit outflows are lower given that the bank receives its collateral in return this now unpledged collateral can either be financed via repurchase agreements or sold for cash however there are some timing differences between the time the deposit outflow occurs and when the bank receives its collateral additionally the corporation mainly utilizes fixedrate us treasury debt securities as collateral while these securities have limited credit risk they are subject to market value risk based on changes in the interest rate environment when interest rates increase the value of this collateral decreases and could result in the corporation having to provide additional collateral to cover the same amount of deposit liabilities this additional collateral could reduce unpledged securities otherwise available as liquidity sources to the corporation at september management believes that the banking subsidiaries had sufficient current and projected liquidity sources to meet their anticipated cash flow obligations as well as special needs and offbalance sheet commitments in the ordinary course of business and have sufficient liquidity resources to address a stress event although the banking subsidiaries have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances no assurance can be given that they would be able to replace those funds in the future if the corporations financial condition or general market conditions were to deteriorate the corporations financial flexibility will be severely constrained if the banking subsidiaries are unable to maintain access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future financing needs at acceptable interest rates the banking subsidiaries also are required to deposit cash or qualifying securities to meet margin requirements on repurchase agreements and other collateralized borrowing facilities to the extent that the value of securities previously pledged as collateral declines because of market changes the corporation will be required to deposit additional cash or securities to meet its margin requirements thereby adversely affecting its liquidity finally if management is required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to meet its future growth revenues may not increase proportionately to cover costs in this case profitability would be adversely affected bank holding companies the principal sources of funding for the bhcs which are popular inc holding company only and pna include cash on hand investment securities dividends received from banking and nonbanking subsidiaries asset sales credit facilities available from affiliate banking subsidiaries and proceeds from potential securities offerings dividends from banking and nonbanking subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory limits and authorization requirements that are further described below and that may limit the ability of those subsidiaries to act as a source of funding to the bhcs the principal use of these funds includes the repayment of debt and interest payments to holders of senior debt and junior subordinated deferrable interest related to trust preferred securities the payment of dividends to common stockholders repurchases of the corporations securities and capitalizing its banking subsidiaries the outstanding balance of notes payable at the bhcs amounted to million at september and million at december the contractual maturities of the bhcs notes payable at september are presented in table table distribution of bhcs notes payable by contractual maturity year in thousands later years total the corporations unsecured senior debt securities mature in the september of annual debt service at the bhcs is approximately million and the corporations latest quarterly dividend was per share or approximately million per quarter the bhcs liquidity position continues to be adequate with sufficient cash on hand investments and other sources of liquidity which are expected to be enough to meet all bhcs debt service and dividend obligations during the foreseeable future as of september the bhcs had cash and money markets investments totaling million and borrowing potential of million from its secured facility with bppr the bhcs have in the past borrowed in the corporate debt market primarily to finance their nonbanking subsidiaries and refinance debt obligations these sources of funding are more costly due to the fact that two out of the three principal credit rating agencies rate the corporation below investment grade which affects the corporations cost and ability to raise funds in the capital markets factors that the corporation does not control such as the economic outlook interest rate volatility inflation disruptions in the debt market among others could also affect its ability to obtain funding the corporation has an automatic shelf registration statement filed and effective with the securities and exchange commission which permits the corporation to issue an unspecified amount of debt or equity securities on july the corporation exchanged a portion of evertec shares as part of a transaction in which it acquired certain critical channels from evertec and renegotiated several service agreements the corporation completed the sale of its remaining shares of evertec on august following the evertec stock sale popular no longer owns any evertec common stock nonbanking subsidiaries the principal sources of funding for the nonbanking subsidiaries include internally generated cash flows from operations loan sales repurchase agreements capital injections and borrowed funds from their direct parent companies or the holding companies the principal uses of funds for the nonbanking subsidiaries include repayment of maturing debt operational expenses and payment of dividends to the bhcs the liquidity needs of the nonbanking subsidiaries are minimal since

creditworthiness leverage ratios and other regulatory requirements among other factors derivatives such as those embedded in longterm repurchase transactions or interest rate swaps and offbalance sheet exposures such as recourse performance bonds or credit card arrangements are subject to collateral requirements as their fair value increases the collateral requirements may increase thereby reducing the balance of unpledged securities the importance of the puerto rico market for the corporation is an additional risk factor that could affect its financing activities in the case of a deterioration in economic and fiscal conditions in puerto rico the credit quality of the corporation could be affected and result in higher credit costs refer to the geographic and government risk section of this mda for some highlights on the current status of the puerto rico economy and the ongoing fiscal crisis factors that the corporation does not control such as the economic outlook and credit ratings of its principal markets and regulatory changes could also affect its ability to obtain funding in order to prepare for the possibility of such scenario management has adopted contingency plans for raising financing under stress scenarios when important sources of funds that are usually fully available are temporarily unavailable these plans call for using alternate funding mechanisms such as the pledging of certain asset classes and accessing secured credit lines and loan facilities put in place with the fhlb and the frb the corporation is subject to positive tangible capital requirements to utilize secured loan facilities with the fhlb that could result in a limitation of borrowing amounts or maturity terms even if the corporation exceeds wellcapitalized regulatory capital levels the credit ratings of populars debt obligations are a relevant factor for liquidity because they impact the corporations ability to borrow in the capital markets its cost and access to funding sources credit ratings are based on the financial strength credit quality and concentrations in the loan portfolio the level and volatility of earnings capital adequacy the quality of management geographic concentration in puerto rico the liquidity of the balance sheet the availability of a significant base of core retail and commercial deposits and the corporations ability to access a broad array of wholesale funding sources among other factors furthermore various statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends an insured depository institution may pay to its holding company without regulatory approval a member bank must obtain the approval of the federal reserve board for any dividend if the total of all dividends declared by the member bank during the calendar year would exceed the total of its net income for that year combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years after considering those years dividend activity less any required transfers to surplus or to a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock during the nine months ended september bppr declared cash dividends of million at september bppr would have needed to obtain prior approval of the federal reserve board before declaring a dividend due to its declared dividend activity and transfers to statutory reserves over the latest three years in addition a member bank may not declare or pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits as reported in its report of condition and income unless the member bank has received the approval of the federal reserve board a member bank also may not permit any portion of its permanent capital to be withdrawn unless the withdrawal has been approved by the federal reserve board pursuant to these requirements pb may not declare or pay a dividend without the prior approval of the federal reserve board and the nysdfs the ability of a bank subsidiary to upstream dividends to its bhc could thus be impacted by its financial performance and capital including tangible and regulatory capital thus potentially limiting the amount of cash moving up to the bhcs from the banking subsidiaries this could in turn affect the bhcs ability to declare dividends on its outstanding common and preferred stock repurchase its securities or meet its debt obligations for example the corporations banking subsidiaries have historically not used unsecured capital market borrowings to finance its operations and therefore are less sensitive to the level and changes in the corporations overall credit ratings obligations subject to rating triggers or collateral requirements the corporations banking subsidiaries currently do not use borrowings that are rated by the major rating agencies as these banking subsidiaries are funded primarily with deposits and secured borrowings the banking subsidiaries had million in deposits at september that are subject to rating triggers in addition certain mortgage servicing and custodial agreements that bppr has with third parties include rating covenants in the event of a credit rating downgrade the third parties have the right to require the institution to engage a substitute cash custodian for escrow deposits andor increase collateral levels securing the recourse obligations also as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements the corporation services residential mortgage loans subject to credit recourse provisions certain contractual agreements require the corporation to post collateral to secure such recourse obligations if the institutions required credit ratings are not maintained collateral pledged by the corporation to secure recourse obligations amounted to approximately million at september the corporation could be required to post additional collateral under the agreements management expects that it would be able to meet additional collateral requirements if and when needed the requirements to post collateral under certain agreements or the loss of escrow deposits could reduce the corporations liquidity resources and impact its operating results credit risk geographic and government risk the corporation is exposed to geographic and government risk the corporations assets and revenue composition by geographical area and by business segment reporting are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements commonwealth of puerto rico a significant portion of our financial activities and credit exposure is concentrated in the commonwealth of puerto rico the commonwealth or puerto rico which faces severe economic and fiscal challenges hurricane fiona on september hurricane fiona made landfall in the southwest area of puerto rico as a category hurricane bringing record rainfall and flooding throughout the island and affecting communities where bppr does business the hurricane caused a complete blackout on the island and considerable damage to certain sectors in the southwest region while the impact to bpprs operations was not material customers in certain municipalities of the island were impacted by the disaster as part of hurricane relief efforts the corporation waived latepayment fees on individual lending products from september through october the corporation also offered to clients impacted by the hurricane a moratorium of up to three monthly payments until december on personal and commercial credit cards auto loans leases and personal loans subject to certain eligibility requirements various payment relief alternatives were also made available to certain mortgage customers depending on their type of loan the corporation is still evaluating the impact of hurricane fiona however given the low level of assistance requests received by the corporation to date the effect on credit risk should not be significant economic performance the commonwealths economy entered a recession in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and its gross national product gnp contracted in real terms every fiscal year between and with the exception of fiscal year pursuant to the latest puerto rico planning board the planning board estimates dated march the commonwealths real gnp increased by in fiscal year due to the influx of federal funds and private insurance payments to repair damage caused by hurricanes irma and maría however the planning board estimates that the commonwealths real gnp decreased by approximately in fiscal year due primarily to the adverse impact of the covid19 pandemic and the measures taken by the government in response to the same the planning board projected that the negative effects of covid19 would continue through fiscal year resulting in a contraction in real gnp of approximately followed by and gnp growth in fiscal years and respectively certain information regarding current economic activity is available in the form of the economic development bank for puerto rico edb economic activity index the edb economic activity index a coincident indicator of ongoing economic activity but not a direct measurement of real gnp the latest edb economic activity index reflected a increase in august compared to august from january to august the edb economic activity index reflected a increase compared to the same period in calendar year the puerto rico consumer price index published by the department of labor and human resources of puerto rico was recorded at in september representing a increase when compared to september and effectively flat versus august the united states consumer price index published by the us bureau of labor statistics increased by from september and by from august increasing inflation or prolonged periods of high inflation may adversely affect our business and results of operations fiscal challenges the commonwealths central government and many of its instrumentalities public corporations and municipalities continue to face significant fiscal challenges which have been primarily the result of economic contraction persistent and significant budget deficits a high debt burden unfunded legacy obligations and lack of access to the capital markets among other factors the escalating fiscal and economic crisis and imminent widespread defaults prompted the us congress to enact the puerto rico oversight management and economic stability act promesa in june as further discussed below under pending title iii proceedings the commonwealth and several of its instrumentalities recently emerged from a bankruptcylike process under promesa promesa promesa among other things created a sevenmember federallyappointed oversight board the oversight board with ample powers over the fiscal and economic affairs of the commonwealth its public corporations instrumentalities and municipalities and established two mechanisms for the restructuring of the obligations of such entities pursuant to promesa the oversight board will remain in place until market access is restored and balanced budgets in accordance with modified accrual accounting are produced for at least four consecutive years in october the oversight board designated the commonwealth and all of its public corporations and instrumentalities except its municipalities as covered entities under promesa in may the oversight board also designated all of the commonwealths municipalities as covered entities at the oversight boards request covered entities are required to submit fiscal plans and annual budgets to the oversight board for its review and approval they are also required to seek oversight board approval to issue guarantee or modify their debts and to enter into contracts with an aggregate value of million or more finally covered entities are potentially eligible to avail themselves of the debt restructuring processes provided by promesa for additional discussion of risk factors related to the puerto rico fiscal challenges see part i item risk factors in the corporations form 10k fiscal plans commonwealth fiscal plan the oversight board has certified several fiscal plans for the commonwealth since the most recent fiscal plan for the commonwealth certified by the oversight board is dated january the fiscal plan pursuant to the fiscal plan while the covid19 pandemic and the measures taken in response to the same severely reduced economic activity and caused an unprecedented increase in unemployment in puerto rico pandemicrelated federal and local stimulus funding have more than offset the estimated income loss due to reduced economic activity and are estimated to have caused a temporary increase in personal income on a net basis the fiscal plans economic projections incorporate adjustments for these shortterm income effects for example the fiscal plan estimates that for fiscal years and real gnp will grow and respectively but projects that growth adjusted for income effects for such years will be approximately and respectively the fiscal plan incorporates the debt service costs of the commonwealths restructured debt pursuant to the plan of adjustment as defined and further explained below and projects an unrestricted surplus after debt service averaging billion annually between fiscal years to this surplus is projected to decline over time as federal disaster relief funding slows nominal gnp growth declines revenues decline and healthcare expenditures rise the fiscal plan estimates that fiscal measures could drive approximately billion in savings and extra revenue over fiscal years through and that structural reforms could drive a cumulative increase in growth by fiscal year equal to approximately billion the fiscal plan provides for the gradual reduction and the ultimate elimination by fiscal year of commonwealth budgetary subsidies to municipalities which constitute a material portion of the operating revenues of some municipalities according to the fiscal plan municipalities have made little or no progress towards implementing the fiscal discipline required to reduce reliance on commonwealth appropriations and this lack of fiscal management may threaten the ability of certain municipalities to provide necessary services such as health sanitation public safety and emergency services to their residents forcing them to prioritize expenditures other fiscal plans pursuant to promesa the oversight board has also requested and certified fiscal plans for several public corporations and instrumentalities the certified fiscal plan for the puerto rico electric power authority prepa puerto ricos electric power utility contemplated the transformation of puerto ricos electric system through among other things the establishment of a publicprivate partnership with respect to prepas transmission and distribution system the td system and calls for significant structural reforms at prepa the procurement process for the establishment of a publicprivate partnership with respect to the td system was completed in june the selected proponent luma energy llc luma and prepa entered into a 15year agreement whereby since june luma is responsible for operating maintaining and modernizing the td system the td agreement the commencement of such 15year term however was conditioned on prepas emergence from its debt restructuring process under title iii of promesa the title iii exit which has not occurred during this interim period luma has been operating the td system pursuant to a supplemental terms agreement the supplemental agreement which expires on november unless the title iii exit condition is waived or the term of the supplemental agreement is extended by the parties such termination would trigger the commencement of a transition period during which luma would transfer the operations of the td system to prepa or a thirdparty successor operator on may the oversight board certified the latest version of the fiscal plan the crim fiscal plan for the municipal revenue collection center crim the government entity responsible for collecting property taxes and distributing them among the municipalities the crim fiscal plan outlines a series of measures centered around improving the competitiveness of puerto ricos property tax regime and the enhancement of property tax collections including identifying and appraising new properties as well as improvements to existing properties and implementing operational and technological initiatives title iii proceedings on may the oversight board on behalf of the commonwealth filed a petition in the us district court to restructure the commonwealths liabilities under title iii of promesa the oversight board subsequently filed analogous petitions with respect to the puerto rico sales tax financing corporation cofina the employees retirement system of the government of the commonwealth of puerto rico ers the puerto rico highways and transportation authority hta prepa and the puerto rico public buildings authority pba on february the government completed a restructuring of cofinas debts pursuant to a plan of adjustment confirmed by the us district court on november the oversight board filed the eighth amended title iii joint plan of adjustment for the commonwealth ers and pba the commonwealth plan of adjustment on march the plan of adjustment became effective the commonwealth plan of adjustment reduced the commonwealths debt obligations from approximately billion of prepetition debt to approximately billion in new general obligation bonds and approximately billion in new contingent value instruments this also resulted in a reduction of the commonwealths maximum annual debt service by approximately on october the us district court confirmed the modified fifth amended title iii plan of adjustment for hta which is expected to become effective this year upon the satisfaction of certain conditions to its effectiveness prepas debt restructuring process under title iii of promesa is still ongoing exposure of the corporation the credit quality of bpprs loan portfolio reflects among other things the general economic conditions in puerto rico and other adverse conditions affecting puerto rico consumers and businesses while promesa provided a process to address the commonwealths fiscal challenges the adjustment measures required by the fiscal plans still present significant economic risks furthermore if global or local economic conditions worsen or the government of puerto rico and the oversight board are unable to adequately manage the commonwealths fiscal and economic challenges these adverse effects could continue or worsen in ways that we are not able to predict at september the corporations direct exposure to the puerto rico governments instrumentalities and municipalities totaled million of which million were outstanding compared to million at december of which million were outstanding a deterioration in the commonwealths fiscal and economic situation could adversely affect the value of our puerto rico government obligations resulting in losses to us of the amount outstanding million consists of loans and million are securities million and million respectively at december all of the corporations direct exposure outstanding at september were obligations from various puerto rico municipalities in most cases these were general obligations of a municipality to which the applicable municipality has pledged its good faith credit and unlimited taxing power or special obligations of a municipality to which the applicable municipality has pledged other revenues at september of the corporations exposure to municipal loans and securities was concentrated in the municipalities of san juan guaynabo carolina and bayamón for additional discussion of the corporations direct exposure to the puerto rico government and its instrumentalities and municipalities refer to note commitments and contingencies in addition at september the corporation had million in loans insured or securities issued by puerto rico governmental entities but for which the principal source of repayment is nongovernmental million at december these included million in residential mortgage loans insured by the puerto rico housing finance authority hfa a governmental instrumentality that has been designated as a covered entity under promesa december million these mortgage loans are secured by first mortgages on puerto rico residential properties and the hfa insurance covers losses in the event of a borrower default and upon the satisfaction of certain other conditions the corporation also had at september million in bonds issued by hfa which are secured by second mortgage loans on puerto rico residential properties and for which hfa also provides insurance to cover losses in the event of a borrower default and upon the satisfaction of certain other conditions december million in the event that the mortgage loans insured by hfa and held by the corporation directly or those serving as collateral for the hfa bonds default and the collateral is insufficient to satisfy the outstanding balance of these loans hfas ability to honor its insurance will depend among other factors on the financial condition of hfa at the time such obligations become due and payable the corporation does not consider the government guarantee when estimating the credit losses associated with this portfolio although the governor is currently authorized by local legislation to impose a temporary moratorium on the financial obligations of the hfa a moratorium on such obligations has not been imposed as of the date hereof bpprs commercial loan portfolio also includes loans to private borrowers who are service providers lessors suppliers or have other relationships with the government these borrowers could be negatively affected by the fiscal and economic measures taken by the commonwealth government similarly bpprs mortgage and consumer loan portfolios include loans to government employees and retirees which could also be negatively affected by fiscal measures such as employee layoffs or furloughs or reductions in pension benefits as of september bppr had billion in deposits from the commonwealth its instrumentalities and municipalities the rate at which public deposit balances may decline is uncertain and difficult to predict the amount and timing of any such reduction is likely to be impacted by for example the speed at which covid19 pandemic and hurricane recovery federal assistance is distributed and the financial condition liquidity and cash management practices of such entities as well as on the ability of bppr to maintain these customer relationships the corporation may also have direct exposure with regards to avoidance and other causes of action initiated by the oversight board on behalf of the commonwealth or other title iii debtors for additional information regarding such exposure refer to note of the consolidated financial statements united states virgin islands the corporation has operations in the united states virgin islands the usvi and has credit exposure to usvi government entities the usvi has been experiencing a number of fiscal and economic challenges which have been and might be further exacerbated as a result of the effects of the covid19 pandemic and which could adversely affect the ability of its public corporations and instrumentalities to service their outstanding debt obligations promesa does not apply to the usvi and as such there is currently no federal legislation permitting the restructuring of the debts of the usvi and its public corporations and instrumentalities to the extent that the fiscal condition of the usvi continues to deteriorate the us congress or the government of the usvi may enact legislation allowing for the restructuring of the financial obligations of usvi government entities or imposing a stay on creditor remedies including by making promesa applicable to the usvi at september the corporation had approximately million in direct exposure to usvi government entities december million the usvi has been experiencing a number of fiscal and economic challenges that could adversely affect the ability of its public corporations and instrumentalities to service their outstanding debt obligations british virgin islands the corporation has operations in the british virgin islands bvi which has been negatively affected by the covid19 pandemic particularly as a reduction in the tourism activity which accounts for a significant portion

and commercial clients compared to a loan portfolio of million at december us government as further detailed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements a substantial portion of the corporations investment securities represented exposure to the us government in the form of us government sponsored entities as well as agency mortgagebacked and us treasury securities in addition

pressures and geopolitical uncertainty however management continues to believe that the improvement over recent years in the risk profile of the corporations loan portfolios positions popular to operate successfully under the current environment the impact of hurricanes fiona and ian is still being evaluated but given fionas limited impact in the markets that popular does business and low

allowance for credit losses loans heldinportfolio the corporation adopted the new cecl accounting standard effective on january the allowance for credit losses acl represents managements estimate of expected credit losses through the remaining contractual life of the different loan segments impacted by expected prepayments the acl is maintained at a sufficient level to provide for estimated credit losses on collateral dependent loans as well as troubled debt restructurings separately from the remainder of the loan portfolio the corporations management evaluates the adequacy of the acl on a quarterly basis in this evaluation management considers current conditions macroeconomic economic expectations through a reasonable and supportable period historical loss experience portfolio composition by loan type and risk characteristics results of periodic credit reviews of individual loans and regulatory requirements amongst other factors the corporation must rely on estimates and exercise judgment regarding matters where the ultimate outcome is unknown such as economic developments affecting specific customers industries or markets other factors that can affect managements estimates are recalibration of statistical models used to calculate lifetime expected losses changes in underwriting standards financial accounting standards and loan impairment measurements among others changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers in economic conditions and in the condition of the various markets in which collateral may be sold may also affect the required level of the allowance for credit losses consequently the business financial condition liquidity capital and results of operations could also be affected at september the allowance for credit losses amounted to million an increase of million when compared with december the acl incorporated updated macroeconomic scenarios for puerto rico and the united states given that any one economic outlook is inherently uncertain the corporation uses multiple scenarios to estimate its acl the baseline scenario continues to be assigned the highest probability followed by the pessimistic scenario the corporation evaluates at least on an annual basis the assumptions tied to the cecl accounting framework these include the reasonable and supportable period as well as the reversion window this quarter as part of its evaluation procedures the corporation decided to extend the reversion window from year to years the extension in the reversion period results in a better representation of historical movements for key macroeconomic variables that impact the acl this change in assumptions contributed to a reduction of million in the acl the reasonable and supportable period assumptions remained unchanged the baseline scenario assumes an annualized gdp growth of and for puerto rico and united states respectively compared to for both regions in the previous quarter the improvement in prs gdp was mainly due to updated fiscal assumptions which include the potential impact of the inflation reduction act as for the us the reduction in gdp growth was driven by updated data for the second quarter of which reflected two consecutive quarters of gdp decline annualized gdp growth for pr and us is of and respectively compared to for both regions in the previous quarter the reduction in is in part due to tight monetary policy weaker job growth and persistent inflation the average unemployment rate remained largely consistent qoq forecasted at and for puerto rico and united states

respectively the acl for bppr was essentially flat decreasing by million to million at september when compared to december the acl for popular us increased by million at september when compared to
