us additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and capital position there have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed under part i item a risk factors in our form 10k except for the risks included below which supplement the risk factors described in our form 10k the coronavirus covid19 pandemic has significantly disrupted the global economy and the markets in which we operate which has adversely impacted and is likely to continue to adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operation its continued impact will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including the scope and duration of the pandemic the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on our employees customers clients counterparties and service providers as well as other market participants and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic the covid19 pandemic has significantly disrupted and negatively impacted the global economy disrupted global supply chains created significant volatility in the financial markets significantly increased unemployment levels worldwide and decreased consumer confidence and commercial activity generally including in the markets in which we do business leading to an increased risk of delinquencies defaults and foreclosures governments across the world have ordered the temporary closure of many businesses and the institution of social distancing shelter in place and other health and safety requirements in response to the pandemic the covid19 pandemic has also contributed to higher and more volatile credit loss expense and potential for increased chargeoffs ratings downgrades credit deterioration and defaults in many industries a sudden and significant reduction in the valuation of the equity fixedincome and commodity markets and the significant increase in the volatility of those markets and a decrease in the rates and yields on us treasury securities which has led to decreased net interest income in puerto rico our primary market the governor has issued several executive orders beginning on march declaring a health emergency ordering residents to shelter in place implementing a mandatory curfew and limiting business activity including the temporary closure or partial operation of businesses except for certain businesses that provide essential services including banking and financial institutions the government of the usvi and state governments in the us mainland including new york new jersey and florida where pb has branches also declared states of emergency as a result of the pandemic ordered the temporary closure of all nonessential businesses and ordered its citizens to remain sheltered in place and to observe social distancing causing a similar significant economic disruption although some of these restrictive measures have been eased in certain areas to allow for the gradual reopening of the economy many of the restrictive measures remain in place or have been reinstated and in some cases additional restrictive measures are being or may need to be implemented as a result of the resurgence in the spread of the virus the restrictions imposed by governments in response to the outbreak have caused significant disruption to economic activity and a sharp increase in unemployment in puerto rico which has been facing significant fiscal and economic challenges for over a decade as well as in the other markets in which we operate for more information refer to the geographic and government risk section of the mda in this quarterly report on form further deterioration of the puerto rico and the broader us economy would be expected to adversely affect the ability of our borrowers to comply with their financial obligations and adversely impact demand for our products and services the disruption in economic activity would be expected to further adversely affect the financial condition of government entities in puerto rico and the usvi to which we have exposure the covid19 pandemic has significantly disrupted our operations and already negatively impacted our business financial condition and operations many of bpprs and pbs branches were temporarily closed in response to the pandemic currently approximately of bpprs branches are operating and nearly all of pbs branches are operating albeit with substantial restrictions to preserve the health and safety of our employees and customers furthermore due to restrictions on nonessential business activities imposed on some of our thirdparty service providers certain of bpprs lines of business including mortgage originations were temporarily suspended from midmarch to early may to protect the health and safety of our workforce we have facilitated a significant portion of our workforce to work remotely which further exposes the corporation to heightened risks with respect to cybersecurity information security other operational incidents and its ability to maintain an effective system of internal controls any disruption to our ability to deliver financial products or services to or interact with our clients and customers could result in losses or increased operational costs regulatory fines penalties and other sanctions or harm our reputation furthermore in response to the pandemic the corporation has taken measures to ensure the continuity of our operations and the safety of our employees and customers while providing financial relief to customers through programs such as payment moratoriums suspensions of foreclosures and other collection activity as well as waivers of certain fees and service charges the puerto rico legislative assembly enacted legislation in april that required financial institutions to offer through june moratoriums on consumer financial products to clients impacted by the covid19 pandemic and recently extended relief with respect to mortgage products through august the federal government has also approved several economic stimulus measures including the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act or the cares act that seek to cushion the economic fallout of the pandemic including guaranteeing through the small business administrations paycheck protection program the ppp loans to small and medium businesses however there can be no assurance that measures taken by governmental authorities will be sufficient to offset the pandemics economic impact and our participation or lack of participation in certain of governmental programs enacted in response to the pandemic including the ppp could result in reputational harm litigation andor regulatory and other government action against the corporation furthermore moratoriums imposed by federal andor state law or provided voluntarily by the corporation may limit our ability to determine the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the financial condition of certain of our customers and the credit quality of our loan portfolio until borrowers that have benefited from such moratoriums are required to resume loan repayments such moratorium and stimulus programs have also imposed significant operational burdens on the corporation which also heighten the risk of operational incidents including undetected errors the corporations financial results for the first half of the year reflect the impact of the business disruption and relief measures described above for example the corporations revenue streams were impacted during the first and second quarters of the year as a result of reduced consumer transaction activity lower interchange income the waiver of certain late fees and service charges as well as the suspension in mortgage origination and related securitization and loan sale activities during the first half of the year the corporation also incurred additional expenses related to frontline employee bonuses the enabling of remote access for employees to work from home the expansion of employee benefits as well as the impact of specific measures to prevent the spread of the disease and efforts related to customer relief programs among other related expenses moreover a continued deterioration in the financial condition of our consumer and commercial borrowers as well as our customers and clients ability to fulfill contractual obligations as a result of the economic impact of the pandemic may cause the corporations provision for credit losses and net chargeoffs to further increase notwithstanding the incremental reserves taken by the corporation including the million recorded in the first quarter of due to the expected impact of covid19 w hile this provision was based on managements current best estimate of the impact of the pandemic there is significant uncertainty with respect to the full extent of its impact and as a result the financial impact on the corporations business financial condition liquidity results of operations and capital position may be significantly greater than that estimated by management and reflected in our financial statements as of the end of the second quarter of the extent to which the covid19 pandemic continues to impact our business results of operations and financial condition including our regulatory capital liquidity ratios and the liquidity of the bank holding company and its operating subsidiaries as well as the operations of our clients customers service providers and suppliers will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic the length of the pandemic and the efficacy of the extraordinary measures being put in place to address it are unknown even after the pandemic subsides the global economy may continue to experience a recession and we anticipate our businesses would be materially and adversely affected by a prolonged recession to the extent the pandemic adversely affects our business financial condition liquidity or results of operations it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the section entitled risk factors in our form 10k and any subsequent quarterly reports on form 10q the covid19 pandemics impact on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and capital position may affect the ability of the corporation to continue paying dividends to its shareholders or repurchase shares of the corporations common stock as well as the value of the corporations goodwill and its deferred tax assets as a bank holding company the corporation depends primarily on dividends from its banking and other operating subsidiaries to fund its cash needs as well as declare dividends to its shareholders and to repurchase shares of its common stock if as a result of the effects of the covid19 pandemic the corporations banking subsidiaries fail to generate sufficient net income to make dividend payments to the bank holding company this would be expected to have a negative impact on the corporations financial condition liquidity results of operation and capital position and affect the ability of the corporation to pay dividends to its shareholders and to repurchase shares of its common stock furthermore the impact of the covid19 pandemic may also adversely affect the corporations goodwill and the realizability of its deferred tax assets for example a further decline in the corporations stock price related to global andor regional macroeconomic conditions the continued weakness in the puerto rico economy and fiscal situation reduced future earnings estimates and the continuance of the current interest rate environment could have a material impact on the determination of the fair value of our reporting units which could in turn result in an impairment of goodwill similarly the covid19 pandemics impact on the expected profitability of our businesses may affect the realizability of our deferred tax assets in our puerto rico and us operations an impairment of goodwill or a writedown of the corporations deferred tax assets would affect the corporations financial condition and results of operation
