three major this evaluation is composed of components us mainland operations puerto rico banking operations and holding company for the evaluation of the realization of the deferred tax asset by taxing jurisdiction refer to note under the puerto rico internal revenue code the corporation and its subsidiaries are treated as separate taxable entities and are not entitled to file consolidated tax returns the code provides a dividendsreceived deduction of on dividends received from controlled subsidiaries subject to taxation in puerto rico and on dividends received from other taxable domestic corporations changes in the corporations estimates can occur due to changes in tax rates new business strategies newly enacted guidance and resolution of issues with taxing authorities regarding previously taken tax positions such changes could affect the amount of accrued taxes the corporation has made tax payments in accordance with estimated tax payments rules any remaining payment will not have any significant impact on liquidity and capital resources profitability the the valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns and future tax consequences represents managements best estimate of those future events changes in managements current estimates due to unanticipated events could have a material impact on the corporations financial condition and results of operations accounting deferred for tax law in evaluating a tax position the position the corporations estimate of the corporation establishes tax liabilities or reduces tax assets for uncertain tax positions when despite its assessment that its tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local the corporation believes it may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged the corporation determines whether it is morelikelythannot that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is than likely of being realized upon ultimate greater settlement the corporation evaluates these uncertain tax positions each quarter and adjusts the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations the corporation believes the estimates and assumptions used to support its evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable tax rate was after consideration of the effect on us federal tax of unrecognized us state tax benefits the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits including us and puerto rico that if recognized through earnings would affect the corporations approximately million at effective december and million at december refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on this subject matter the corporation anticipates a reduction in the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next months which could amount to approximately million including interest the amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease in the future for various reasons including adding amounts for current tax year positions expiration of open popular inc annual report income tax returns due to the statutes of limitation changes in managements judgment about the level of uncertainty status of examinations litigation and legislative activity and the addition or elimination of uncertain tax positions although the outcome of tax audits is uncertain the corporation believes that adequate amounts of tax interest and penalties have been provided for any adjustments that are expected to result from open years from time to time the corporation is audited by various federal state and local authorities regarding income tax matters although management believes its approach in determining the appropriate tax treatment is supportable and in accordance with the accounting standards it is possible that the final tax authority will take a tax position that is different than the tax position reflected in the corporations income tax provision and other tax reserves as each audit is conducted adjustments appropriately recorded in the consolidated financial statement in the period determined such differences could have an adverse effect on the corporations income tax provision or benefit or other tax reserves in the reporting period in which such determination is made and consequently on the corporations results of operations financial position and or cash flows for such period any are if goodwill and other intangible assets the corporations goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets having an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment intangibles with indefinite lives are evaluated for impairment at least annually and on a more frequent basis if events or circumstances indicate impairment could have taken place such events could include among others a significant adverse change in the business climate an adverse action by a regulator an unanticipated change in the competitive environment and a decision to change the operations or dispose of a reporting unit other identifiable intangible assets with a finite useful life are evaluated periodically for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable goodwill is recognized when the carrying amount of any of the reporting units exceeds its fair value up to the amount of the goodwill prior to the adoption of asu on january the goodwill impairment test consisted of a twostep process the first step of the goodwill impairment impairment test used to identify potential compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount the goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary if needed the second step consists of comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill the corporation estimates the fair value of each reporting unit value requirements consistent with a standard measurements the accounting the of generally impairment using fair popular inc annual report combination of methods including market price multiples of comparable companies and transactions as well as discounted cash flow analyses subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted under applicable accounting standards no impairment was recognized by the corporation from the annual test as of july 2020for a detailed description of the impairment evaluation performed by the annual goodwill corporation during the third quarter of refer to note at december goodwill amounted to million note to the consolidated financial statements provides the assignment of goodwill by reportable segment pension and postretirement benefit obligations the corporation provides pension and restoration benefit plans for certain employees of various subsidiaries the corporation also provides certain health care benefits for retired employees of bppr the noncontributory defined pension and benefit restoration plans the pension plans are frozen with regards to all future benefit accruals recorded amounts the estimated benefit costs and obligations of the pension plans and postretirement health care benefit plan opeb plan are impacted by the use of subjective assumptions including which can materially affect expected returns on plan assets discount rates termination rates retirement rates and health care trend rates management applies judgment in the determination of these factors which normally undergo evaluation against current industry practice and the actual experience of the corporation the corporation uses an independent actuarial firm for assistance in the determination of the pension plans and opeb plan costs and obligations detailed information on the plans and related valuation assumptions are included in note to the consolidated financial statements fair value assets at december the corporation periodically reviews its assumption for the longterm expected return on pension plans assets the pension was plans million the expected return on plan assets is determined by considering various factors including a total fund return estimate based on a weightedaverage of estimated returns for each asset class in each plan asset class returns are estimated using current and projected economic and market factors such as real rates of return inflation credit spreads equity risk premiums and excess return expectations as part of the review the corporations independent consulting actuaries performed an analysis of expected returns based on each plans expected asset allocation for the year using the willis towers watson us expected return estimator this analysis is reviewed by the corporation and used as a tool to develop expected rates of return together with other data this forecast reflects the actuarial firms view of expected long term rates of return for each significant asset class or economic indicator for example for large cap stocks for small cap stocks for international stocks for long reviews corporate bonds and for long treasury bonds at january a range of expected investment returns is developed and this range relies both on forecasts and on broadmarket historical benchmarks for expected returns correlations and volatilities for each asset class as a consequence of the corporation recent decreased its expected return on plan assets for year to and for the pension plans expected rates of return of and had been used for and and had been used for for the pension plans since the expected return assumption is on a longterm basis it is not materially impacted by the yearly fluctuations either positive or negative in the actual return on assets the expected return can be materially impacted by a change in the plans asset allocation net periodic benefit cost pension expense for the pension plans amounted to million in the total pension expense included a benefit of million for the expected return on assets pension expense is sensitive to changes in the expected return on assets for example decreasing the expected rate of return for from to would increase the projected pension expense for the banco popular de puerto rico retirement plan the corporations largest plan by approximately million if the projected benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets the corporation shall recognize a liability equal to the unfunded projected benefit obligation and vice versa if the fair value of plan assets exceeds the projected benefit obligation the corporation recognizes an asset equal to the overfunded projected benefit obligation this asset or liability may result in a taxable or deductible temporary difference and its tax effect shall be recognized as an income tax expense or benefit which shall be allocated to various components of the financial statements including other comprehensive income the determination of the fair value of pension plan obligations involves judgment and any changes in those estimates could impact the corporations consolidated statements of financial condition management believes that the fair value estimates of the pension plans assets are reasonable given the valuation methodologies used to measure the investments at fair value as described in note also the compositions of the plan assets are primarily in equity and debt securities which have readily determinable quoted market prices the corporation had recorded a liability for the underfunded pension benefit obligation of million at december the corporation uses the spot rate yield curve from the willis towers watson rate link model to discount the expected projected cash flows of the plans the equivalent single weighted average discount rate ranged from to for the pension plans and for the opeb plan to determine the benefit obligations at december a basis point decrease to each of the rates in the december willis towers watson rate link model would increase the projected expense for the banco popular de puerto rico retirement plan by approximately million the change would not affect the minimum required contribution to the pension plans the opeb plan was unfunded no assets were held by the plan at december the corporation had recorded a liability for the underfunded postretirement benefit obligation of million at december interest influence net including loan fees statement of operations analysis net interest income net
