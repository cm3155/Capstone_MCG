item risk factors we like other financial institutions face risks inherent to our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and capital position these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report the risks described in this report are not the only risks we face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known by us or that we currently deem to be immaterial or that are generally applicable to all financial institutions may also materially adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations or capital position economic and market risks weakness in the economy particularly in puerto rico where a significant portion of our business is concentrated has adversely impacted us in the past and may adversely impact us in the future we have been and will continue to be impacted by global and local economic and market conditions including weakness in the economy disruptions and volatility in the financial markets inflation monetary and fiscal policies public policy geopolitical conflicts business and consumer sentiment and unemployment a significant portion of our business is concentrated in puerto rico which accounted for approximately of our assets and of our deposits as of december and of our revenues for the year ended december as a result our financial condition and results of operations are highly dependent on the general trends of the puerto rico economy and other conditions affecting puerto rico consumers and businesses the concentration of our operations in puerto rico exposes us to greater risks than other banking companies with a wider geographic base puerto rico has faced significant economic and fiscal challenges in the past including a severe recession that began in and persisted for over a decade and an acute fiscal crisis that led the puerto rico government to file for a form of federal bankruptcy protection in puerto ricos fiscal and economic challenges have in the past adversely affected our customers resulting in higher delinquencies chargeoffs and increased losses for us while puerto ricos economy has been gradually recovering and the puerto rico government emerged from bankruptcy in puerto rico still faces economic and fiscal challenges moreover puerto rico has historically received a significant amount of federal funds through nonrecurring appropriations particularly to cover costs associated with its health insurance program and puerto ricos recent economic recovery has been partially driven by significant federal disaster relief and stimulus funding therefore the puerto rico economy is highly susceptible to changes in federal public policy towards puerto rico public policy changes that result in a reduction of federal funding for puerto rico or in delays in the receipt of such funding could significantly impact puerto ricos economy a weakening of the puerto rico economy or other adverse economic conditions affecting puerto rico consumers and businesses could result in decreased demand for our products or services deterioration in the credit quality of our customers higher delinquencies charge offs or increased losses all of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we are also exposed to risks related to the state of the local economies of the other markets in which we do business such as new york and florida and to the state of the global and us economy and financial markets global financial markets have recently experienced periods of extraordinary disruption and volatility exacerbated by geopolitical conflicts the us debtceiling situation high levels of inflation and rapid increases in interest rates inflationary pressures increased certain of our expenses including our personnel expenses and adversely affected consumer sentiment central bank responses to inflationary pressures led to higher market interest rates and in turn lower activity levels across us and global financial markets these circumstances resulted in and could continue to result in reductions in the value of our investments if these conditions persist or worsen our results of operations financial position and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected changes in interest rates and credit spreads can adversely impact our financial condition including our investment portfolio since a significant portion of our business involves borrowing and lending money and investing in financial instruments our business and financial performance are impacted by market interest rates and movements in those rates since a high percentage of our assets and liabilities are interest bearing or otherwise sensitive in value to changes in interest rates changes in interest rates in the shape of the yield curve or in spreads between different types of rates have had and could in the future have a material impact on our results of operations and the values of our assets and liabilities including our investment portfolio interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors over which we have no control and which we may not be able to anticipate adequately including general economic conditions and the monetary and tax policies of various governmental bodies particularly the federal reserve board increasing levels of inflation driven by pentup demand and supplychain disruptions caused by the covid19 pandemic and the war in ukraine led the federal market committee of the federal reserve board the fomc to execute a series of sharp benchmark interest rate increases beginning in the first quarter of while the fomc has indicated that it may conclude its interest rate hike cycle the amount and pace of any reduction in interest rates remains uncertain higher interest rates could lead to fewer originations of commercial and residential real estate loans loss of deposits a misalignment in the pricing of shortterm and longterm borrowings less liquidity in the financial markets and higher funding costs furthermore higher interest rates could negatively affect the payment performance on loans linked to variable interest rates to the extent borrowers are unable to afford higher interest payments which could result in higher delinquencies inflationary pressure arising from increases in interest rates may also affect borrowers financial condition and their ability to pay their debts when due additionally if the interest rates we pay on our deposits and other borrowings were to increase at a faster rate than the interest rates we receive on loans and other investments our net interest income and therefore our earnings could be adversely affected all of these outcomes could adversely affect our earnings liquidity and capital levels the rapid rise in interest rates in resulted in approximately billion in unrealized marktomarket losses on availableforsale securities held in our investment securities portfolio in october we transferred us treasury securities with a fair value of approximately billion par value of billion and with accumulated unrealized losses of million from our availableforsale portfolio to our heldtomaturity portfolio while the size of our unrealized marktomarket losses on availablefor sale securities had been reduced to billion as of december if interest rates were to again rise rapidly or for a prolonged period we may accumulate significant additional marktomarket losses on investment securities in our availableforsale portfolio which may adversely affect our tangible capital and impact our ability to return capital to our stockholders for a discussion of the corporations interest rate sensitivity please refer to the risk management section of the mda in this form 10k business risks negative changes in the financial condition of our clients have adversely impacted us in the past and may adversely impact us in the future a significant portion of our business involves lending money which exposes us to credit risk and risk of loss if borrowers do not repay their loans leases credit cards or other credit obligations the performance of these credit portfolios significantly affects our financial condition and results of operations we have in the past been adversely affected by negative changes in the financial condition of our clients due to weakness in the puerto rico and us economy if the current economic environment were to deteriorate more customers may have difficulty in repaying their credit obligations which may result in higher levels of credit losses and reserves for credit losses we are exposed to increased credit risks and credit losses to the extent our clients are concentrated by industry segment or type of client our credit risk and credit losses can increase to the extent our loans are concentrated in borrowers engaged in the same or similar activities or in borrowers who as a group may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by certain economic or market conditions we have significant exposure to borrowers in certain economic sectors such as residential and commercial real estate hospitality and healthcare challenging economic or market conditions that affect the industries or types of clients to which we have significant exposure could result in higher credit losses and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we also have direct lending and investment exposure to puerto rico government entities which have faced significant fiscal challenges at december our exposure to the puerto rico government consisted of million in direct lending exposure to puerto rico municipalities and million in loans insured or securities issued by puerto rico governmental entities but for which the principal source of repayment is nongovernmental we also have indirect lending exposure to the puerto rico government in the form of loans to private borrowers who are service providers lessors suppliers or have other relationships with the puerto rico government while the overall fiscal situation of the puerto rico government has improved in recent years including as result of the government and certain of its instrumentalities having restructured their debt obligations some puerto rico government entities including certain municipalities still face significant fiscal challenges a deterioration in the fiscal situation of the puerto rico government and its instrumentalities and in particular in the fiscal situation of the puerto rico municipalities to which we have direct lending exposure could result in higher credit losses and reserves for credit losses for a discussion of risks related to the corporations credit exposure to the puerto rico and usvi governments see the geographic and government risk section in the mda section of this form 10k deterioration in the values of real properties securing our commercial mortgage loan and construction portfolios have in the past resulted and may in the future result in increased credit losses and harm our results of operations as of december approximately of our loan portfolio consisted of loans secured by real estate collateral comprised of in commercial loans in residential mortgage loans and in construction loans the value of the collateral securing such loans is dependent upon economic conditions in the area in which the collateral is located weakness in the economy of some of the markets we serve has in the past resulted in significant declines in the value of the real properties securing our loan portfolio leading to increased credit losses if the value of the real estate properties securing our loan portfolio declines again in the future we may be required to increase our provisions for loan losses and allowance for loan losses any such increase could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations for more information on the credit quality of our construction commercial and mortgage portfolio see the credit risk section of the mda included in this form 10k we are exposed to credit risk from mortgage loans that have been sold or are being serviced subject to recourse arrangements popular is generally at risk for mortgage loan defaults from the time it funds a loan until the time the loan is sold or securitized into a mortgagebacked security however we have retained part of the credit risk on sales of mortgage loans through recourse arrangements and we also service certain mortgage loan portfolios with recourse at december we were exposed to credit risk with respect to billion in residential mortgage loans sold or serviced subject to credit recourse provisions consisting principally of loans associated with the fannie mae and freddie mac programs pursuant to such recourse provisions we are required to repurchase the loan or reimburse the thirdparty investor for the incurred loss in the event of a customer default the maximum potential amount of future payments that we would be required to make under the recourse arrangements in the event of nonperformance by the borrowers is equivalent to the total outstanding balance of the residential mortgage loans serviced with recourse and interest if applicable in the event of nonperformance by the borrower we have rights to the underlying collateral securing the mortgage loan during we repurchased approximately million in mortgage loans subject to credit recourse provisions as of december our liability established to cover the estimated credit loss exposure related to loans sold or serviced with credit recourse amounted to million we may suffer losses on these loans if the proceeds from a foreclosure sale of the property underlying a defaulted mortgage loan are less than the outstanding principal balance of the loan plus any uncollected interest advanced and the costs of holding and disposing of the related property defective and repurchased loans may harm our business and financial condition in connection with the sale and securitization of mortgage loans we are required to make a variety of customary representations and warranties regarding popular and the loans being sold or securitized our obligations with respect to these representations and warranties are generally outstanding for the life of the loan and they relate to among other things compliance with laws and regulations underwriting standards the accuracy of information in the loan documents and loan file and the characteristics and enforceability of the loan a loan that does not comply with the secondary markets requirements may take longer to sell impact our ability to securitize the loans or pledge the loans as collateral for borrowings or be unsalable or salable only at a significant discount moreover if any such loan is sold before we detect noncompliance we may be obligated to repurchase the loan and bear any associated loss directly or we may be obligated to indemnify the purchaser against any loss we seek to minimize repurchases and losses from defective loans by correcting flaws if possible and selling or reselling such loans however if we were to suffer significant losses from defective and repurchased loans our results of operations and financial condition could be materially impacted if we are unable to maintain or grow our deposits we may be subject to paying higher funding costs and our net interest income may decrease we rely primarily on bank deposits as a low cost and stable source of funding for our lending activities and the operation of our business therefore our funding costs are largely dependent on our ability to maintain and grow our deposits as our competitors have raised the interest rates they pay on deposits our funding costs have increased as we have needed to increase the rates we pay to our depositors to avoid losing deposits and to procure new ones rising interest rates have also led customers to move their funds to alternative investments that pay higher interest rates additionally periods of market stress or lack of market or customer confidence in financial institutions may result in a loss of customer deposits especially to the extent those deposits are in excess of the fdicinsured limit of as of december we had billion of deposits other than collateralized public funds which represent public deposit balances from governmental entities in the us and its territories including puerto rico and the united states virgin islands that are collateralized based on such jurisdictions applicable collateral requirements in excess of the fdicinsured limit as deposits decrease we may need to rely on more expensive sources of funding furthermore we have a significant amount of deposits from the puerto rico government its instrumentalities and municipalities billion or approximately of our total deposits as of december and the amount of these deposits may fluctuate depending on the financial condition and liquidity of these entities as well as on our ability to maintain these customer relationships under the terms of bpprs deposit pricing agreement with puerto rico public sector public fund deposit rates are market linked with a lag minus a specified spread therefore as market rates rise we are required to sequentially increase the rates we pay our public deposits if we are unable to maintain or grow our deposits for any reason we may be subject to paying higher funding costs and our net interest income may decrease operational risks we and our thirdparty providers have been and expect in the future to continue to be subject to cyberattacks which could cause substantial harm and have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations cybersecurity risks for large financial institutions such as popular have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies such as mobile banking artificial intelligence and the ability to conduct instant financial transactions anywhere globally growing geopolitical threats such as the ongoing wars in ukraine and in the gaza strip and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists nationstates hacktivists and other parties in the ordinary course of business we rely on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our operations and to transmit and store sensitive data we employ a layered defensive approach that employs people processes and technology to manage and maintain cybersecurity controls through a variety of preventative and detective tools that monitor block and provide alerts regarding suspicious activity and identify suspected advanced persistent threats notwithstanding our defensive measures and the significant resources we devote to protect the security of our systems there is no assurance that all of our security measures will be effective at all times especially as the threats from cyberattacks are continuous and severe the risk of a security breach due to a cyberattack could increase in the future as we continue to expand our mobile banking and other internetbased product offerings the use of the cloud for system development and hosting and internal use of internetbased products and applications we continue to detect and identify attacks that are becoming more sophisticated and increasing in volume as well as attackers that respond rapidly to changes in defensive countermeasures the most significant cyberattack risks that we or our critical service providers may face include but are not limited to efraud denialofservice ddos ransomware computer intrusion and the exploitation of software zeroday vulnerabilities that might result in disruption of services and in the exposure or loss of customer or proprietary data loss from efraud occurs when cybercriminals compromise our systems or the systems of our customers and extract funds from customers credit cards or bank accounts including through brute force password spraying and credential stuffing attacks directed at gaining unauthorized access to individual accounts denialofservice attacks intentionally disrupt the ability of legitimate users including customers and employees to access networks websites and online resources computer intrusion attempts either direct or through social engineering pretext calls supply chain compromise email text or voice messages including using brand impersonation regularly referred to as phishing vishing smishing and quishing have resulted in and may continue to result in the compromise of sensitive customer data such as account numbers credit cards and social security numbers and could present significant reputational legal and regulatory costs to popular if successful the emergence of new technologies such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing are further expected to exacerbate the risk of cyberattacks our customerfacing platforms are also routinely attacked by threat actors aiming to gain unauthorized access to our clients accounts popular has recently implemented certain defensive measures in response to brute force attacks on one of our platforms which resulted in certain of our customers login credentials and information being exposed as a result popular notified as required or otherwise deemed appropriate customers identified as affected by the incident we have to date not experienced material losses in connection with these attacks cybersecurity risks have also been recently exacerbated by the discovery of zero day vulnerabilities in widely distributed third party software such as the vulnerability identified in the apache log4j in december and in the moveit file transfer application in may which could affect populars or any of its service providers systems the increased use of remote access and thirdparty video conferencing solutions to enable workfromhome arrangements for employees and facilitate the use of digital channels by our customers has also increased our exposure to cyber attacks in addition a third party could misappropriate confidential information obtained by intercepting signals or communications from mobile devices used by populars customers or employees recent events including the wars in ukraine and the gaza strip have also illustrated increased geopolitical factors and the risks related to supplychain compromises and destabilizing activities linked to nationstate sponsored activity as an increasing trend to monitor actively risks and exposures related to cyber security attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats including the rise in the use of cyberattacks as geopolitical weapons although we are regularly targeted by unauthorized threat actor activity including denialofservice attacks we have not to date experienced any material losses as a result of cyberattacks a material compromise or circumvention of the security of our systems could have serious negative consequences for us including significant disruption of our operations and those of our clients customers and counterparties misappropriation of confidential information of us or that of our clients customers counterparties or employees or damage to computers or systems used by us or by our clients customers and counterparties and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws financial loss to us or to our customers loss of confidence in our security measures customer dissatisfaction significant litigation exposure and harm to our reputation all of which could have a material adverse effect on us for example if personal nonpublic confidential or proprietary information in our possession were to be mishandled misused or stolen we could suffer significant regulatory consequences reputational damage and financial loss such mishandling misuse or misappropriation could include for example if such information were provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information either by fault of our systems by our employees or counterparties or where such information is intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by our employees or third parties the extent of a particular cyberattack and the steps that we may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear and it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed while such an investigation is ongoing popular may not necessarily know the full extent of the harm caused by the cyberattack and that damage may continue to spread these factors may inhibit our ability to provide rapid full and reliable information about the cyberattack to our clients customers counterparties and regulators as well as the public moreover new regulations may require us to disclose information about a cybersecurity event before it has been resolved or fully investigated furthermore it may not be clear how best to contain and remediate the potential harm caused by the cyberattack and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated cyberattacks could cause interruptions in our operations and result in the incurrence of significant costs including those related to forensic analysis and legal counsel each of which may be required to ascertain the extent of any potential harm to our customers or employees or damage to our information systems and any legal or regulatory obligations that may result therefrom any cyber incidents could also result in among other things increased regulatory scrutiny and adverse regulatory or civil litigation consequences for a discussion of the guidance and rules that federal banking regulators have released or proposed regarding cybersecurity and cyber risk management standards see regulation and supervision in part i item business included in the form 10k for the year ended december any or all of the foregoing factors could further increase the impact of the incident and thereby the costs and consequences of a cyberattack we also rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology functions and the provision of information security technology and business process services as a result a successful compromise or circumvention of the security of the systems of these thirdparty service providers could have serious negative consequences for us including compromise of our systems misappropriation of our confidential information or that of our clients customers counterparties or employees or other negative implications identified above with respect to a cyberattack on our systems which could have a material adverse effect on us cyberattacks at thirdparty service providers are also becoming increasingly common and as a result cybersecurity risks relating to our vendors have increased the most important of these thirdparty service providers for us is evertec certain risks particular to evertec and our dependence on third parties are discussed under we rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure including certain of our core financial transaction processing and information technology and security services which exposes us to a number of operational risks that could have a material adverse effect on us in the operational risks section of item in this form 10k during we determined that as a result of the widely reported breach of accellion incs file transfer appliance tool which was being used at the time of such breach by a usbased thirdparty advisory services vendor of popular personal information of certain popular customers was compromised during personal information of popular customer data was compromised in a data breach incident that impacted moveit the thirdparty file transfer platform used by one of our services providers in both instances popular notified as required or otherwise deemed appropriate customers identified as affected by the incident although these incidents did not have a material effect on popular or its financial condition our networks and systems were not impacted and our thirdparty service providers agreed to cover external remediation costs associated therewith a compromise of the personal information of our customers maintained by third party vendors could result in significant regulatory consequences reputational damage and financial loss to usthe success of our business depends in part on the continuing ability of these and other third parties to perform these functions and services in a timely and satisfactory manner which performance could be disrupted or otherwise adversely affected due to failures or other information security events originating at the third parties or at the third parties suppliers or vendors socalled fourth party risk we may not be able to effectively directly monitor or mitigate fourthparty risk in particular as it relates to the use of common suppliers or vendors by the third parties that perform functions and services for us as cyber threats continue to evolve we expect to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our layers of defense or to investigate and remediate additional information security vulnerabilities or incidents system enhancements and updates also create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones including risks associated with supply chain compromises and the software development lifecycle of the systems used by us and our service providers due to the complexity and interconnectedness of information technology systems the process of enhancing our layers of defense can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues in addition addressing certain information security vulnerabilities such as hardwarebased vulnerabilities may affect the performance of our information technology systems the ability of our hardware and software providers to deliver patches and updates to mitigate vulnerabilities in a timely manner can introduce additional risks particularly when a vulnerability is being actively exploited by threat actors moreover our efforts to timely mitigate vulnerabilities and manage such risks given the rise in number and urgency of required patches and thirdparty software including zeroday vulnerabilities as well as the obsolescence in some of our hardware and software may impact our daytoday operations the availability of our systems and delay the deployment of technology enhancements and innovation the obsolescence in any of our hardware or software may limit our ability to mitigate vulnerabilities if populars operational systems or those of external parties on which populars businesses depend are unable to meet the requirements of our businesses and operations or bank regulatory standards or if they fail have other significant shortcomings or are impacted by cyberattacks popular could be materially and adversely affected unforeseen or catastrophic events including extreme weather events and other natural disasters manmade disasters acts of violence or war or the emergence of pandemics or epidemics could cause a disruption in our operations or other consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations a significant portion of our operations are located in the caribbean and florida a region susceptible to hurricanes earthquakes and other similar events in puerto rico usvi and bvi were severely impacted by hurricanes irma and maría which resulted in significant disruption to our operations and adversely affected our clients in these markets and in hurricane fiona impacted the southwest area of puerto rico adversely affecting our customers in that region other types of unforeseen or catastrophic events including pandemics epidemics manmade disasters or acts of violence or war or the fear that such events could occur could also adversely impact our operations and financial results for example in the covid19 pandemic severely impacted global health financial markets consumer spending and global economic conditions and caused significant disruption to businesses worldwide including our business and those of our customers service providers and suppliers future unforeseen or catastrophic events including new pandemic events and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to such events could again adversely affect our operations cause economic and market disruption adversely impact the ability of borrowers to timely repay their loans or affect the value of any collateral held by us any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations the frequency severity and impact of future unforeseen or catastrophic events is difficult to predict while we maintain insurance against natural disasters and other unforeseen events including coverage for business interruption the insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the damage from any such event and there is no insurance against the disruption that a catastrophic event could produce to the markets that we serve and the potential negative impact to economic activity climate change could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and that of our clients and customers our business and the activities and operations of our clients and customers may be disrupted by global climate change potential physical risks from climate change include the increase in the frequency and severity of weather events such as storms and hurricanes and longterm shifts in climate patterns such as sustained higher and lower temperatures sea level rise heat waves and droughts among others our geographic concentration in localities including puerto rico the usvi bvi and florida particularly susceptible to risks arising from climate change including severe hurricanes and sea level rise heighten the threat we face from climate change additionally the impact of climate change in the markets that we operate and in other global markets may have the effect of increasing the costs or reducing the availability of insurance needed for our business operations climate change may also create transitional risks resulting from a shift to a lowcarbon economy these transition risks may include changes in the legal and regulatory landscape technology consumer sentiment and preferences and market demands that seek to mitigate the effects of climate change changes in the legal and regulatory landscape may additionally increase our compliance costs these climatedriven changes could have a material adverse impact on asset values and on our business and financial performance and those of our clients and customers we rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure including certain of our core financial transaction processing and information technology and security services which exposes us to a number of operational risks that could have a material adverse effect on us third parties provide key components of our business operations such as data processing information security recording and monitoring transactions online banking interfaces and services internet connections and network access the most important of these thirdparty service providers for us is evertec although the evertec business acquisition transaction narrowed the scope of services which we are dependent on evertec to obtain and released us from exclusivity restrictions that limited our ability to engage other thirdparty providers of financial technology services we are still dependent on evertec for the provision of essential services to our business including certain of our core financial transaction processing and information technology and security services as a result we are particularly exposed to the operational risks of evertec including those relating to a breakdown or failure of evertecs systems or internal controls environment over the course of our relationship with evertec we have experienced interruptions and delays in key services provided by evertec as well as cyber events as a result of system breakdowns misconfigurations human error application obsolescence and dependency on shared infrastructure components which have in certain cases also led to exposure of bppr customer information our ability to cure legacy obsolescence in the hardware and software we procure from evertec as well as to effect the segregation of our shared infrastructure is expected to be lengthy and complex which exacerbates our exposure to resulting operational including cybersecurity risks see the transition to new financial services technology providers and the replacement of services currently provided to us by evertec will be lengthy and complex in the operational risks section of item in this form 10k below while we select thirdparty vendors carefully and have increased our oversight of these relationships we do not control the actions of our vendors any problems caused by these vendors including those resulting from disruptions in the services provided vulnerabilities in or breaches of the vendors systems failure of the vendor to handle current or higher volumes failure of the vendor to provide services for any reason or poor performance of services or failure of the vendor to notify us of a reportable event in a timely manner could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business result in potential liability to clients and customers result in the imposition of fines penalties or judgments by our regulators lead to exposure of bppr customer information or harm to our reputation any of which could materially and adversely affect us the inability of our thirdparty service providers to timely address evolving cybersecurity threats may further exacerbate these risks financial or operational difficulties of a thirdparty vendor could also hurt our operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendors ability to serve us replacing these thirdparty vendors when possible could also create significant delay and expense accordingly the use of third parties creates an unavoidable inherent risk to our business operations the transition to new financial services technology providers and the replacement of services currently provided to us by evertec will be lengthy and complex switching from one vendor of core bank processing and related technology and security services to one or more new vendors is a complex process that carries business and financial risks the implementation cycle for such a transition can be lengthy and require significant financial and management resources from us such a transition can also expose us and our clients to increased costs including conversion costs business disruption as well as operational and cybersecurity risks upon the transition of all or a portion of existing services provided by evertec to a new financial services technology provider either i at the end of the term of the second amended and restated master services agreement the msa and related agreements or ii earlier upon the termination of any service for convenience under the msa these transition risks could result in an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations although evertec has agreed to provide certain transition assistance to us in connection with the termination of the msa we are ultimately dependent on their ability to provide those services in a responsive and competent manner furthermore we may require transition assistance from evertec beyond the term of the msa delaying and lengthening any transition process away from evertec while increasing related costs under the msa we are able to terminate services for convenience with days prior notice we expect to exercise during the term of the msa the right to terminate certain services for convenience and to transition such services to other service providers prior to the expiration of the msa subject to complying with the revenue minimums contemplated in the msa and certain other conditions in practice in order to switch to a new provider for a particular service we will have to commence procuring and working on a transition process for such service significantly in advance of its termination and in any case much earlier than the automatic renewal notice date or the expiration date of the msa and such process may extend beyond the current term of the msa furthermore if we are unsuccessful or decide not to complete the transition after expending significant funds and management resources it could also result in an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations legal and regulatory risks our businesses are highly regulated and the laws and regulations that apply to us have a significant impact on our business and operations we are subject to extensive and evolving regulation under us federal state and puerto rico laws that govern almost all aspects of our operations and limit the businesses in which we may be engaged including regulation supervision and examination by federal state and foreign banking authorities these laws and regulations have expanded significantly over an extended period of time and are primarily intended for the protection of consumers borrowers and depositors compliance with these laws and regulations has resulted and will continue to result in significant costs additional laws and regulations may be enacted or adopted in the future that could significantly affect our powers authority and operations and which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in particular we could be adversely impacted by changes in laws and regulations or changes in the application interpretation or enforcement of laws and regulations that proscribe or institute more stringent restrictions on certain financial services activities or impose new requirements relating to the impact of business activities on esg concerns the management of risks associated with those concerns and the offering of products intended to achieve esgrelated objectives in addition new laws or regulations could require significant system and process changes that require systems upgrades and could limit our ability to meet adoption timeframes or pursue our innovation roadmap if we do not appropriately comply with current or future laws or regulations we may be subject to fines penalties or judgements or to material regulatory restrictions on our business which could also materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the federal banking regulators proposed revisions to the us capital rules and new longterm debt requirements for banking organizations with billion or more in assets if finalized as proposed the revisions to the capital rules and the new longterm debt requirements are expected to generally increase capital requirements and expenses including interest and noninterest expense for large banking organizations in addition during the federal banking regulators indicated that they are considering revisions to liquidity requirements applicable to banking organizations with billion or more in light of the failures of three large banks in march and may any such revisions could require large banks to change the size and composition of their liquidity portfolios which could have adverse effects on net interest income and net interest margin the pending and anticipated proposals reflect a trend of increasingly stringent regulatory requirements for banking organizations with assets of billion or more relative to smaller banking organizations as well as less differentiation in the requirements applicable among banking organizations with billion or more in assets although popular currently has less than billion in assets actual anticipated or potential changes in regulatory requirements for banking organizations with at least billion in assets could result in popular deciding not to pursue growth opportunities that would result in its assets approaching or exceeding that threshold or if populars assets do exceed that threshold a need for popular to increase its regulatory capital issue substantial amounts of longterm debt or incur other significant expenses in order to satisfy applicable regulatory requirements our participation or lack of participation in certain governmental programs such as the paycheck protection program ppp enacted in response to the covid19 pandemic also exposes us to increased legal and regulatory risks we have also been and could continue to be exposed to adverse action for the violation of applicable legal requirements or the improper conduct of our employees in connection with such loans for example on january popular bank consented to the imposition of an order from the federal reserve board requiring it to pay a million civil money penalty to settle certain findings arising from popular banks approval of six payment protection program loans we are from time to time subject to information requests investigations and other regulatory enforcement proceedings from departments and agencies of the us and puerto rico governments including those that investigate compliance with us sanctions and consumer protection laws and regulations which may expose us to significant penalties and collateral consequences and could result in higher compliance costs or restrictions on our operations we from timetotime selfreport compliance matters to or receive requests for information from departments and agencies of the us and puerto rico governments including with respect to compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations for example bppr has in the past received requests for information such as subpoenas and civil investigative demands from us government regulators including concerning addons on consumer products real estate appraisals and residential and construction loans in puerto rico bppr has also selfidentified and reported to applicable regulators compliance matters related to us sanctions as well as mortgage credit reporting and other consumer lending practices incidents of this nature and investigations or examinations by governmental authorities have resulted in the past and may in the future result in judgments settlements fines enforcement actions penalties or other sanctions adverse to the corporation which could materially and adversely affect the corporations business financial condition or results of operations or cause serious reputational harm any such settlements or orders that we enter into or that regulatory authorities impose on us could require enhancements to our procedures and controls and entail significant operational and compliance costs furthermore issues or delays in satisfying the requirements of a regulatory settlement or action on a timely basis could result in additional penalties and enforcement actions which could be significant in connection with the resolution of regulatory proceedings enforcement authorities may seek admissions of wrongdoing and in some cases criminal pleas which could lead to increased exposure to private litigation loss of clients or customers and restrictions on offering certain products or services in addition responding to informationgathering requests investigations and other regulatory proceedings regardless of the ultimate outcome of the matter could be time consuming expensive and divert management attention from our business financial services institutions such as popular have been subject to heightened expectations and regulatory scrutiny in recent years our regulators oversight is not limited to banking and financial services laws but extends to other significant laws such as those related to anti money laundering antibribery and anticorruption laws further regulators in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties have significant discretion and power to prevent or remedy what they deem to be unsafe and unsound practices or violations of laws by banks and bank holding companies therefore the outcome of any investigative or enforcement action which may take years and be material to popular may be difficult to predict or estimate complying with economic and trade sanctions programs and antimoney laundering laws and regulations can increase our operational and compliance costs and risks if we and our subsidiaries affiliates or thirdparty service providers are found to have failed to comply with applicable economic and trade sanctions programs and antimoney laundering laws and regulations we could be exposed to fines sanctions and penalties and other regulatory actions as well as governmental investigations as a federally regulated financial institution we must comply with regulations and economic and trade sanctions and embargo programs administered by the office of foreign assets control ofac of the us treasury as well as antimoney laundering laws and regulations including those under the bank secrecy act economic and trade sanctions regulations and programs administered by ofac prohibit usbased entities from entering into or facilitating unlicensed transactions with for the benefit of or in some cases involving the property and property interests of persons governments or countries designated by the us government under one or more sanctions regimes and also prohibit transactions that provide a benefit that is received in a country designated under one or more sanctions regimes we are also subject to a variety of reporting and other requirements under the bank secrecy act including the requirement to file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports that are designed to assist in the detection and prevention of money laundering terrorist financing and other criminal activities in addition as a financial institution we are required to among other things identify our customers adopt formal and comprehensive antimoney laundering programs scrutinize or altogether prohibit certain transactions of special concern and be prepared to respond to inquiries from us law enforcement agencies concerning our customers and their transactions failure by the corporation its subsidiaries affiliates or thirdparty service providers to comply with these laws and regulations could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the corporation including the possibility of regulatory enforcement or other legal action including significant civil and criminal penalties we also incur higher costs and face greater compliance risks in structuring and operating our businesses to comply with these requirements the markets in which we operate heighten these costs and risks we have established riskbased policies and procedures and employed software designed to assist us and our personnel in complying with these applicable laws and regulations even if the appropriate controls are in place there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will prevent us from blocking and rejecting all applicable transactions of our customers or our customers customers that may involve a sanctioned person government or country any failure to detect and prevent any such transaction could result in a violation of applicable laws and regulations and adversely affect our reputation business financial condition and results of operations from time to time we have identified and voluntarily selfdisclosed to ofac transactions that were not timely identified blocked or rejected by our policies controls and procedures for screening transactions that might violate the regulations and economic and trade sanctions programs administered by ofac for example during the second quarter of bppr entered into a settlement agreement with ofac with respect to certain transactions processed on behalf of two employees of the government of venezuela in apparent violation of us sanctions against venezuela popular agreed to pay approximately to settle the apparent violations which had been selfdisclosed to ofac there can be no assurances that any failure to comply with us sanctions and embargoes or with antimoney laundering laws and regulations will not result in material fines sanctions or other penalties being imposed on us furthermore if the policies controls and procedures of one of the corporations thirdparty service providers together with our thirdparty oversight of such providers do not prevent it from violating applicable laws and regulations in transactions in which it engages such violations could adversely affect its ability to provide services to us we are subject to regulatory capital adequacy requirements and if we fail to meet these requirements our business and financial condition will be adversely affected under regulatory capital adequacy requirements and other regulatory requirements popular and our banking subsidiaries must meet requirements that include quantitative measures of assets liabilities and certain offbalance sheet items subject to qualitative judgments by regulators regarding components risk weightings and other factors if we fail to meet these minimum capital requirements and other regulatory requirements our business and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected if a financial holding company fails to maintain wellcapitalized status under the regulatory framework or is deemed not well managed under regulatory exam procedures or if it experiences certain regulatory violations its status as a financial holding company and its related eligibility for a streamlined review process for acquisition proposals and its ability to offer certain financial products may be compromised and its financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected the failure of any depository institution subsidiary of a financial holding company to maintain wellcapitalized or wellmanaged status could have similar consequences in addition federal regulators have proposed revisions to increase capital requirements for banking organizations with billion or more in assets if adopted such standards may in the future affect us see our businesses are highly regulated and the laws and regulations that apply to us have a significant impact on our business and operations in the legal and regulatory risks section of item in this form 10k increases in fdic insurance premiums may have a material adverse effect on our earnings substantially all the deposits of bppr and pb are subject to insurance up to applicable limits by the fdics deposit insurance fund dif and as a result bppr and pb are subject to fdic deposit insurance assessments on october the fdic finalized a rule that increased initial base deposit insurance assessment rates by basis points beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of in addition in november the fdic finalized a rule that imposes a special assessment to recover the costs to the dif resulting from the fdics use in march of the systemic risk exception to the leastcost resolution test under the fdia in connection with the receiverships of silicon valley bank and signature bank the exact amount of this assessment will be determined when the fdic terminates the related receiverships considered in the final rule accordingly the final special assessment amount and collection period may change as the estimated cost is periodically adjusted or if the total amount collected varies we are generally unable to control the amount of premiums or additional assessments that we are required to pay for fdic insurance if there are additional bank or financial institution failures our level of nonperforming assets increases or our risk profile changes or our capital position is impaired we may be required to pay even higher fdic premiums any future additional increases in fdic premiums assessment rates or special assessments may materially adversely affect our results of operations see the supervision and regulationfdic insurance discussion in item business of this form 10k for additional information related to the fdics deposit insurance assessments applicable to bppr and pb the resolution of pending litigation and regulatory proceedings if unfavorable could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects we face legal risks in our businesses and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remains high substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects for further information relating to our legal risk see note commitments contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k liquidity risks we are subject to liquidity risks arising from market events or disruptions and instances of low investor and depositor confidence furthermore actions by the rating agencies or decreases in our capital levels may have adverse effects on our liquidity and business including by raising the cost of our obligations or affecting our ability to borrow we must maintain adequate liquidity and funding sources to support our operations fund customer deposit withdrawals repay borrowings and debt comply with our financial obligations fund planned capital distributions and meet regulatory requirements the corporations most significant source of funds are bank deposits including customer deposits and brokered deposits in addition to deposits sources of liquidity include secured borrowing arrangements such as those with the federal reserve bank of new york and the federal home loan bank of new york fhlbny unpledged securities from our investment portfolio the capital markets and proceeds from loan sales or securitizations populars liquidity and ability to fund and operate its business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors some of which are out of populars control for example market events or disruptions such as periods of market stress and low investor confidence in financial institutions could result in deposit withdrawals especially to the extent those deposits are in excess of the fdicinsured limit of as of december we had billion of deposits other than collateralized public funds which represent public deposit balances from governmental entities in the us and its territories including puerto rico and the united states virgin islands that are collateralized based on such jurisdictions applicable collateral requirements in excess of the fdicinsured limit we may also suffer outflows of customer deposits due to competition from other banks or alternative investments in addition in periods of stress we may not be able to access existing funding sources access the capital markets or to sell or securitize loans or other assets or to access such sources or to sell or securitize assets on favorable terms in addition actions by the rating agencies could raise the cost of our borrowings since lower rated securities are usually required by the market to pay higher rates than obligations of higher credit quality our credit ratings were reduced substantially in and although one of the three major rating agencies upgraded our senior unsecured rating back to investment grade during the remaining two rating agencies have not upgraded their current noninvestment grade rating the market for non investment grade securities is much smaller and less liquid than for investment grade securities if we were to attempt to issue preferred stock or debt securities into the capital markets it is possible that there would not be sufficient demand to complete a transaction or that the cost could be substantially higher than for more highly rated securities if popular is unable to access the capital markets on favorable terms our liquidity may be adversely affected changes in our ratings and capital levels could affect our relationships with some creditors and limit our access to funding for example having negative tangible capital may impact our ability to access some sources of wholesale funding the federal housing finance agency restricts the fhlbny from lending to members of the fhlbny with negative tangible capital unless the members primary banking regulator makes a written request to the fhlbny to maintain access to borrowings both bppr and pb have secured borrowing facilities with the fhlbny and had outstanding exposures of billion and billion respectively as of december losing access to the fhlbny borrowing facilities could adversely impact liquidity at the banking subsidiaries additionally if bppr or pb cease to be wellcapitalized the fdia and regulations adopted thereunder would restrict their ability to accept brokered deposits and limit the rate of interest payable on deposits our banking subsidiaries also have recourse obligations under certain agreements with third parties including servicing and custodial agreements that include ratings covenants upon failure to maintain the required credit ratings the third parties could have the right to require us to engage a substitute fund custodian and increase collateral levels securing recourse obligations collateral pledged by us to secure recourse obligations approximated million on december while management expects that we would be able to meet any additional collateral requirements if and when needed the requirements to post collateral under certain agreements or the loss of custodian funds could reduce our liquidity resources and impact our results of operations as a holding company we depend on dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries for liquidity as a bank holding company we depend primarily on dividends from our banking and other operating subsidiaries to fund our cash needs including to capitalize our subsidiaries our banking subsidiaries bppr and pb are limited by law in their ability to make dividend payments and other distributions to us based on their earnings dividend history and capital position based on its current financial condition pb may not declare or pay a dividend without the prior approval of the federal reserve board and the nysdfs a failure by our banking subsidiaries to generate sufficient income and free cash flow to make dividend payments to us may affect our ability to fund our cash needs which could have a negative impact on our financial condition liquidity results of operation or capital position such failure could also affect our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders and to repurchase shares of our common stock we have in the past suspended dividend payments on our common stock and preferred stock during times of economic uncertainty and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to declare dividends to our stockholders in any future periods an impact on the tangible capital levels of our operating subsidiaries could also limit the amount of capital we may upstream to the holding company tangible capital levels have in the past been and may in the future be adversely affected by the impact of rapidly rising interest rates on investment securities in our availableforsale portfolio for a discussion of risks related to changes in interest rates see changes in interest rates and credit spreads can adversely impact our financial condition including our investment portfolio since a significant portion of our business involves borrowing and lending money and investing in financial instruments in item of this form 10k we also depend on dividends from our banking and other operating subsidiaries to pay debt service on outstanding debt and to repay maturing debt our ability to declare such dividends would be subject to regulatory requirements and could require the prior approval of the federal reserve board strategic risks potential acquisitions of businesses or loan portfolios could increase some of the risks that we face and may be delayed or prohibited due to regulatory constraints to the extent permitted by our applicable regulators we may pursue strategic acquisition opportunities acquiring other businesses however involves various risks including potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company potential disruption to our business the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company and difficulty in estimating the value of the target company if we pay a premium over book or market value in connection with an acquisition some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction furthermore failure to realize the expected revenue increases cost savings increases in geographic or product presence or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations similarly acquiring loan portfolios involves various risks when acquiring loan portfolios management makes assumptions and judgments about the collectability of the loans including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of secured loans in estimating the extent of the losses we analyze the loan portfolio based on historical loss experience volume and classification of loans volume and trends in delinquencies and nonaccruals local economic conditions and other pertinent information if our assumptions are incorrect however our actual losses could be higher than estimated and increased loss reserves may be required which would negatively affect our results of operations finally certain acquisitions by financial institutions including us are subject to approval by a variety of federal and state regulatory agencies regulatory approvals could be delayed impeded restrictively conditioned or denied we may fail to pursue evaluate or complete strategic and competitively significant acquisition opportunities as a result of our inability or perceived or anticipated inability to obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner under reasonable conditions or at all difficulties associated with potential acquisitions that may result from these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we have embarked on a broadbased multiyear technological and business process transformation the failure to achieve the goals of the transformation project the inability to maintain project expenses within current estimates or delays in executing our plans to implement the transformation project may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or cause reputational harm the corporation has embarked on a broadbased multiyear technological and business process transformation our technology and business transformation will be a significant priority for the corporation over the next two years and beyond we expect the expenses tied to this transformation project which will continue through at least to result in an enhanced digital experience for our clients as well as better technology and more efficient processes for our employees to execute the transformation project we plan to expand our digital capabilities modernize our technology foundation and implement agile and efficient business processes across the entire company we may not succeed in executing the transformation project may fail to properly estimate cost of the same or may experience delays in executing our plans which may in turn cause the corporation to incur costs exceeding our current estimates or disrupt our operations including our technological services to our customers or fall short of our projected earnings targets driven by these efforts to the extent that these disruptions persist over time andor recur this could negatively impact our competitive position require additional expenditures andor harm our relationships with our customers and thus may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or cause reputational harm we face significant and increasing competition in the rapidly evolving financial services industry we operate in a highly competitive environment in which we compete on the basis of a number of factors including customer service quality and variety of products and services price interest rates on loans and deposits innovation technology ease of use reputation and transaction execution while our main competition continues to come from other puerto rico banks and financial institutions we face increased competition from nonpuerto rico institutions as emerging technologies and the growth of ecommerce have significantly reduced geographic barriers these technologies have also made it easier for non depositary institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products and allowed nontraditional financial service providers and technology companies to provide electronic and internetbased financial solutions and services increased competition could create pressure to lower prices fees commissions or credit standards on our products and services which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations increased competition could also create pressure to raise interest rates on deposits which could also impact our financial condition and results of operations if we are unable to meet constant technological changes and react quickly to meet new industry standards including as a result of our continued dependence on evertec we may be unable to enhance our current services and introduce new products and services in a timely and costeffective manner placing us at a competitive disadvantage and significantly affecting our business financial condition and results of operations to compete effectively we need to constantly enhance and modify our products and services and introduce new products and services to attract and retain clients or to match products and services offered by our competitors including technology companies and other nonbank firms that are engaged in providing similar products and services although the evertec business acquisition transaction eliminated certain provisions of a previous master services agreement with evertec that required us to use evertec exclusively to develop and implement new or enhanced products and services and is expected to improve populars ability to manage and control the development of the customer channels supported by the assets acquired as part of the evertec business acquisition transaction the acquired assets popular expects that it will continue to depend on evertecs technology services to operate and control current products and services and to implement future products and services making our success dependent on evertecs ability to timely complete and introduce these enhancements and new products and services in a costeffective manner our ability to enhance our customer channels is also dependent on evertec timely delivering the core application programming interfaces core apis that meet bpprs requirements which evertec has committed to develop under the msa the core apis are necessary for bppr to connect future enhancements to the acquired assets to existing evertec core applications some of our competitors rely on financial services technology and outsourcing companies that are much larger than evertec serve a greater number of clients than evertec and may have better technological capabilities and product offerings than evertec furthermore financial services technology companies typically make capital investments to develop and modify their product and service offerings to facilitate their customers compliance with the extensive and evolving regulatory and industry requirements and in most cases such costs are borne by the technology provider because of our contractual relationship with evertec and because popular is the sole customer of certain of evertecs services and products we have in the past borne the full cost of such developments and modifications and may be required to do so in the future subject to the terms of the msa moreover the terms speed scalability and functionality of certain of evertecs technology services are not competitive when compared to offerings from its competitors evertecs failure to sufficiently invest in and upscale its technology and services infrastructure to meet the rapidly changing technology demands of our industry may result in us being unable to meet customer expectations and attract or retain customers furthermore evertecs strategy and investments may also be refocused away from popular towards other strategic initiatives as a result of the evertec business acquisition transaction any such impact could in turn reduce populars revenues place us in a competitive disadvantage and significantly affect our business financial condition and results of operations while the closing of the evertec business acquisition transaction narrowed the scope of services which we are dependent on evertec to obtain and released us from exclusivity restrictions that limited our ability to engage other thirdparty providers of financial technology services it also resulted in extensions of certain existing commercial agreements with evertec and as a result have prolonged the duration of our exposure to the risks presented by evertecs technological capabilities and its failures to enhance its products and services and otherwise meet evolving demands we may also be exposed to heightened business risks in connection with our dependency on evertec with respect to bpprs merchant acquiring business which exclusivity was extended until and with respect to the ath network which commitment bppr extended until in light of the pace of technology changes and competition in the payments industry the ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to our success our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees competition for qualified candidates is intense and has increased recently as a result of a tighter labor market increased competition may lead to difficulties in attracting or retaining qualified employees which may in turn lead to significant challenges in the execution of our business strategies and have an adverse effect on the quality of the service we provide to the customers and communities we serve such challenges could adversely affect our business operations and financial condition in addition increased competition may lead to higher compensation packages and more flexible work arrangements we may also be required to hire employees outside of our market areas for certain positions that require specific expertise which could result in employment and tax compliancerelated expenses challenges and risks in addition flexible work arrangements such as remote or hybrid work models have led to other workplace challenges including fewer opportunities for facetoface interactions or to promote a cohesive corporate culture and heightened cybersecurity information security and other operational risks our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is also impacted by regulatory limitations on our compensation practices such as clawback requirements of incentive compensation which may not affect other institutions with which we compete for talent the scope and content of regulators policies on executive compensation continue to develop and are likely to continue evolving such policies and limitations on our compensation practices could adversely affect our ability to attract retain and motivate talented senior leaders in support of our longterm strategy other risks an impairment of our goodwill deferred tax assets or amortizable intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations as of december we had approximately million billion and million respectively of goodwill net deferred tax assets and amortizable intangible assets including capitalized software costs recorded on our balance sheet under gaap goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually and amortizable intangible assets are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of the goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in populars stock price related to a deterioration in global or local economic conditions declines in our market capitalization reduced future earnings estimates and interest rate changes the goodwill impairment evaluation process requires us to make estimates and assumptions with regards to the fair value of our reporting units actual values may differ significantly from these estimates such differences could result in future impairment of goodwill that would in turn negatively impact our results of operations and the reporting unit where the goodwill is recorded the determination of whether a deferred tax asset is realizable is based on weighting all available evidence the realization of deferred tax assets including carryforwards and deductible temporary differences depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income of the same character during the carryback or carryforward period the analysis considers all sources of taxable income available to realize the deferred tax asset including the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards taxable income in prior carryback years and taxplanning strategies changes in these factors may affect the realizability of our deferred tax assets in our puerto rico and us operations if our goodwill deferred tax assets or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we could experience unexpected losses if the estimates or assumptions we use in preparing our financial statements are incorrect or differ materially from actual results in preparing our financial statements pursuant to us gaap we are required to make estimates and assumptions that are often based on subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain for example we use estimates and assumptions to determine our allowance for credit losses our liability for contingent litigation losses and the fair value of certain of our assets and liabilities such as debt securities loans held for sale msrs intangible assets and deferred tax assets if such estimates or assumptions are incorrect or differ materially from actual results we could experience unexpected losses or other adverse impacts some of which could be significant for further information of other risks faced by popular please refer to the mda section of this form 10k
