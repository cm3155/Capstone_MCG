forwardlooking statements this accordingly this evaluation is composed of three major components us mainland operations puerto rico banking operations and holding company for the evaluation of the realization of the deferred tax asset by taxing jurisdiction refer to note to the consolidated financial statements under the puerto rico internal revenue code the corporation and its subsidiaries are treated as separate taxable entities and are not entitled to file consolidated tax returns the code provides a dividendsreceived deduction of on dividends received from controlled subsidiaries subject to taxation in puerto rico and on dividends received from other taxable domestic corporations changes in the corporations estimates can occur due to changes in tax rates new business strategies newly enacted guidance and resolution of issues with taxing authorities regarding previously taken tax positions such changes could affect the amount of accrued taxes the corporation has made tax payments in accordance with estimated tax payments rules any remaining payment will not have any significant impact on liquidity and capital resources the valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns and future profitability the accounting for deferred tax consequences represents managements best estimate of those future events changes in managements current estimates due to unanticipated events could have a material impact on the corporations financial condition and results of operations the corporation establishes tax liabilities or reduces tax assets for uncertain tax positions when despite its assessment that the tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law the corporation believes it may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged in evaluating a tax position the corporation determines whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position the corporations estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement the corporation evaluates these uncertain tax positions each quarter and adjusts the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations the corporation believes the estimates and assumptions used to support its evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable the amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease in the future for various reasons including adding amounts for current tax year positions expiration of open income tax returns due to the statutes of limitation changes in managements judgment about the level of uncertainty status of examinations litigation and legislative activity and the addition or elimination of uncertain tax positions although the outcome of tax audits is uncertain the corporation believes that adequate amounts of tax interest and penalties have been provided for any adjustments that are expected to result from open years from time to time the corporation is audited by various federal state and local authorities regarding income tax matters although management believes its approach in determining the appropriate tax treatment is supportable and in accordance with the accounting standards it is possible that the final tax authority will take a tax position that is different than the tax position reflected in the corporations income tax provision and other tax reserves as each audit is conducted adjustments if any are appropriately recorded in the consolidated financial statement in the period determined such differences could have an adverse effect on the corporations income tax provision or benefit or other tax reserves in the reporting period in which such determination is made and consequently on the corporations results of operations financial position and or cash flows for such period goodwill and other intangible assets the corporations goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets having an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment intangibles with indefinite lives are evaluated for impairment at least annually and on a more frequent basis if events or circumstances indicate impairment could have taken place such events could include among others a significant adverse change in the business climate an adverse action by a regulator an unanticipated change in the competitive environment and a decision to change the operations or dispose of a reporting unit other identifiable intangible assets with a finite useful life are evaluated periodically for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable goodwill impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of any of the reporting units exceeds its fair value up to the amount of the goodwill the corporation estimates the fair value of each reporting unit consistent with the requirements of the fair value measurements accounting standard generally using a combination of methods including market price multiples of comparable companies and transactions as well as discounted cash flow analyses subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted under applicable accounting standards for a detailed description of the annual goodwill impairment evaluation performed by the corporation during the third quarter of refer to note to the consolidated financial statements pension and postretirement benefit obligations the corporation provides pension and restoration benefit plans for certain employees of various subsidiaries the corporation also provides certain health care benefits for retired employees of bppr the noncontributory defined pension and benefit restoration plans the pension plans are frozen with regards to all future benefit accruals the estimated benefit costs and obligations of the pension plans and postretirement health care benefit plan opeb plan are impacted by the use of subjective assumptions which can materially affect recorded amounts including expected returns on plan assets discount rates termination rates retirement rates and health care trend rates management applies judgment in the determination of these factors which normally undergo evaluation against current industry practice and the actual experience of the corporation the corporation uses an independent actuarial firm for assistance in the determination of the pension plans and opeb plan costs and obligations detailed information on the plans and related valuation assumptions are included in note to the consolidated financial statements the corporation periodically reviews its assumption for the longterm expected return on pension plans assets the pension plans assets fair value at december was million the expected return on plan assets is determined by considering various factors including a total fund return estimate based on a weightedaverage of estimated returns for each asset class in each plan asset class returns are estimated using current and projected economic and market factors such as real rates of return inflation credit spreads equity risk premiums and excess return expectations as part of the review the corporations independent consulting actuaries performed an analysis of expected returns based on each plans expected asset allocation for the year using the willis towers watson us expected return estimator this analysis is reviewed by the corporation and used as a tool to develop expected rates of return together with other data this forecast reflects the actuarial firms view of expected longterm rates of return for each significant asset class or economic indicator as of january for example for large cap stocks for small cap stocks for international stocks for long corporate bonds and for long treasury bonds a range of expected investment returns is developed and this range relies both on forecasts and on broadmarket historical benchmarks for expected returns correlations and volatilities for each asset class as a consequence of recent reviews the corporation updated its expected return on plan assets for year to and for the pension plans expected rates of return of and had been used for and and had been used for for the pension plans since the expected return assumption is on a longterm basis it is not materially impacted by the yearly fluctuations either positive or negative in the actual return on assets the expected return can be materially impacted by a change in the plans asset allocation net periodic benefit cost pension expense for the pension plans amounted to million in the total pension expense included a benefit of million for the expected return on assets pension expense is sensitive to changes in the expected return on assets for example decreasing the expected rate of return for from to would increase the projected pension expense for the banco popular de puerto rico retirement plan the corporations largest plan by approximately million if the projected benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets the corporation shall recognize a liability equal to the unfunded projected benefit obligation and vice versa if the fair value of plan assets exceeds the projected benefit obligation the corporation recognizes an asset equal to the overfunded projected benefit obligation this asset or liability may result in a taxable or deductible temporary difference and its tax effect shall be recognized as an income tax expense or benefit which shall be allocated to various components of the financial statements including other comprehensive income loss the determination of the fair value of pension plan obligations involves judgment and any changes in those estimates could impact the corporations consolidated statements of financial condition management believes that the fair value estimates of the pension plans assets are reasonable given the valuation methodologies used to measure the investments at fair value as described in note to the consolidated financial statements also the compositions of the plan assets are primarily in equity and debt securities which have readily determinable quoted market prices the corporation had recorded a pension asset of million at december the corporation uses the spot rate yield curve from the willis towers watson rate link model to discount the expected projected cash flows of the plans the equivalent single weighted average discount rate ranged from to for the pension plans and for the opeb plan to determine the benefit obligations at december a basis point decrease to each of the rates in the december willis towers watson rate link model would increase the projected expense for the banco popular de puerto rico retirement plan by approximately million the change would not affect the minimum required contribution to the pension plans the opeb plan was unfunded no assets were held by the plan at december the corporation had recorded a liability for the underfunded postretirement benefit obligation of million at december statement of operations analysis net interest income net interest

would be based on the exposure category of the investment the decrease in the cet1 capital ratio tier capital ratio and total capital ratio as of december compared to december was mostly due to an increase in risk weighted assets driven by the growth in the commercial and consumer loan portfolios partially offset by the annual earnings the increase in the leverage capital ratio was mainly due to the increase in capital driven by the annual earnings partially offset by a slight increase in average total assets pursuant to the adoption of cecl on january the corporation elected to use the

common share which are presented in the table that follows are nongaap measures management and many stock analysts use the tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share in conjunction with more traditional bank capital ratios to compare the capital adequacy of banking organizations with significant amounts of goodwill or other intangible assets typically stemming from the use of the purchase accounting method of accounting for mergers and acquisitions neither tangible common equity nor tangible assets or related measures should be considered in isolation or as a

which the corporation calculates its tangible common equity tangible assets and any other related measures may differ from that of other companies reporting measures with similar names the decrease in the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio during was mainly related to the decrease in the fair value of the corporations fixed rate available for sale debt securities portfolio and its impact on the unrealized loss component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss aoci given its ability due to the corporations liquidity position and its intention to reduce the impact on aoci and tangible capital of further increases in interest rates management changed its intent to hold certain securities to maturity therefore in october the corporation transferred us treasury securities

and capital levels of the corporation are constantly exposed to market interest rate and liquidity risks market risk refers to the risk of a reduction in the corporations capital due to changes in the market valuation of its assets andor liabilities most of the assets subject to market valuation risk are debt securities classified as availableforsale refer to notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the debt securities availableforsale and heldtomaturity portfolios debt securities classified as availableforsale amounted to billion as of december other assets subject to market risk include loans heldforsale which amounted to million mortgage servicing rights msrs which amounted to million and securities classified as trading which amounted to million as of december interest rate risk irr the corporations net interest income is subject to various categories of interest rate risk including repricing basis yield curve and option risks in managing interest rate risk management may alter the mix of floating and fixed rate assets and liabilities change pricing schedules adjust maturities through sales and purchases of investment securities and enter into derivative contracts among other alternatives interest rate risk management is an active process that encompasses monitoring loan and deposit flows complemented by investment and funding activities effective management of interest rate risk begins with understanding the dynamic characteristics of assets and liabilities and determining the appropriate rate risk position given line of business forecasts management objectives market expectations and policy constraints management utilizes various tools to assess irr including net interest income nii simulation modeling static gap analysis and economic value of equity eve the three methodologies complement each other and are used jointly in the evaluation of the corporations irr nii simulation modeling is prepared for a fiveyear period which in conjunction with the eve analysis provides management a better view of longterm irr net interest income simulation analysis performed by legal entity and on a consolidated basis is a tool used by the corporation in estimating the potential change in net interest income resulting from hypothetical changes in interest rates sensitivity analysis is calculated using a simulation model which incorporates actual balance sheet figures detailed by maturity and interest yields or costs management assesses interest rate risk by comparing various nii simulations under different interest rate scenarios that differ in direction of interest rate changes the degree of change and the projected shape of the yield curve for example the types of rate scenarios processed during the quarter include flat rates implied forwards and parallel and nonparallel rate shocks management also performs analyses to isolate and measure basis and prepayment risk exposures the asset and liability management group performs validation procedures on various assumptions used as part of the simulation analyses as well as validations of results on a monthly basis in addition the model and processes used to assess irr are subject to independent validations according to the guidelines established in the model governance and validation policy the corporation processes nii simulations under interest rate scenarios in which the yield curve is assumed to rise and decline by the same magnitude parallel shifts the rate scenarios considered in these market risk simulations include instantaneous parallel changes of and basis points during the succeeding twelvemonth period simulation analyses are based on many assumptions including that the balance sheet remains flat the relative levels of market interest rates across all yield curve points and indexes interest rate spreads loan prepayments and deposit elasticity thus they should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results further the estimates do not contemplate actions that management could take to respond to changes in interest rates additionally the corporation is also subject to basis risk in the repricing of its assets and liabilities including the basis related to using different rate indexes for the repricing of assets and liabilities as well as the effect of pricing lags which may be contractual or due to historical differences in the timing of management responses to changes in the rate environment by their nature these forwardlooking computations are only estimates and may be different from what may actually occur in the future the following table presents the results of the simulations at december and december assuming a static balance sheet and parallel changes over flat spot rates over a oneyear time horizon table net interest income sensitivity one year projection dollars in thousands change in interest rate basis points basis points basis points basis points december december amount change percent change amount change percent change the results of the nii simulations at december in the table above have been adjusted from those reported in the corporations form 10k to reflect the effect of changes in certain modeling assumptions in down rate scenario simulations for certain variable rate loans specifically the yield on certain variable rate loans that did not have contractual periodic floors were not repricing according to the terms of those variable rate loans in the down rate simulations although the adjustment referred to in the preceding paragraph results in the magnitude of the corporations sensitivity to decreases in interest rates becoming lower as of december the adjusted nii simulations continued to show that the corporation had a neutral to slightly liability sensitive position driven by the rapid increase in shortterm interest rates throughout as of december nii simulations show the corporation has a neutral to slightly asset sensitive position as compared to a slightly liability sensitive position as of december the primary reasons for the variation in sensitivity are changes in balance sheet composition driven by an increase in overnight fed funds shortterm us treasury bills t bills and loan portfolio on the asset side partially offset by higher puerto rico public sector deposits which are indexed to market rates and an increase in time deposits these results suggest that changes in the corporations net interest income sensitivity are driven by changes in the composition of the investment portfolio as the term bond portfolio continues to run off and get reinvested in shortterm investments such as tbills combined with the increase of approximately billion in loans held in portfolio additionally variation in liability cost primarily driven by puerto rico public sector deposits that represented billion or of deposits as of december as well as an increase of approximately billion in time deposits also impact the sensitivity profile in declining rate scenarios net interest income would slightly increase as the decline in the cost of these deposit generates a greater benefit than the changes in assets yields in rising rate scenarios populars net interest income is also impacted by its large proportion of puerto rico public sector deposit however the repricing of assets as they either reset or mature lead to an increase in net interest income the corporations loan and investment portfolios are subject to prepayment risk which results from the ability of a thirdparty to repay debt obligations prior to maturity prepayment risk also could have a significant impact on the duration of mortgagebacked securities and collateralized mortgage obligations since prepayments could shorten or lower prepayments

in the opinion of management the size and composition of the trading portfolio does not represent a significant source of market risk for the corporation derivatives derivatives may be used by the

derivative instruments that the corporation may use include among others interest rate caps indexed options and forward contracts the corporation does not use highly leveraged derivative instruments

liquidity may be pressured if for example it experiences a sudden and unexpected substantial cash outflow due deposit outflows whether due to a loss of confidence by depositors or other reasons including exogenous events such as the covid19 pandemic a downgrading of its credit rating or some other event that causes counterparties to avoid exposure to the institution factors that the corporation does not control such as the economic outlook adverse ratings of its principal markets perceptions of the financial services industry and regulatory changes could also affect its ability to obtain funding the corporation has adopted policies and limits to monitor the corporations liquidity position and that of its banking subsidiaries additionally contingency funding plans are used to model various stress events of different magnitudes and affecting different time horizons that assist management in evaluating the size of the liquidity buffers needed if those stress events occur however such models may not predict accurately how the market and customers might react to every event and are dependent on many assumptions deposits including customer deposits brokered deposits and

related to collateral posting requirements for certain activities mainly in connection with contractual commitments recourse provisions servicing advances derivatives and credit card licensing agreements the banking subsidiaries maintain sufficient funding capacity to address large increases in funding requirements such as deposit outflows the corporation has established liquidity guidelines that require the banking subsidiaries to have sufficient liquidity to cover all shortterm borrowings and a portion of deposits the corporations ability to compete successfully in the marketplace for deposits excluding brokered deposits depends on various factors including pricing service convenience and financial stability as reflected by operating results and financial condition credit ratings by nationally recognized credit rating agencies customer confidence and importantly fdic deposit insurance coverage deposits at all of the corporations banking subsidiaries are federally insured subject to fdic limits and this is expected to mitigate the potential effect of the aforementioned risks deposits are a key source of funding refer to table for a breakdown of

transactional deposit accounts noninterest bearing deposits and savings deposits core deposits exclude brokered deposits and certificates of deposit over core deposits excluding pr public funds that are fully collateralized have historically provided the corporation with a sizable source of relatively stable and lowcost funds pr public funds while linked to market interest rates provide a stable

the corporation had billion in brokered deposits at december which financed approximately of its total assets december billion and respectively in the event that any of the corporations banking subsidiaries regulatory capital ratios fall below those required by a wellcapitalized institution or are subject to capital restrictions by the regulators that banking subsidiary faces the risk of not being able to raise or maintain brokered deposits and faces limitations on the rate paid on deposits which may hinder the corporations ability to effectively compete in its retail markets and could affect its deposit raising efforts deposits from the public sector represent an important source of funds for the corporation as of december total public sector deposits were billion compared to billion at december generally these deposits require that the bank pledge high credit quality securities as collateral therefore liquidity risks arising from public sector deposit outflows are lower given that the bank receives its collateral in return this now unpledged collateral can either be financed via repurchase agreements or sold for cash however there are some timing differences between the time the deposit outflow occurs and when the bank receives its collateral additionally the corporation mainly utilizes fixedrate us treasury debt securities as collateral while these securities have limited credit risk they are subject to market value risk based on changes in the interest rate environment when interest rates increase the value of this collateral decreases and could result in the corporation having to provide additional collateral to cover the same amount of deposit liabilities this additional collateral could reduce unpledged securities otherwise available as liquidity sources to the corporation at december management believes that the banking subsidiaries had sufficient current and projected liquidity sources to meet their anticipated cash flow obligations as well as special needs and offbalance sheet commitments in the ordinary course of business and have sufficient liquidity resources to address a stress event although the banking subsidiaries have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances no assurance can be given that they would be able to replace those funds in the future if the corporations financial condition or general market conditions were to deteriorate the corporations financial flexibility will be severely constrained if the banking subsidiaries are unable to maintain access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future financing needs at acceptable interest rates the banking subsidiaries also are required to deposit cash or qualifying securities to meet margin requirements on repurchase agreements and other collateralized borrowing facilities to the extent that the value of securities previously pledged as collateral declines because of market changes the corporation will be required to deposit additional cash or securities to meet its margin requirements thereby adversely affecting its liquidity finally if management is required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to meet its future growth revenues may not increase proportionately to cover costs in this case profitability would be adversely affected the corporation monitors

million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding senior notes which were due on september additionally the corporations latest quarterly dividend was per share or approximately million per quarter the bhcs have in the past borrowed in the corporate debt market primarily to finance their nonbanking subsidiaries and refinance debt obligations these sources of funding are more costly due to the fact that two out of the three principal credit rating agencies rate the corporation below investment grade which affects the corporations cost and ability to raise funds in the capital markets factors that the corporation does not control such as the economic outlook interest rate volatility inflation disruptions in the debt market among others could also affect its ability to obtain

equity method investees risks to liquidity total lines of credit outstanding or available borrowing capacity under lines of credit are not necessarily a measure of the total credit available on a continuing basis some of these lines could be subject to collateral requirements changes to the value of the collateral standards of creditworthiness leverage ratios and other regulatory requirements among other factors derivatives such as those embedded in longterm repurchase transactions or interest rate swaps and offbalance sheet exposures such as recourse performance bonds or credit card arrangements are subject to collateral requirements as their fair value increases the collateral requirements may increase thereby reducing the balance of unpledged securities the importance of the puerto rico market for the corporation is an additional risk factor that could affect its financing activities in the case of a deterioration in economic and fiscal conditions in puerto rico the credit quality of the corporation could be affected and result in higher credit costs refer to the geographic and government risk section of this mda for some highlights on the current status of the puerto rico economy and the ongoing fiscal crisis factors that the corporation does not control such as the economic outlook and credit ratings of its principal markets and regulatory changes could also affect its ability to obtain funding in order to prepare for the possibility of such scenario management has adopted contingency plans for raising financing under stress scenarios when important sources of funds that are usually fully available are temporarily unavailable these plans call for using alternate funding mechanisms such as the pledging of certain asset classes and accessing secured credit lines and loan facilities put in place with the fhlb and the frb the corporation is subject to positive tangible capital requirements to utilize secured loan facilities with the fhlb that could result in a limitation of borrowing amounts or maturity terms even if the corporation exceeds wellcapitalized regulatory capital levels the credit ratings of populars debt obligations are a relevant factor for liquidity because they impact the corporations ability to borrow in the capital markets its cost and access to funding sources credit ratings are based on the financial strength credit quality and concentrations in the loan portfolio the level and volatility of earnings capital adequacy the quality of management geographic concentration in puerto rico the liquidity of the balance sheet the availability of a significant base of core retail and commercial deposits and the corporations ability to access a broad array of wholesale funding sources among other factors furthermore various statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends an insured depository institution may pay to its holding company without regulatory approval a member bank must obtain the approval of the federal reserve board for any dividend if the total of all dividends declared by the member bank during the calendar year would exceed the total of its net income for that year combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years after considering those years dividend activity less any required transfers to surplus or to a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock during the year ended december bppr declared cash dividends of million at december bppr can declare a dividend of approximately million without prior approval of the federal reserve board due to its retained income declared dividend activity and transfers to statutory reserves over the measurement period in addition a member bank may not declare or pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits as reported in its report of condition and income unless the member bank has received the approval of the federal reserve board a member bank also may not permit any portion of its permanent capital to be withdrawn unless the withdrawal has been approved by the federal reserve board pursuant to these requirements pb may not declare or pay a dividend without the prior approval of the federal reserve board and the nysdfs the ability of a bank subsidiary to upstream dividends to its bhc could thus be impacted by its financial performance and capital including tangible and regulatory capital thus potentially limiting the amount of cash moving up to the bhcs from the banking subsidiaries this could in turn affect the bhcs ability to declare dividends on its outstanding common and preferred stock repurchase its securities or meet its debt obligations for example the corporations banking subsidiaries have historically not used unsecured capital market borrowings to finance its operations and therefore are less sensitive to the level and changes in the corporations overall credit ratings obligations subject to rating triggers or collateral requirements the corporations banking subsidiaries currently do not issue unsecured senior debt as these banking subsidiaries are funded primarily with deposits and secured borrowings the banking subsidiaries had million in deposits at december that are subject to rating triggers in addition certain mortgage servicing and custodial agreements that bppr has with third parties include rating covenants in the event of a credit rating downgrade the third parties have the right to require the institution to engage a substitute cash custodian for escrow deposits andor increase collateral levels securing the recourse obligations also as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements the corporation services residential mortgage loans subject to credit recourse provisions certain contractual agreements require the corporation to post collateral to secure such recourse obligations if the institutions required credit ratings are not maintained collateral pledged by the corporation to secure recourse obligations amounted to approximately million at december the corporation could be required to post additional collateral under the agreements management expects that it would be able to meet additional collateral requirements if and when needed the requirements to post collateral under certain agreements or the loss of escrow deposits could reduce the corporations liquidity resources and impact its operating results credit risk geographic and government risk the corporation is exposed to geographic and government risk the corporations assets and revenue composition by geographical area and by business segment reporting are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements commonwealth of puerto rico a significant portion of our financial activities and credit exposure is concentrated in the commonwealth of puerto rico puerto rico which has faced severe economic and fiscal challenges in the past and may face additional challenges in the future economic performance puerto ricos economy suffered a severe and prolonged recession from to with real gross national product gnp contracting approximately during this period in hurricane maría caused significant damage and destruction across the island resulting in further economic contraction puerto ricos economy has been gradually recovering since in part aided by the large amount of federal disaster relief and recovery assistance funds injected into the puerto rico economy in connection with hurricane maría and other recent natural disasters this growth was interrupted by the economic shock caused by the covid19 pandemic in but has since resumed in part aided by additional federal assistance from pandemicrelated stimulus measures the latest puerto rico economic activity index published by the economic development bank for puerto rico the economic activity index reflected a yearoveryear increase and a monthovermonth decrease in november the economic activity index is a coincident indicator of ongoing economic activity but not a direct measurement of real gnp the puerto rico planning board estimates that puerto ricos real gnp grew during fiscal year july 2022june and projects real gnp growth for fiscal year july 2023june2024 while the puerto rico economy has not directly tracked the united states economy in recent years many of the external factors that impact the puerto rico economy are affected by the policies and performance of the united states economy these external factors include the level of interest rates and the rate of inflation inflation in the united states as measured by the united states consumer price index published by the us bureau of labor statistics increased during the 12month period ended december inflation in puerto rico as measured by the puerto rico consumer price index published by the department of labor and human resources of puerto rico increased during the 12month period ended december the rate of inflation gradually decreased from a mid2022 peak as the federal reserve implemented a series of benchmark interest rate increases fiscal challenges as the puerto rico economy contracted the governments public debt rose rapidly in part from borrowing to cover deficits to pay debt service pension benefits and other government expenditures by the puerto rico government had over billion in combined debt and unfunded pension liabilities had lost access to the capital markets and was in the midst of a fiscal crisis puerto ricos escalating fiscal and economic challenges and imminent widespread defaults in its public debt prompted the us congress to enact the puerto rico oversight management and economic stability act promesa in june promesa created the oversight board with ample powers over puerto ricos fiscal and economic affairs and those of its public corporations instrumentalities and municipalities collectively pr government entities pursuant to promesa the oversight board will be in place until market access is restored and balanced budgets are produced for at least four consecutive years promesa also established two mechanisms for the restructuring of the obligations of pr government entities a title iii which provides an in court process that incorporates many of the powers and provisions of the us bankruptcy code and permits adjustment of a broad range of obligations and b title vi which provides for a largely outofcourt process through which modifications to financial debt can be accepted by a supermajority of creditors and bind holdouts since puerto rico and several of its instrumentalities have availed themselves of the debt restructuring mechanisms of titles iii and vi of promesa the puerto rico government emerged from title iii of promesa in march several instrumentalities including government development bank for puerto rico the puerto rico sales tax financing corporation the puerto rico highways and transportation authority and the puerto rico industrial development company have also completed debt restructurings under titles iii or vi of promesa while the majority of the debt has already been restructured some pr government entities still face significant fiscal challenges for example the puerto rico electric power authority is still in the process of restructuring its debts under title iii of promesa municipalities puerto ricos fiscal and economic challenges have also adversely impacted its municipalities budgetary subsidies to municipalities have gradually declined in recent years and were scheduled to be ultimately eliminated by fiscal year as part of the fiscal measures required by the oversight board however over the past years the oversight board has authorized and funded new appropriations and investments to offset the decline in intergovernmental transfers to municipalities beyond those sources of alternate funding municipalities have also received significant federal disaster and covidrelief funding in recent years according to the latest puerto rico fiscal plan certified by the oversight board taken together the funding available to municipalities in the nearterm is substantial the fiscal plan notes however that the desired progress to achieve fiscal discipline and implement critical reforms has not been achieved and that municipalities must work with the executive branch to analyze the financial needs of each individual municipality and focus on the necessary enhancements in municipal shared services and other municipal and government initiatives pursuant to the fiscal plan once the transformational measures and milestones related to these initiatives are achieved additional funding from the central government may be made available to municipalities to improve fiscal sustainability municipalities are subject to promesa and at the oversight boards request are required to submit fiscal plans and annual budgets to the oversight board for its review and approval they are also required to seek oversight board approval to issue guarantee or modify their debts and to enter into contracts with an aggregate value of million or more with the oversight boards approval municipalities are also eligible to avail themselves of the debt restructuring processes provided by promesa to date however no municipality has been subject to any such debt restructuring process exposure of the corporation the credit quality of bpprs loan portfolio reflects among other things the general economic conditions in puerto rico and other adverse conditions affecting puerto rico consumers and businesses deterioration in the puerto rico economy has resulted in the past and could result in the future in higher delinquencies greater chargeoffs and increased losses which could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations at december the corporations direct exposure to pr government entities totaled million of which million were outstanding compared to million at december of which million were outstanding a deterioration in puerto ricos fiscal and economic situation could adversely affect the value of our puerto rico government obligations resulting in losses to us of the amount outstanding million consists of loans and million are securities million and million respectively at december all of the corporations direct exposure outstanding at december were obligations from various puerto rico municipalities in most cases these were general obligations of a municipality to which the applicable municipality has pledged its good faith credit and unlimited taxing power or special obligations of a municipality to which the applicable municipality has pledged basic property tax or sales tax revenues at december of the corporations exposure to municipal loans and securities was concentrated in the municipalities of san juan guaynabo carolina and caguas for additional discussion of the corporations direct exposure to the puerto rico government and its instrumentalities and municipalities refer to note commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in addition at december the corporation had million in loans insured or securities issued by puerto rico governmental entities but for which the principal source of repayment is nongovernmental million at december these included million in residential mortgage loans insured by the puerto rico housing finance authority hfa a pr government entity december million these mortgage loans are secured by first mortgages on puerto rico residential properties and the hfa insurance covers losses in the event of a borrower default and upon the satisfaction of certain other conditions the corporation also had at december million in bonds issued by hfa which are secured by second mortgage loans on puerto rico residential properties and for which hfa also provides insurance to cover losses in the event of a borrower default and upon the satisfaction of certain other conditions december million in the event that the mortgage loans insured by hfa and held by the corporation directly or those serving as collateral for the hfa bonds default and the collateral is insufficient to satisfy the outstanding balance of these loans hfas ability to honor its insurance will depend among other factors on the financial condition of hfa at the time such obligations become due and payable the corporation does not consider the government guarantee when estimating the credit losses associated with this portfolio bpprs commercial loan portfolio also includes loans to private borrowers who are service providers lessors suppliers or have other relationships with the government these borrowers could be negatively affected by a deterioration in the fiscal and economic situation of pr government entities similarly bpprs mortgage and consumer loan portfolios include loans to government employees and retirees which could also be negatively affected by fiscal measures such as employee layoffs or furloughs or reductions in pension benefits if the fiscal and economic situation deteriorates as of december bppr had billion in deposits from the puerto rico government its instrumentalities and municipalities the rate at which public deposit balances may decline is uncertain and difficult to predict the amount and timing of any such reduction is likely to be impacted by for example the speed at which federal assistance is distributed and the financial condition liquidity and cash management practices of such entities as well as on the ability of bppr to maintain these customer relationships the corporation may also have direct exposure with regards to avoidance and other causes of action initiated by the oversight board on behalf of the commonwealth or other title iii debtors for additional information regarding such exposure refer to note to the consolidated financial statements united states virgin islands the corporation has operations in the united states virgin islands the usvi and has credit exposure to usvi government entities the usvi has been experiencing a number of fiscal and economic challenges which could adversely affect the ability of its public corporations and instrumentalities to service their outstanding debt obligations promesa does not apply to the usvi and as such there is currently no federal legislation permitting the restructuring of the debts of the usvi and its public corporations and instrumentalities to the extent that the fiscal condition of the usvi continues to deteriorate the us congress or the government of the usvi may enact legislation allowing for the restructuring of the financial obligations of usvi government entities or imposing a stay on creditor remedies including by making promesa applicable to the usvi at december the corporation had approximately million in direct exposure to usvi government entities december million british virgin islands the corporation has operations in the british virgin islands bvi which was negatively affected by the covid19 pandemic particularly as a reduction in the tourism activity which accounts for a significant portion of its economy although the corporation has no significant exposure to a single borrower in the bvi at december it has a loan portfolio amounting to approximately million comprised of various retail and commercial clients compared to a loan portfolio of million at december us government as further detailed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements a

loan segments impacted by expected prepayments the acl is maintained at a sufficient level to provide for estimated credit losses on collateral dependent loans as well as loans modified for borrowers with financial difficulties separately from the remainder of the loan portfolio the corporations management evaluates the adequacy of the acl on a quarterly basis in this evaluation management considers current conditions macroeconomic economic expectations through a reasonable and supportable period historical loss experience portfolio composition by loan type and risk characteristics results of periodic credit reviews of individual loans and regulatory requirements amongst other factors the corporation must rely on estimates and exercise judgment regarding matters where the ultimate outcome is unknown such as economic developments affecting specific customers industries or markets other factors that can affect managements estimates are recalibration of statistical models used to calculate lifetime expected losses changes in underwriting standards financial accounting standards and loan impairment measurements among others changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers in economic conditions and in the condition of the various markets in which collateral may be sold may also affect the required level of the allowance for credit losses consequently the business financial condition liquidity capital and results of operations could also be affected at december the allowance for credit losses amounted to million an increase of million when compared with december the acl for bppr increased by million to million when compared to december mostly driven by changes in the economic scenario higher loan volumes and changes in credit quality the acl for popular us decreased by million to million when compared to december due to the implementation of a new model for the us commercial real estate portfolio the new model is based on more granular regional information for the corporations portfolio and accounted for million of pbs reduction in acl given that any one economic outlook is inherently uncertain the corporation leverages multiple scenarios to estimate its acl the baseline scenario continues to be assigned the highest probability followed by the pessimistic scenario the corporation evaluates at least on an
