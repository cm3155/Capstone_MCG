description of the corporations business and risk factors contained in part i items and of the corporations accordingly three major this evaluation is composed of components us mainland operations puerto rico banking operations and holding company for the evaluation of the realization of the deferred tax asset by taxing jurisdiction refer to note under the puerto rico internal revenue code the corporation and its subsidiaries are treated as separate taxable entities and are not entitled to file consolidated tax returns the code provides a dividendsreceived deduction of on dividends received from controlled subsidiaries subject to taxation in puerto rico and on dividends received from other taxable domestic corporations the calculation of periodic income taxes is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments the corporation has recorded two accruals for income taxes i the net estimated amount currently due or to be received from taxing changes in the corporations estimates can occur due to changes in tax rates new business strategies newly enacted issues with taxing authorities guidance and resolution of regarding previously taken tax positions such changes could popular inc annual report affect the amount of accrued taxes the corporation has made tax payments in accordance with estimated tax payments rules any remaining payment will not have any significant impact on liquidity and capital resources profitability the the valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns and future tax consequences represents managements best estimate of those future events changes in managements current estimates due to unanticipated events could have a material impact on the corporations financial condition and results of operations accounting deferred for tax law in evaluating a tax position the position the corporations estimate of the corporation establishes tax liabilities or reduces tax assets for uncertain tax positions when despite its assessment that its tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local the corporation believes it may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged the corporation determines whether it is morelikelythannot that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement the corporation evaluates these uncertain tax positions each quarter and adjusts the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations the corporation believes the estimates and assumptions used to support its evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable tax rate was after consideration of the effect on us federal tax of unrecognized us state tax benefits the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits including us and puerto rico that if recognized through earnings would affect the corporations approximately million at effective december and million at december refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on this subject matter the corporation anticipates a reduction in the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next months which could amount to approximately million including interest the amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease in the future for various reasons including adding amounts for current tax year positions expiration of open income tax returns due to the statutes of limitation changes in managements judgment about the level of uncertainty status of examinations litigation and legislative activity and the addition or elimination of uncertain tax positions although the outcome of tax audits is uncertain the corporation believes that adequate amounts of tax interest and penalties have been provided for any adjustments that are expected to result from open years from time to time the corporation is audited by various federal state and local authorities regarding income tax matters although management believes its approach in determining the appropriate tax treatment is supportable and in accordance with the accounting standards it is possible that the final tax authority will take a tax position that is different than the tax position reflected in the corporations income tax provision and other tax reserves as each audit is conducted adjustments appropriately recorded in the consolidated financial statement in the period determined such differences could have an adverse effect on the corporations income tax provision or benefit or other tax reserves in the reporting period in which such determination is made and consequently on the corporations results of operations financial position and or cash flows for such period any are if goodwill and other intangible assets the corporations goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets having an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment intangibles with indefinite lives are evaluated for impairment at least annually and on a more frequent basis if events or circumstances indicate impairment could have taken place such events could include among others a significant adverse change in the business climate an adverse action by a regulator an unanticipated change in the competitive environment and a decision to change the operations or dispose of a reporting unit other identifiable intangible assets with a finite useful life are evaluated periodically for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable goodwill is recognized when the carrying amount of any of the reporting units exceeds its fair value up to the amount of the goodwill the corporation estimates the fair value of each reporting unit consistent with the requirements of the fair value measurements accounting standard generally using a combination of methods including market price multiples of comparable companies and transactions as well as discounted cash flow analyses subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted under applicable accounting standards no impairment was recognized by the corporation test as of july for a detailed from the annual description of impairment evaluation performed by the corporation during the third quarter of refer to note the annual goodwill impairment at december goodwill amounted to million during the year ended december the corporation recognized an impairment loss of million associated with a trademark note to the consolidated financial statements provides the assignment of goodwill by reportable segment popular inc annual report pension and postretirement benefit obligations the corporation provides pension and restoration benefit plans for certain employees of various subsidiaries the corporation also provides certain health care benefits for retired employees of bppr the noncontributory defined pension and benefit restoration plans the pension plans are frozen with regards to all future benefit accruals recorded amounts the estimated benefit costs and obligations of the pension plans and postretirement health care benefit plan opeb plan are impacted by the use of subjective assumptions including which can materially affect expected returns on plan assets discount rates termination rates retirement rates and health care trend rates management applies judgment in the determination of these factors which normally undergo evaluation against current industry practice and the actual experience of the corporation the corporation uses an independent actuarial firm for assistance in the determination of the pension plans and opeb plan costs and obligations detailed information on the plans and related valuation assumptions are included in note to the consolidated financial statements fair value assets at december the corporation periodically reviews its assumption for the longterm expected return on pension plans assets the pension was plans million the expected return on plan assets is determined by considering various factors including a total fund return estimate based on a weightedaverage of estimated returns for each asset class in each plan asset class returns are estimated using current and projected economic and market factors such as real rates of return inflation credit spreads equity risk premiums and excess return expectations as part of the review the corporations independent consulting actuaries performed an analysis of expected returns based on each plans expected asset allocation for the year using the willis towers watson us expected return estimator this analysis is reviewed by the corporation and used as a tool to develop expected rates of return together with other data this forecast reflects the actuarial firms view of expected long term rates of return for each significant asset class or economic indicator as of january for example for large cap stocks for small cap stocks for international stocks for long corporate bonds and for long treasury bonds a range of expected investment returns is developed and this range relies both on forecasts and on broadmarket historical benchmarks for expected returns correlations and volatilities for each asset class as a consequence of the corporation recent decreased its expected return on plan assets for year to and for the pension plans expected rates of return of and had been used for and and had been used for for the pension plans since the expected return assumption is on a longterm basis it is not reviews popular inc annual report materially impacted by the yearly fluctuations either positive or negative in the actual return on assets the expected return can be materially impacted by a change in the plans asset allocation net periodic benefit cost pension expense for the pension plans amounted to a net benefit of million in the total pension expense included a benefit of million for the expected return on assets pension expense is sensitive to changes in the expected return on assets for example decreasing the expected rate of return for from to would increase the projected pension expense for the banco popular de puerto rico retirement plan the corporations largest plan by approximately million if the projected benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets the corporation shall recognize a liability equal to the unfunded projected benefit obligation and vice versa if the fair value of plan assets exceeds the projected benefit obligation the corporation recognizes an asset equal to the overfunded projected benefit obligation this asset or liability may result in a taxable or deductible temporary difference and its tax effect shall be recognized as an income tax expense or benefit which shall be allocated to various components of the financial statements including other comprehensive income the determination of the fair value of pension plan obligations involves judgment and any changes in those estimates could impact the corporations consolidated statements of financial condition management believes that the fair value estimates of the pension plans assets are reasonable given the valuation methodologies used to measure the investments at fair value as described in note also the compositions of the plan assets are primarily in equity and debt securities which have readily determinable quoted market prices the corporation had recorded a pension asset of million and a pension liability of million at december the corporation uses the spot rate yield curve from the willis towers watson rate link model to discount the expected projected cash flows of the plans the equivalent single weighted average discount rate ranged from to for the pension plans and for the opeb plan to determine the benefit obligations at december a basis point decrease to each of the rates in the december willis towers watson rate link model would increase the projected expense for the banco popular de puerto rico retirement plan by approximately million the change would not affect the minimum required contribution to the pension plans the opeb plan was unfunded no assets were held by the plan at december the corporation had recorded a liability for the underfunded postretirement benefit obligation of million at december interest statement of operations analysis

of interest rate risk including repricing basis yield in managing interest curve and option risks rate risk management may alter the mix of floating and fixed rate assets and liabilities change pricing schedules adjust maturities through sales and purchases of investment securities and enter into derivative contracts among other alternatives interest rate risk management is an active process that encompasses monitoring loan and deposit flows complemented by investment and funding activities effective management of interest rate risk begins with understanding the dynamic characteristics of assets and liabilities and determining the appropriate rate risk position given line of business forecasts management objectives market and policy constraints expectations management utilizes various tools to assess irr including net interest income nii simulation modeling static gap analysis and economic value of equity eve the three methodologies complement each other and are used jointly in the evaluation of simulation modeling is prepared for a fiveyear period which in conjunction with the eve analysis provides management a better view of longterm irr the corporations irr nii net interest income simulation analysis performed by legal entity and on a consolidated basis is a tool used by the corporation in estimating the potential change in net interest income resulting from hypothetical changes in interest rates sensitivity analysis is calculated using a simulation model which incorporates actual balance sheet figures detailed by maturity and interest yields or costs management assesses interest rate risk by comparing various nii simulations under different interest rate scenarios that differ in direction of interest rate changes the degree of change and the projected shape of the yield curve for example the types of rate scenarios processed during the quarter include flat rates implied forwards and parallel and nonparallel rate shocks management also performs analyses to isolate and measure basis and prepayment risk exposures the asset and liability management group performs validation procedures on various assumptions used as part of the simulation analyses as well as validations of results on a monthly basis in addition the model and processes used to assess irr are subject to independent validations according to the guidelines established in the model governance and validation policy in these market the corporation processes nii simulations under interest rate scenarios in which the yield curve is assumed to rise and decline by the same amount parallel shifts the rate scenarios considered reflect instantaneous parallel changes of and basis points during the succeeding twelvemonth period simulation analyses are based on many assumptions including relative levels of market interest rates across all yield curve points and indexes interest rate spreads loan prepayments and deposit elasticity thus they should not be relied upon as simulations risk popular inc annual report indicative of actual results further the estimates do not contemplate actions that management could take to respond to changes in interest rates by their nature these forwardlooking computations are only estimates and may be different from what may actually occur in the future the following table presents the results of the simulations at december and december assuming a static balance sheet and parallel changes over flat spot rates over a oneyear time horizon table net interest income sensitivity one year projection december december amount change percent change amount change percent change continue to be close to their lower bound and popular does not allow rates to turn negative in its irr simulations the corporations loan and investment portfolios are subject to prepayment risk which results from the ability of a third party to repay debt obligations prior to maturity prepayment risk also could have a significant impact on the duration of collateralized mortgage mortgagebacked obligations lower prepayments could extend the weighted average life of these portfolios could shorten or since prepayments securities and dollars in thousands change in interest rate basis points basis points basis points basis points basis points simulations as of december nii show the corporation maintains an asset sensitive position and is expected to benefit from an overall rising rate environment the increases in sensitivity for the period are primarily driven by the significant deposit increases seen in which have resulted in a higher level of shortterm investments and cash reserves maintained at the federal reserve these assets reprice immediately under the nii simulations thus improving the nii benefit in rising rate scenarios the declining rate scenarios show a smaller and asymmetric impact in sensitivity as rates popular inc annual report table interest rate sensitivity dollars in thousands days after three

of adherence with established policies an institutions liquidity may be pressured if for example it experiences a sudden and unexpected substantial cash outflow due to exogenous events such as the current covid19 pandemic its credit rating is downgraded or some other event causes counterparties to avoid exposure to the institution factors that the corporation does not control such as the

on certain serviced portfolios the banking subsidiaries assume liquidity risk related to collateral posting requirements for certain activities mainly in connection with servicing contractual recourse provisions and operational expenses also commitments repayment of advances derivatives credit card licensing agreements and support to several mutual funds administered by bppr the banking subsidiaries maintain sufficient funding capacity to address large increases in funding requirements such as deposit outflows the corporation has established liquidity guidelines that require the banking subsidiaries to have sufficient liquidity to cover all shortterm borrowings and a portion of deposits recognized credit the corporations ability to compete successfully in the marketplace for deposits excluding brokered deposits depends on various factors including pricing service convenience and financial stability as reflected by operating results credit ratings by nationally and importantly fdic deposit insurance although a downgrade in the credit ratings of the corporations banking subsidiaries may impact their ability to raise retail and commercial deposits or the rate that it is required to pay on such deposits management does not believe that the impact should be material deposits at the corporations banking subsidiaries are federally all of insured subject to fdic limits and this is expected to mitigate the potential effect of a downgrade in the credit ratings agencies rating deposits are a key source of funding as they tend to be less volatile than institutional borrowings and their cost is less sensitive to changes in market rates refer to table for a breakdown of deposits by major types core deposits are generated from a large base of consumer corporate and public sector customers core deposits include all noninterest bearing deposits savings deposits and certificates of deposit under excluding brokered deposits with denominations under

bearing demand accounts certificates of deposit total interest bearing deposits total average deposits the corporation had billion in brokered deposits at december which financed approximately of its total assets december billion and respectively in the event that any of the corporations banking subsidiaries regulatory capital ratios fall below those required by a wellcapitalized institution or are subject to capital restrictions by the regulators that banking subsidiary faces the risk of not being able to raise or maintain brokered deposits and faces limitations on the rate paid on deposits which may hinder the corporations ability to effectively compete in its retail markets and could affect its deposit raising efforts deposits from the public sector represent an important source of funds for the corporation as of december total public sector deposits were billion compared to billion at december generally these deposits require that the bank pledge high credit quality securities as collateral therefore liquidity risks arising from public sector deposit outflows are lower given that the bank receives its collateral in return this now unpledged collateral can either be financed via repurchase agreements or sold for cash however there are some timing differences between the time the deposit outflow occurs and when the bank receives its collateral at december management believes that the banking subsidiaries had sufficient current and projected liquidity sources to meet their anticipated cash flow obligations as well as special needs and offbalance sheet commitments in the ordinary course of business and have sufficient liquidity resources to address a stress event although the banking subsidiaries have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances no assurance can be given that they would be able to replace those funds in the future if the corporations financial condition or general market conditions were to deteriorate the corporations financial flexibility will be severely constrained if the banking subsidiaries are unable to maintain access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future financing needs at acceptable interest rates the banking subsidiaries also are required to to meet margin deposit cash or qualifying securities popular inc annual report for the years ended december that the value of securities requirements to the extent previously pledged as collateral declines because of market changes the corporation will be required to deposit additional cash or securities to meet its margin requirements thereby is adversely affecting its liquidity finally required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to meet its future growth revenues may not increase proportionately to cover costs in this case profitability would be adversely affected if management investment securities dividends bank holding companies the principal sources of funding for the bhcs which are popular inc holding company only and pna include cash received from on hand banking and nonbanking subsidiaries asset sales credit facilities available from affiliate banking subsidiaries and proceeds from potential securities offerings dividends from banking and nonbanking subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory limits and authorization requirements that are further described below and that may limit the ability of those subsidiaries to act as a source of funding to the bhcs the principal use of these funds includes the repayment of debt and interest payments to holders of senior debt and junior subordinated deferrable interest related to trust preferred securities the payment of dividends to common stockholders and capitalizing its banking subsidiaries the cash needs of the bhcs have in the past borrowed in the money markets and in the corporate debt market primarily to finance their nonbanking subsidiaries however the corporations nonbanking subsidiaries other than to repay indebtedness and interest are now minimal these sources of funding are more costly due to the fact that two out of the three principal credit rating agencies rate the corporation below investment grade which affects the corporations cost and ability to raise funds in the capital markets the corporation has an automatic shelf registration statement filed and effective with the

thereby reducing the collateral requirements may increase balance of unpledged securities requirements as their fair value increases ratios other and for the importance of the puerto rico market the corporation is an additional risk factor that could affect its financing activities in the case of a deterioration in economic and fiscal conditions in puerto rico the credit quality of the corporation could be affected and result in higher credit costs refer to the geographic and government risk section of this mda for some highlights on the current status of the puerto rico economy and the ongoing fiscal crisis factors that the corporation does not control such as the economic outlook and credit ratings of its principal markets and regulatory changes could also affect its ability to obtain funding in order to prepare for the possibility of such scenario management has raising financing under stress scenarios when important sources of temporarily are fully funds unavailable these plans call for using alternate funding mechanisms such as the pledging of certain asset classes and accessing secured credit lines and loan facilities put in place with the fhlb and the frb adopted contingency plans are usually available that for the credit ratings of populars debt obligations are a relevant factor for liquidity because they impact the corporations ability to borrow in the capital markets its cost and access to funding sources credit ratings are based on the financial strength credit quality and concentrations in the loan portfolio the level and volatility of earnings capital adequacy the quality of management geographic concentration in puerto rico the liquidity of the balance sheet the availability of a significant base of and the corporations ability to access a broad array of wholesale funding sources among other factors and commercial deposits retail core furthermore various statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends an insured depository institution may pay to its holding company without regulatory approval a member bank must obtain the approval of the federal reserve board for any dividend if the total of all dividends declared by the member bank during the calendar year would exceed the total of its net income for that year combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years after considering those years dividend activity less any required transfers to surplus or to a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock during the year ended december bppr declared cash dividends of million at december bppr would have needed to obtain prior approval of the federal reserve board before declaring a dividend due to its declared dividend activity and transfers to statutory reserves over the three years ended december in addition a member bank may not declare or pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits as reported in its report of condition and income unless the member bank has received the approval of the federal reserve board a member bank also may not permit any portion of its permanent capital to be withdrawn unless the withdrawal has been approved by the federal reserve board pursuant to these requirements pb may not declare or pay a dividend without the prior approval of the federal reserve board and the nysdfs the ability of a bank subsidiary to upstream dividends to its bhc could thus be impacted by its financial performance thus potentially limiting the amount of cash moving up to the bhcs from the banking subsidiaries this could in turn affect the bhcs ability to declare dividends on its outstanding common and preferred stock for example popular inc annual report the corporations banking subsidiaries have historically not used unsecured capital market borrowings to finance its operations and therefore are less sensitive to the level and changes in the corporations overall credit ratings obligations subject to rating triggers or collateral requirements the corporations banking subsidiaries currently do not use borrowings that are rated by the major rating agencies as these banking subsidiaries are funded primarily with deposits and secured borrowings the banking subsidiaries had million in deposits at december that are subject to rating triggers in addition certain mortgage servicing and custodial agreements that bppr has with third parties include rating covenants in the event of a credit rating downgrade the third parties have the right to require the institution to engage a substitute cash custodian for escrow deposits andor increase levels securing the recourse obligations also as collateral discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements the corporation services residential mortgage loans subject to credit recourse provisions certain contractual agreements to secure such require the corporation to post collateral recourse obligations if the institutions required credit ratings are not maintained collateral pledged by the corporation to secure amounted to approximately million at december the corporation could be required to post additional collateral under the agreements management expects that it would be able to meet additional collateral requirements if and when needed the requirements to post collateral under certain agreements or the loss of escrow deposits could reduce the corporations liquidity resources and impact its operating results recourse obligations credit risk geographic and government risk the corporation is exposed to geographic and government risk the corporations composition by geographical area and by business segment reporting are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements and revenue assets commonwealth of puerto rico a significant portion of our financial activities and credit exposure is concentrated in the commonwealth of puerto rico the commonwealth or puerto rico which faces severe economic and fiscal challenges covid19 pandemic on december a novel strain of coronavirus covid19 surfaced in wuhan china and has since spread globally to other countries and jurisdictions including the mainland united states and puerto rico in march the world health organization declared covid19 a pandemic the popular inc annual report pandemic has significantly disrupted and negatively impacted the global economy disrupted global supply chains created significant volatility in financial markets and increased unemployment levels worldwide including in the markets in which we do business in place to shelter in puerto rico former governor wanda vázquez issued an executive order in march declaring a health emergency ordering residents implementing a mandatory curfew and requiring the closure of nonessential businesses although the most restrictive measures have been eased or lifted allowing for the gradual reopening of the economy certain measures remain in place and additional measures may be implemented in the future as a result of a resurgence in the spread of the virus or new strains of the virus since the beginning of the pandemic most businesses have had to make significant adjustments to protect customers and employees including transitioning to telework and suspending or modifying certain operations in compliance with health and safety guidelines the puerto rico legislative assembly enacted legislation in april requiring financial institutions to offer moratoriums on consumer to clients impacted by the covid19 pandemic which was effective through august the federal government has also approved several economic stimulus measures that seek to cushion the economic fallout of including providing direct subsidies expanding eligibility for and increasing unemployment benefits and guaranteeing through the sba ppp loans to small and medium businesses financial products the pandemic the covid19 pandemic and the restrictions imposed to curb the spread of the disease have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on economic activity worldwide including in puerto rico the extent to which the covid19 pandemic will continue to adversely affect economic activity will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict including the scope and duration of the pandemic including the appearance of new strains of the virus the restrictions imposed by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the same the pace of global vaccination efforts and the amount of federal the and local assistance offered to offset pandemic pursuant to the fiscal plan as defined below economic stimulus measures have more than offset the estimated income loss due to reduced economic activity in puerto rico and are estimated to have caused a temporary increase in personal income on a net basis however there can be no assurance that these measures will be sufficient to offset the pandemics economic impact in the medium and long term the impact of economic performance the commonwealths economy entered a recession in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and its gross national product gnp contracted in real terms every fiscal year between and with the exception of fiscal year pursuant to the latest puerto rico planning board the planning board estimates dated march the commonwealths real gnp increased by in fiscal year due to the influx of federal funds and private insurance payments to repair damage caused by hurricanes irma and maría however the planning board estimates that the commonwealths real gnp decreased by approximately in fiscal year due primarily to the adverse impact of the covid19 pandemic and the measures taken by the government in response to the same the planning board projected that the negative effects of covid19 would continue through fiscal year resulting in a contraction in real gnp of approximately followed by gnp growth in the current fiscal year corporations fiscal crisis its the commonwealths central government and many of instrumentalities public and municipalities continue to face significant fiscal challenges which have been primarily the result of economic contraction persistent and significant budget deficits a high debt burden unfunded legacy obligations and lack of access to the capital markets among other factors as a result the commonwealth and certain of its instrumentalities have been unable to make debt service payments on their outstanding bonds and notes since the escalating fiscal and economic crisis and imminent widespread defaults prompted the us congress to enact the puerto rico oversight management stability act and promesa in june as further discussed below under pending title iii proceedings the commonwealth and several of its instrumentalities are currently in the process of restructuring restructuring their debts mechanisms provided by promesa through the debt economic for and established two mechanisms promesa things created a sevenmember promesa among other federallyappointed oversight board the oversight board with ample powers over the fiscal and economic affairs of the commonwealth its public corporations instrumentalities and the municipalities restructuring of the obligations of such entities pursuant to promesa the oversight board will remain in place until market access is restored and balanced budgets in accordance with modified accrual accounting are produced for at least four consecutive years in august president obama appointed the seven original voting members of the oversight board through the process established in promesa which authorizes the president to select the members from several lists required to be submitted by congressional in when president donald trump reappointed three of the original members and appointed four new members to the oversight board leaders its public corporations in october the oversight board designated the and commonwealth and all of instrumentalities as covered entities under promesa the only commonwealth government entities that were not subject to such initial designation were the commonwealths municipalities in may however the oversight board designated all of the commonwealths municipalities as covered entities at the oversight boards request covered entities are required to submit fiscal plans and annual budgets to the oversight board for its review and approval they are also required to seek oversight board approval to issue guarantee or modify their debts and to enter into contracts with an aggregate value of million or more finally covered entities are potentially eligible to avail the debt restructuring processes provided by promesa for additional discussion of risk factors related to the puerto rico fiscal challenges see part i item risk factors in this form 10k themselves of fiscal plans commonwealth fiscal plan the oversight board has certified several fiscal plans for the commonwealth since the most recent fiscal plan for the commonwealth certified by the oversight board is dated january the fiscal plan and activity reduced economic pursuant to the fiscal plan while the covid19 pandemic and the measures taken in response to the same caused severely an unprecedented increase in unemployment in puerto rico pandemicrelated federal and local stimulus funding have more than offset the estimated income loss due to reduced economic activity and are estimated to have caused a temporary increase in personal income on a net basis the fiscal plans economic projections incorporate adjustments for these short term income effects for purposes of estimating tax receipts for example the fiscal plan estimates that for fiscal years and real gnp will grow and respectively but projects that growth adjusted for income effects for such years will be approximately and respectively the fiscal plan incorporates the debt service costs of the commonwealths restructured debt as contemplated by the plan of adjustment as defined and further explained below therefore it projects an unrestricted surplus after debt service average of billion annually between fiscal years to this surplus declines over time as federal disaster relief funding slows nominal gnp growth declines revenues decline rise the fiscal plan and healthcare expenditures estimates fiscal measures could drive approximately billion in savings and extra revenue over fiscal years through and that structural reforms could drive a cumulative increase in growth by fiscal year equal to approximately billion that popular inc annual report by approximately the impact of the fiscal plan provides for the gradual reduction and the ultimate elimination of commonwealth budgetary subsidies to municipalities which constitute a material portion of the operating revenues of some municipalities since fiscal year commonwealth appropriations to municipalities have decreased from approximately million in fiscal year to approximately million in fiscal year in response to the covid19 crisis reductions in appropriations to municipalities were paused in fiscal year municipalities have also received extraordinary appropriations and other funds from federallyfunded programs during the current fiscal year which has helped temporarily the reduced commonwealth support offset however additional the fiscal plan contemplates reductions in appropriations to municipalities starting in fiscal year before eventually phasing out all appropriations in fiscal year further while the commonwealth had enacted legislation in suspending the municipalitys obligations to contribute to the commonwealths health plan and payasyou go retirement system such legislation was challenged by the oversight board and eventually declared null by the title iii court in april as a result municipalities are required to cover their own employees healthcare costs and retirement benefits and had to reimburse the commonwealth for such costs corresponding to the period during which the law was in effect finally the fiscal plan notes that towards municipalities have made little or no progress implementing fiscal discipline required to reduce reliance on commonwealth appropriations and that fiscal management threatens the ability of municipalities to provide necessary services such as health sanitation public safety and emergency services to their residents forcing them to prioritize expenditures this lack of electric power utility other fiscal plans pursuant to promesa the oversight board has also requested and certified fiscal plans for several public corporations and instrumentalities the certified fiscal plan for the puerto rico electric power authority prepa puerto ricos contemplated the transformation of puerto ricos electric system through among other things the establishment of a publicprivate partnership with respect to prepas transmission and distribution system the td system and calls for significant structural reforms at prepa the procurement process for the establishment of a publicprivate partnership with respect to the td system was completed in june the selected proponent luma energy llc luma and prepa entered into a 15year agreement whereby since june luma is responsible for operating maintaining and modernizing the td system on april the oversight board certified the latest version of the fiscal plan the crim fiscal plan for the municipal revenue collection center the government entity responsible for collecting property taxes and distributing them among the municipalities the crim fiscal crim popular inc annual report enhancement of property tax collections plan outlines a series of measures centered around improving the competitiveness of puerto ricos property tax regime and including the identifying as improvements and implementing operational and technological initiatives and appraising new properties to existing properties as well the oversight board on behalf of pending title iii proceedings on may the commonwealth filed a petition in the us district court to restructure the commonwealths liabilities under title iii of promesa

provided a process the commonwealths fiscal crisis the complexity and uncertainty of the title iii proceedings for the commonwealth and various of its instrumentalities and the adjustment measures required by the fiscal plans still present significant economic risks in addition the covid19 outbreak has affected many of our individual customers and customers businesses this when added to puerto

impact our interest and noninterest to address revenues if global or local economic conditions worsen or the government of puerto rico and the oversight board are unable to adequately manage the

in credit quality and the macroeconomic outlook since the december scenarios updated economic assumptions have included a more optimistic view of the economy prompting substantial reductions in
