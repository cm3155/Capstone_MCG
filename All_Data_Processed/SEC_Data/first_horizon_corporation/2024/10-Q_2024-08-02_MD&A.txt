securities and the interest expense incurred in connection with interestbearing liabilities generally deposits and borrowed funds the level of net interest income is primarily a function of the difference between the effective yield on average interestearning assets and the effective cost of interestbearing liabilities these factors are influenced by the pricing and mix of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities which in turn are impacted by external factors such as local economic conditions competition for loans and deposits the monetary policy of the frb and market

with a 1year lookback period at a confidence level with 1day and 10day time horizons additionally fhn computes a stressed var measure the svar computation uses the same model but with model inputs reflecting historical data from a continuous 12month period that reflects a period of significant financial stress appropriate for our trading securities portfolio a summary of fhns var and svar

dynamic 2q24 form 10q report part i item managements discussion analysis mda rather than static as a result it would be rare for fhnf to incur a negative revenue day in its fixed income activities at the levels indicated by its var measures in addition to being used in fhns daily market risk management process the var and svar measures are also used by fhn in computing its regulatory market risk capital requirements in accordance with the market risk capital rules for additional information regarding fhns capital adequacy refer to the capital section of this mda fhn also performs stress tests on its trading securities portfolio to calculate the potential loss under various assumed market scenarios key assumed stresses used in those tests are down bps assumes an instantaneous downward move in interest rates of basis points at all points on the interest rate yield curve up bps assumes an instantaneous upward move in interest rates of basis points at all points on the interest rate yield curve curve flattening assumes an instantaneous flattening of the interest rate yield curve through an increase in shortterm rates and a decrease in longterm rates the 2year point on the treasury yield curve is assumed to increase basis points and the 10year point on the treasury yield curve is assumed to decrease basis points shifts in other points on the yield curve are predicted based on their correlation to the 2year and 10year points curve steepening assumes an instantaneous steepening of the interest rate yield curve through a decrease in shortterm rates and an increase in longterm rates the 2year point on the treasury yield curve is assumed to decrease basis points and the 10year point on the treasury yield curve is assumed to increase basis points shifts in other points on the yield curve are predicted based on their correlation to the 2year and 10year points credit spread widening assumes an instantaneous increase in credit spreads the difference between yields on treasury securities and nontreasury securities of basis points model validation trading risk management personnel within fhn financial have primary responsibility for model risk management with respect to the model used by fhn to compute its var measures and perform stress testing on the trading inventory among other procedures these personnel monitor model results and perform periodic backtesting as part of an ongoing process of validating the accuracy of the model these model risk management activities are subject to annual review by fhns model validation group an independent assurance group charged

regarding the outcomes of simulation analysis and rate shock analysis is forwardlooking actual results if the assumed scenarios were to occur could differ because of interest rate movements the ability of management to execute its business plans and other factors including those presented in the forwardlooking statements section of this report management uses a simulation model to measure interest rate risk and to formulate strategies to improve balance sheet positioning earnings or both within fhns interest rate risk liquidity and capital guidelines interest rate exposure is measured by forecasting months of nii under various interest rate scenarios and comparing the percentage change in nii for each scenario to a base case scenario where interest rates remain unchanged assumptions are made regarding future balance sheet composition interest rate movements and loan and deposit pricing in addition assumptions are made about the magnitude of asset prepayments and earlier than anticipated deposit withdrawals the results of these scenarios help fhn develop strategies for managing exposure to interest rate risk while management believes the assumptions used and scenarios selected in its simulations are reasonable simulation modeling provides only an estimate not a precise calculation of exposure to any given change in interest rates based on a static balance sheet as of june nii expo sures over the next months assuming rate shocks of plusminus basis points plusminus basis points plusminus basis points and plusminus basis points are estimated to have

framework and do not necessarily represent managements current view of future interest rates or market developments shortterm interest rates have reached their highest levels in years which coupled with market disruption from recent high profile bank failures has increased competitive pressures on deposit costs the yield curve was inverted for much of the last half of throughout and during the

prospective trends below liquidity risk management among other things alco is responsible for liquidity management the funding of assets with liabilities of appropriate duration while mitigating the risk of unexpected cash needs alco and the board of directors have adopted a liquidity policy of which the objective is to ensure that fhn meets its cash and collateral obligations promptly in a costeffective manner and with the highest degree of reliability the maintenance of adequate levels of asset and liability liquidity should provide fhn with the ability to meet both expected and unexpected cash and collateral needs key liquidity ratios asset liquidity levels and the amount available from funding sources are reported to alco on a regular basis fhns liquidity policy establishes

payment of a dividend to shareholders of fhn is dependent on several factors which are considered by the board these factors include fhns current and prospective capital liquidity and other needs applicable regulatory restrictions including capital conservation buffer requirements and availability of funds to fhn through a dividend from first horizon bank additionally banking regulators generally require insured banks and bank holding companies to pay cash dividends only out of current operating earnings consequently the decision of whether fhn will pay future dividends and the amount of dividends will be affected by current operating results fhn paid a cash dividend of per common share on july fhn paid cash dividends of per series e preferred share and per series f

fhn believes the following trends and events are noteworthy at this time inflation recession and federal reserve policy economic overview the postcovid economy in the us has been marked by strong inflation which began in peaked in and abated though not fully starting in the federal reserve tightening in and the first half of to contain inflation by rapidly increasing shortterm interest rates and ending asset purchases low unemployment rates moderate economic growth and a profoundly inverted yield curve key aspects were although the us economy flirted with recession in it did not officially enter one in recession concerns moderated significantly in recession expectations have remained generally low the rise in shortterm interest rates by the federal reserve in was both rapid and substantial taking the overnight fed funds rate from in march to a year later hikes after that were much more modest and infrequent in the federal reserve signaled that hikes likely have ended and that a short term rate cut might become appropriate at some point in the future no rate actions have been taken since then and no policy or timing commitments have been made future actions continue to depend upon future data in response to 2022s extremely rapid and vigorous tightening of monetary policy the inflation rate in the us now is well below 2022s levels however measures of inflation generally remain higher than the federal reserves stated longterm goal of and the trend is uncertain monetary tightening often creates yield curve inversion for a time in the current cycle traditional inversion when tenyear treasury rates are below twoyear rates has been both very deep and unusually sustained with the current inversion having begun in the summer of 2q24 form 10q report part i item managements discussion analysis mda a shortterm rate cut by the federal reserve should lessen inversion but only if longterm rates do not likewise drop key events and circumstances are noted in the following discussions federal reserve and rates the federal reserve raised shortterm rates several times in and in the first part of all but one of the raises in were and basis points eachaggressive by historical standardswhile the raises were the moretypical basis points each the federal reserve has expressed its intent to bring inflation under control even at the risk of creating or deepening an economic recession the federal reserve has indicated that future decisions will be heavily impacted by economic data especially inflationrate and trend data available at each decision point most recently the federal reserve has indicated an expectation that its next action at an unspecified future point will be a rate cut rather than a rate hike fhn cannot predict exactly when or how much shortterm rates will be changed how marketdriven longterm rates will behave nor how those actions may affect financial markets during the next several quarters yield curve unusual yield curve effects including inversion are common when monetary policy changes a traditional measure of inversion occurs when the twoyear us treasury rate is higher than the tenyear rate traditional inversion has been sustained continuously since the summer of an unusually long period the degree of inversion has varied during that period but often has been much deeper than is typical sustained traditional yield curve inversion is viewed with statistical support as a harbinger of economic recession but recession has not yet occurred and the us economy currently does not appear close to entering one the most recent period with deep and longerlasting inversion was over years ago that year period was marked by stagflation low economic growth coupled with high inflation followed by extremely robust interest rate hikes and a severe recession yield curve flattening and inversion generally reduces the profit fhn can make from lending by compressing fhns net interest margin and also generally reduces fhns revenues from bond trading refer to interest rate yield curve risks located in item risk factors of fhns annual report on form 10k for the year ended december f or a discussion of the risks to fhn associated with flattening and inversion recession the us economy contracted experienced negative growth during the first two quarters of in both cases modestly although two consecutive quarters of contraction often coincides with recession in it did not the economy expanded in each quarter since then the expansion rate has varied without a sustained trend recession expectations in the us were high in and early they moderated significantly after that in recession expectations have fluctuated but generally have remained low fiscal policy the federal reserve controls monetary policy for the us government but not fiscal policy spending and taxation fiscal policy often has a significant impact on the us economy some of the unusual or unexpected aspects of the postcovid economy likely were created or supported by historically unusual fiscal stimulus and other stimulative policies which pushed substantial amounts of money into the economy actions under these policies included cash distributions to most households in cash distributions to many small and medium businesses in and legislation authorizing substantial new spending which continues currently in several sectors of the economy the federal elections in november could result in significant changes in us fiscal policy in and banking crisis in march two large regional us banks failed after sudden large deposit outflows and a major swiss bank was acquired by another bank at the behest of regulators in the aftermath of the two us failures bank investors and clients across the us became more focused on deposit mix funding risk management and other safetysoundness concerns the market values of virtually all us bank stocks fell quickly and strongly in march last year with a few falling about most us banks saw net outflows of deposits in and early as the impacts of covid19 crisis programs faded and rates available from nonbankaccount investments improved according to federal reserve data starting in midmarch the two failures triggered an abrupt and substantial net deposit outflow from all but the largest us banks the march crisis shock was shortlived however during the final week of march both large and small us banks collectively experienced net inflows of deposits roughly mirroring the first week of march before the crisis emerged in early may a third large regional us bank failed after experiencing very large deposit outflows in march although this failure was widely anticipated volatility in regional bank stocks reappeared in may by june bankstock volatility had abated again but with regional bank prices well below precrisis levels although regional bank stock values have recovered significantly in the past year the market remains highly sensitive to actual and feared weaknesses 2q24 form 10q report part i item managements discussion analysis mda impacts on fhn in fhn benefited significantly from rising rates as the rise in lending rates outpaced the rise in deposit and other funding rates in the first quarter of that outpacing ended and fhns net interest margin started to compress fhn was able to reverse the compression during the year fueled in part by using increased deposits and capital to reduce borrowings fhns net interest margin improved in first quarter compared with the previous quarter and was flat in second quarter second quarter improvements in loan spreads largely were offset by higher funding costs in and early fhn experienced a normalization of deposit levels since first quarter as it allowed surge deposits resulting from coviddriven stimulus programs to move off its balance sheet net deposit outflows ranged from roughly to billion in each of the last three quarters of and fell again by roughly billion in first quarter that outflow trend ended in second quarter as fhn had net deposit inflows of billion for the year net deposits increased over billion however fhn increased deposit rates appreciably in particularly in may and june deposit costs abated somewhat in first quarter as 2023s promotional rates reverted to market norms deposit costs started to increase during second quarter in response to heightened competition in many of fhns markets and that competitive environment is expected to continue during the second half of in addition some of fhns businesses have been negatively impacted by higher rates and inversion rate increases have pushed home mortgage rates in the us much higher than in early reducing demand fhns direct mortgage lending and lending to mortgage companies saw business decline significantly in and moreover fhns revenues from bond trading and related activities fell significantly in and due to rising rates coupled with elevated market volatility in first quarter bond trading revenues and mortgage activity improved bond revenues likely benefited from the markets expectation that shortterm rates had peaked and soon would be cut coupled with improved liquidity conditions in the banking sector in second quarter however bond revenues reverted to lower levels as it became clear to the market that rate cuts in would be fewer and later than had been expected a recession if one were to occur likely would have a negative impact on fhns businesses overall demand for loans likely would fall loan losses and provision expense likely would rise many commercial activities that generate fee income likely would decline and competition for clients likely would sharpen the deeper or longer a recession lasts the more significant these negative impacts are likely to be for fhn as mentioned above recessionary expectations remain low currently however just as expectations in early proved to be wrong current expectations may be just as incorrect other regulatory proposals in the board of governors of the federal reserve and other regulators proposed regulatory changes that would if implemented significantly increase regulatory constraints and costs on all us banks with assets over billion a few new requirements would apply to banks like fhn with assets over billion but by far the main impacts would fall on banks greater than billion in assets the proposals touch upon many regulatory requirements including debt and equity capital requirements credit risk standards asset riskweighting and resolution planning the increased requirements also would entail additional compliance costs the triggering of significant cost increases based on a single threshold financial measure100 billion in assetshas been in place for many years and has impacted the us banking industry compliance restrictions and costs increase as the threshold is approached but a stepup pattern remains banks near the threshold may be likely to slow or even halt asset growth at least for a period and start to implement the higherlevel compliance systems banks modestly over the threshold in contrast may be likely to expand their asset base as quickly as possible to generate additional revenues to cover those costs those effects have added to the incentives for banks to consolidate and the proposed new rules are likely to enhance that it appears likely that if adopted as proposed significant parts of the proposals will be challenged in court as being inconsistent with legislation enacted by congress in such a challenge would be technical and complex and likely would take many years to resolve moreover even if a challenge of that sort were successful many parts of the proposals likely would remain intact and others might be modified without being rescinded greenhouse gas ghg reporting regimes in october the state of california enacted laws which taken together will require most larger companies doing business in california to report annually their greenhouse gas ghg emissions with an external assurance requirement and to report biennially their climaterelated financial risks and riskmitigation 2q24 form 10q report part i item managements discussion analysis mda measures the california laws include multiyear phase in periods and encompass scope scope and scope ghg emissions those periods appear likely to be extended somewhat as california reportedly considers supplemental legislation and rulemaking in march the us securities and exchange commission sec adopted final rules the enhancement and standardization of climaterelated disclosures for investors the climate disclosures rules these rules would require all us companies with publiclytraded securities to report annually their scope and ghg emissions and related risk management processes and would include a related financial statement and audit requirement among other things refer to accounting changes below for additional information the secs climate disclosures rules also have a lengthy phasein period europe also has adopted a ghg reporting regime it is not applicable to fhn and is not further discussed here three ghg scopes scope ghg emissions are those from a source the company owns or controls directly such as a manufacturing plant scope emissions are indirect emissions from company activities such as from power consumed by company operations scope and emissions generally can be measured or estimated using information a company normally can obtain without significant external inquiry scope ghg emissions are those from sources and activities that a company neither owns nor controls scope emissions are from a wide range of sources that touch upon a company such as vendors employees commuting business travel etc and customers scope information generally is unknown to a company without significant external inquiry andor estimation potential business impacts direct compliance costs will include creating systems to measure or estimate and capture relevant data staffing and engagement of vendors including a firm to provide required assurances somewhat analogous to a financial statement auditor potentially of more significance california may require inquiry of customers rather than merely estimation about them if fhn is allowed merely to estimate emissions from customers that process may be costly but would not interfere with its business relationships if however fhn is required to support scope reporting by obtaining ghgrelated information from customers including customers that are not public companies and that do no business in california then the california disclosure laws could interfere with fhns business in that case effectively fhn would be required to impose costs andor inconveniences on its customers other banks in fhns markets particularly those that are private and not doing business in california could provide financial services without those requirements putting fhn at a competitive disadvantage legal challenges the california laws especially the application of those laws to companies outside of california have been challenged in court challengers assert that the laws among other things unconstitutionally burden interstate commerce are preempted by federal law and unconstitutionally compel or burden speech challenges could take many years to resolve a key practical question will be whether the courts maintain a legal stay a moratorium on these laws nationwide while challenges are pending the secs climate disclosures rules likewise are being challenged in court challengers assert among other things that the sec lacks explicit congressional authorization to create a regulatory reporting regime pertaining to ghg emissions the several challenges have been consolidated in the us federal 8th circuit possibly anticipating a courtordered stay the sec has suspended the effectiveness of its rules while the court challenges are pending assuming that the various legal challenges leave the secs climate disclosures rules entirely or largely intact the california laws might be further challenged by public companies as having been preempted by the secs rules 2q24 form 10q report part i item managements discussion analysis mda coastal market growth and rising costs fhns principal markets are in the southern and southeastern united states including most of the major gulf coast markets and several markets on the southern atlantic seacoast many of fhns markets have experienced significant population growth over at least the past twenty years outpacing the growth rate for the us as a whole that population growth generally has been accompanied by economic growth many of fhns fastest growing markets including most significantly those in florida can be impacted significantly by hurricanes and other severe coastal weather events as those markets grow fhns economic commitment to them grows as does fhns financial exposure to those events in and this year it has been widely reported that the economic costs of hurricane events in the us gulf and southern atlantic coastal areas have been rising significantly fhn believes that rising costs are directly related to growth in those areas for example much of the growth in florida has been along the coast moving out from older cities a gulf coast hurricane or years ago had a fair chance of making landfall in a relatively unpopulated area now the chances of directly hitting a population center are much higher the average population in that center is much higher and the average value per building is much higher the reported significant increase in casualty risks and costs is being reflected in property insurance practices which currently are in significant flux the insurance industry is being forced to revise its risk assessment and premium pricing practices in coastal areas as loss experience has deviated from earlier predictions sometimes badly in florida for example some smaller carriers have failed some larger carriers have left markets and remaining carriers have significantly increased the premiums of hurricanerelated insurance narrowed coverage or both coastal states such as florida and louisiana have created lastresort insurance pools for residents who cannot obtain or afford private property insurance however as the costs borne by those pools increase either the premiums will have to rise or general taxation will have to cover the difference in addition those programs generally do not help business clients state and local building and watercontrol codes are being revised but often unevenly and often not retroactive to preexisting structures and developments the current transition period could be lengthy the availability reliability and cost of adequate property insurance is a significant concern for fhn as well as fhns clients in affected markets instability in property insurance has made and continues to make fhns business decisions more difficult that instability increases fhns risks of loan loss and business downturn more fundamentally elevated insurance and casualty costs blunt a key factor driving growth in many of these highgrowth markets lower costs of living if market growth slows fhns business will be impacted critical accounting policies and estimates fhn has made no significant changes in its critical accounting policies and estimates from those disclosed in its
