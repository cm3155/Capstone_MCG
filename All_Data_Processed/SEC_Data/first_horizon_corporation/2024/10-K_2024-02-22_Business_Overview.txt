bank our most significant subsidiary is a tennessee banking corporation subject to the regulation and supervision of and to examination by the tdfi in addition to general supervision and examination powers the tdfi has the power to approve mergers with the bank the banks issuance of preferred stock or capital notes the establishment of banking centers and many other corporate actions the bank has chosen to be a member of the federal reserve as a result the federal reserve is the banks primary federal regulator as a member the bank must buy and hold stock in its district federal reserve bank equal to of the banks capital stock and surplus the bank is paid a dividend on its investment at a rate which varies with tenyear us treasury rates capped at the bank cannot sell its investment in federal reserve bank stock and the investment provides the bank with no control over the federal reserve system tennessee law requires the bank as a member of the federal reserve to comply with federal capital and many other regulatory requirements in lieu of or sometimes in addition to state requirements for that reason this supervision and regulation section focuses on federal requirements for many topics related to the bank mentioning state requirements only where significant the bank is insured by and subject to regulation by the fdic and is subject to regulation in certain respects by the cfpb the bank is also subject to various requirements and restrictions under federal and state law including requirements to maintain reserves against deposits restrictions on the types and amounts of loans that may be made and the interest that may be charged limitations on the types of investments that may be made activities that may be engaged in and types of services that may be offered various consumer laws and regulations also affect the operations of the bank in addition several of the banks subsidiaries are regulated separately as discussed in subsidiaries within this item under the other business information discussion above which begins on page in addition to the impact of regulation commercial banks are affected significantly by the actions of the federal reserve as it attempts to control interest rates money supply and credit availability in order to influence the economy also the bank and certain of its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tiein arrangements in table start form 10k annual report table end table start item business table end connection with extensions of credit leases or sales of property or furnishing products or services the regulatory framework governing banks and the financial industry is intended primarily to protect depositors and the federal deposit insurance fund not to protect our bank or our security holders regulatory tiers based on asset size many rules dealing with critical regulatory topics divide banks into tiers based largely or entirely on asset size different topics have different cutoff points for the tiers within each topic different rules apply to the different tiers cutoff points vary significantly however as a rough generalization for many regulatory topics the critical cutoff points are billion billion and billion companies with less than billion are less regulated in several important ways than we are and companies with billion or more are regulated much more severely in many important ways than we are as a result under current law compliance requirements costs and restrictions grow with size they tend to change abruptly as a company crosses to the next tier and we are in a middle tier in many respects the remainder of this supervision and regulation discussion focuses primarily on rules which apply to fhn based on our current asset size largebank supervision risk categories federal regulators have established four riskbased categories for applying enhanced prudential standards enhanced for larger banks category i applies to the global systemically important companies categories ii iii and iv apply with certain exceptions to institutions with total consolidated assets of at least billion billion and billion respectively currently we and the bank are below category ivs floor and therefore generally we are not subject to enhanced prudential standards as a practical matter as we approach billion we will have to prepare for category iv compliance doing that will require us to invest in systems and staffing as a result a portion of the compliance costs associated with category iv status will be borne before we reach the category iv threshold also category iv compliance requirements are proposed to be expanded if adopted compliance costs and restrictions would increase substantially a few of the proposed changes would apply to companies having to billion in total assets like us payment of dividends first horizon corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from first horizon bank and other subsidiaries our principal source of cash flow including cash flow to pay dividends on our stock or to pay principal including premium if any and interest on debt securities is dividends from the bank there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by the bank to us as well as by us to our shareholders the corporation under tennessee corporate law we are not permitted to pay cash dividends if after giving effect to such payment we would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business or our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus any amounts needed to satisfy any preferential rights if we were dissolving in addition in deciding whether or not to declare a dividend of any particular size our board must consider our current and prospective capital liquidity and other needs including the needs of the bank which we are obligated to support the bank under tennessee corporate law the bank like the corporation discussed above may not pay a dividend if the bank would not be able to pay its debts when due or if the banks assets would be inadequate in a dissolution to pay liabilities and preferential rights similarly the banks board must consider current and prospective needs in making a decision to declare a dividend in addition in order to pay cash dividends the bank must obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve and the tdfi commissioner if the total of all dividends declared by the banks board of directors in any calendar year exceeds the total of i the banks retained net income for that year plus ii the banks retained net income for the preceding two years less certain required capital transfers as applicable below that ceiling approval generally is not required but see other factors affecting dividends immediately following this discussion applying the dividend restrictions imposed under applicable federal and state rules the banks total amount available for dividends without obtaining regulatory approval was table start form 10k annual report table end table start item business table end billion at january the application of those restrictions to the bank is discussed in more detail in the following sections all of which is incorporated into this item by reference under the caption liquidity risk management in our mda item beginning on page of this report and under the caption restrictions on dividends in note 12regulatory capital and restrictions of our financial statements item beginning on page other factors affecting dividends if in the opinion of the federal reserve we or the bank are engaged in or about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice which depending on the financial condition of fhn or the bank could include the payment of dividends the federal reserve may require us or the bank to cease and desist from that practice the federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institutions or holding companys capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice in addition under the federal deposit insurance act an fdicinsured depository institution such as the bank may not make any capital distributions pay any management fees to its holding company or pay any dividend if it is undercapitalized or if such payment would cause it to become undercapitalized the payment of cash dividends by us or by the bank also may be affected or limited by other factors such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines and requirements imposed by debt covenants for example as discussed under capital adequacy within this supervision and regulation discussion below our ability to pay dividends would be restricted if our capital ratios fell below minimum regulatory requirements plus a capital conservation buffer the federal reserve generally requires insured banks and bank holding companies to pay dividends only out of current operating earnings the federal reserve has released a supervisory letter advising among other things that a bank holding company should inform the federal reserve and should eliminate defer or significantly reduce its dividends if i the bank holding companys net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters net of dividends previously paid during that period is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends ii the bank holding companys prospective rate of earnings is not consistent with the bank holding companys capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition or iii the bank holding company will not meet or is in danger of not meeting its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios transactions with affiliates the banks ability to lend or extend credit to us or our other affiliates is restricted the bank and its subsidiaries generally may not extend credit to us or to any other affiliate of ours in an amount which exceeds of the banks capital stock and surplus and may not extend credit in the aggregate to us and all such affiliates in an amount which exceeds of the banks capital stock and surplus extensions of credit and other transactions between the bank and us or such other affiliates must be on terms and under circumstances including credit standards that are substantially the same or at least as favorable to the bank as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies further the type amount and quality of collateral which must secure such extensions of credit is regulated there are similar legal restrictions on the banks purchases of or investments in the securities of and purchases of assets from us or other affiliates the banks loans or extensions of credit to third parties

it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating institutions generally are not allowed to publicly disclose examination results an fdicinsured depository institution generally is prohibited from making any capital distribution including payment of dividends or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the federal reserve system in addition undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans an insured depository institutions holding company must guarantee the capital plan up to an amount equal to the lesser of of the depository institutions assets at the time it becomes undercapitalized or the amount of the capital deficiency when the institution fails to comply with the plan for the plan to be accepted by the applicable federal regulatory authority the federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining among other things that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institutions capital if a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan it is treated as if it were significantly undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks critically undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator generally within days of the date on which they become critically undercapitalized liquidity coverage ratio the liquidity coverage ratio or lcr refers to the amount of liquid assets cash cash equivalents or shortterm securities banks are required to keep on hand to meet a hypothetically projected total net cash outflow over a forwardlooking 30day period of stress the stressed outflow estimate is based a standard set of hypothetical assumptions set forth in regulatory requirements the lcr is designed to ensure banks hold a buffer of highquality liquid assets so that they can meet their shortterm liquidity needs and remain stable and strong in a stressed environment liquid assets generally provide low income levels compared to other investments so a higher lcr requirement can negatively impact a banks earnings the lcr requirement does not apply to institutions with assets of less than billion and so does not apply to us or the bank currently for larger institutions the minimum lcr requirement increases

of any subsidiary upon the latters liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiarys creditors including depositors in the case of the bank except to the extent that we may be a creditor with recognized claims against the subsidiary in addition depositors of a bank and the fdic as their subrogee would be entitled to priority over other creditors in the event of liquidation of the bank under federal reserve policy we are expected to act as a source of financial strength to and to commit resources to support the bank this support may be required at times even if absent such federal reserve policy we might not wish to provide it in addition any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank in the event of a bank holding companys bankruptcy any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment crossguarantee liability a depository institution insured by the fdic can be held liable for any loss incurred by or reasonably expected to be incurred by the fdic in connection with i the default of a commonly controlled fdicinsured depository institution or ii any assistance provided by the fdic to any commonly controlled fdicinsured depository institution in danger of default default is defined generally as the appointment of a conservator or receiver and in danger of default is defined generally as the existence of certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance the fdics claim for damages is superior to claims of shareholders of the insured depository institution or its holding company but is subordinate to claims of depositors secured creditors and holders of subordinated debt other than affiliates of the commonly controlled insured depository institution currently the bank is our only depository institution subsidiary if we were to own or operate another depository institution any loss suffered by the fdic in respect of one subsidiary bank would likely result in assertion of the crossguarantee provisions the assessment of estimated losses against our other subsidiary banks and a potential loss of our investment in our subsidiary banks interstate branching mergers as mentioned above the bank generally must have tdfis approval to establish a new banking center technically a branch for a new banking center located outside of tennessee tennessee law requires the bank to comply with branching laws applicable to the state where the new banking center will be located federal law allows the bank to establish or acquire a branch in another state to the same extent as a bank chartered in that other state would be allowed to establish or acquire a branch in tennessee for an interstate merger or acquisition the acquiring bank must be wellcapitalized and wellmanaged concentration limits on liabilities and deposits may not be exceeded regulators must assess the transaction for incremental systemic risk and the acquiring bank must have at least satisfactory standing under the federal community reinvestment act discussed immediately below moreover mergers and acquisitions that are large enough are subject to antitrust review and approval by the us department of justice once a bank has established branches in a state through de novo or acquired branching or through an interstate merger transaction the bank may then establish or acquire additional branches within that state to the same extent that a bank chartered in that state is allowed to establish or acquire branches within the state community reinvestment act cra the cra requires each us bank consistent with safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of each community where the bank accepts deposits including low and moderateincome lmi communities the federal reserve assesses the bank periodically for cra compliance and that assessment is made public the banks lmi operations and

federal law federal law generally allows financial holding companies broad authority to engage in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity these include insurance underwriting and brokerage merchant banking securities underwriting dealing and marketmaking real estate development and such additional activities as the federal reserve in consultation with the secretary of the treasury determines to be financial in nature or incidental a bank holding company may engage in these activities directly or through subsidiaries by qualifying as a financial holding company to qualify as a financial holding company a bank holding company must file an initial declaration with the federal reserve certifying that all of its subsidiary depository institutions are wellmanaged and wellcapitalized federal law also permits banks to engage in certain of these activities through financial subsidiaries to control or hold an interest in a financial subsidiary a bank must meet the following requirements the bank must receive approval from its primary federal regulator for the financial subsidiary to engage in the activities the bank and its depository institution affiliates must each be wellcapitalized and wellmanaged the aggregate consolidated total assets of all of the banks financial subsidiaries must not exceed the lesser of of the banks consolidated total assets or billion subject to indexing for inflation the bank must have in place adequate policies and procedures to identify and manage financial and operational risks and to preserve the separate identities and limited liability of the bank and the financial subsidiary if the bank is among the largest banks the bank must meet the creditworthiness or other criteria adopted by the federal reserve and the us secretary of the treasury from time to time if this fifth requirement ceases to be met after a bank controls or holds an interest in a financial subsidiary the bank cannot invest additional capital in that subsidiary until the requirement again is met no new activity may be commenced unless the bank and all of its depository institution affiliates have at least satisfactory cra ratings certain restrictions apply if the bank holding company or the bank fails to continue to meet one or more of the requirements listed above in addition federal law contains a number of other provisions that may affect the banks operations including limitations on the use and disclosure to third parties of client information at december we are a financial holding company and the bank has a number of financial subsidiaries as discussed in subsidiaries within this item under the other business information discussion which begins on page tennessee law tennessee law does not expressly

not prohibit but do tend to discourage lenders from originating nonqualified mortgages in a federal appellate court ruled that structural aspects related to the cfpbs creation in and operation were unconstitutional the court therefore invalidated a cfpb rule at issue in that case later a different appellate court in a separate case ruled the opposite way the question has been appealed to the us supreme court if the us supreme court affirms the first ruling the legal validity of cfpb rules and actions generally could be called into question data security portability security privacy federal law requires banks to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative technical and physical safeguards banks are required to have appropriate data governance practices and risk management processes as key functions supporting its operational resilience data privacy and protection increasingly is a significant legislative regulatory and societal concern the concern is driven by major technological and societal shifts in the past years led by relatively unregulated firms such as amazoncom alibaba facebook and google and their many clients worldwide those firms have gathered large amounts of personal details about millions of people and today have the ability to analyze that data and act on that analysis very quickly the firms seek to understand enough about a person to know what a person wants before the person does banks as mentioned above already are subject to significant privacy regulations probably for that reason the banking industry is not at the political center of these concerns currently even so banks are likely to be affected by broader legislative and regulatory responses to the perceived problems two prominent responses include the european union general data protection regulation and the california data privacy protection act neither is a banking industry regulation but both apply to banks in relation to certain clients and data to date neither has had a material impact on the bank portability client control federal law restricts the banks ability to share certain information with affiliates and nonaffiliates for marketing andor nonmarketing purposes or to contact clients with marketing offers affiliate and nonaffiliate sharing initiated by the bank generally is permitted with client consent increasingly banks are being required to permit enable and support client control of client data including the sharing of client data with bank affiliates and with outside organizations these requirements which still are evolving are intended to foster data portability for clients and greater competition among financial services firms however they also significantly increase data security risks because they create additional access channels for bad actors to try to exploit or they make accessing existing channels easier or faster fdic insurance assessments difa us bank deposits generally are insured by the deposit insurance fund dif administered by the fdic the system of fdic insurance premium rates charged consists of a rate grid structure in which base rates range from to basis points annually and in fully adjusted rates ranged from to basis points annually a basis point is equal to for the fdic implemented a temporary increase generally equal to basis points also for eight quarters starting in the fdic has imposed a special assessment of basis points per quarter intended to replenish the dif in the aftermath of three large regional bank failures that occurred in march and may of key factors in the grid include the institutions risk category i to iv whether the institution is deemed large and highly complex whether the institution qualifies for an unsecured debt adjustment and whether the institution is burdened with a brokered deposit adjustment other factors can impact the base against which the applicable rate is applied including for example whether a net loss is realized insurance of deposits may be terminated by the fdic upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law regulation rule order or condition imposed by a federal bank regulatory agency table start form 10k annual report table end table start item business table end depositor preference federal law provides that deposits and certain claims for administrative expenses and associate compensation against an insured depository institution would be afforded a priority over other general

of our subsidiaries are subject to various securities laws and regulations and capital adequacy requirements promulgated by the regulatory and exchange authorities of the jurisdictions in which they operate our registered brokerdealer subsidiaries are subject to the secs net capital rule rule 15c31 that rule requires the maintenance of minimum net capital and limits the ability of the

number of states insurance activities are subject to regulation by the states in which such business is transacted although most of such regulation focuses on insurance companies and their insurance products insurance agents and their activities are also subject to regulation by the states including among other things licensing and marketing and sales practices compensation risk management the federal reserve has issued guidance intended to ensure that incentive compensation arrangements at financial organizations take into account risk and are consistent with safe and sound practices the guidance is based on three key principles calling for incentive compensation plans to appropriately balance risks and rewards be compatible with effective controls and risk management and be backed up by strong corporate governance in response we operate an enhanced risk management process for assessing risk in incentive compensation plans several key incentive programs use a net profit approach rather than a revenuesonly approach and mandatory deferral features are used in several key programs including an executive program in federal agencies proposed rules which could significantly change the regulation of incentive compensation programs at financial institutions the proposal would create four tiers of institutions based on asset size institutions in the top two tiers would be subject to rules much more detailed and proscriptive than are currently in effect if interpreted aggressively by the regulators the proposed rules could be used to prevent as a practical matter larger institutions from engaging in certain lines of business where substantial commission and bonus pool arrangements are the norm in the proposal the top two tiers included institutions with more than billion of assets we and the bank currently would fall into the lower of those top two tiers however prompted by post2016 legislation which significantly raised several statutory assetsize tiers if this proposal were finalized today the billion floor might be raised allowing us to remain in the third tier we cannot predict what final rules may be adopted nor how they may be implemented effect of
