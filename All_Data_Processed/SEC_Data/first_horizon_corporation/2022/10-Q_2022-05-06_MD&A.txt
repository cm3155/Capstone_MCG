interest income net interest income is fhns largest source of revenue and is the difference between the interest earned on interestearning assets generally loans leases and investment securities and the interest expense incurred in connection with interestbearing liabilities generally deposits and borrowed funds the level of net interest income is primarily a function of the difference between the effective yield on average interestearning assets and the effective cost of interestbearing liabilities these factors are influenced by the pricing and mix of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities which in turn are impacted by external factors such as local economic conditions competition for loans and deposits the monetary policy of the frb and market interest rates

not consistent from period to period such as changes in unrecognized tax benefits the rate also may be affected by items resulting from business combinations a deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability is recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities the tax consequence is

valueatrisk and stress testing var is a statistical risk measure used to estimate the potential loss in value from adverse market movements over an assumed fixed holding period within a stated confidence level fhn employs a model to compute daily var measures for its trading securities inventory fhn computes var using historical simulation with a 1year lookback period at a confidence level with 1day and 10day time horizons additionally fhn computes a stressed var measure the svar computation uses the same model but with model inputs reflecting historical data from a continuous 12month period that reflects a period of significant financial stress appropriate for the trading securities portfolio a summary of fhns var and svar measures for 1day and 10day time horizons is presented in

actively manage the trading securities inventory continuously throughout each trading day accordingly fhnfs trading securities inventory is highly dynamic rather than static as a result it would be rare for fhnf to incur a negative revenue day in its fixed income activities at the levels indicated by its var measures in addition to being used in fhns daily market risk management process the var

points on the interest rate yield curve up bps assumes an instantaneous upward move in interest rates of basis points at all points on the interest rate yield curve curve flattening assumes an instantaneous flattening of the interest rate yield curve through an increase in shortterm rates and a decrease in longterm rates the 2year point on the treasury yield curve is assumed to increase basis points and the 10year point on the treasury yield curve is assumed to decrease basis points shifts in other points on the yield curve are predicted based on their correlation to the 2year and

outcomes of simulation analysis and rate shock analysis is forwardlooking actual results if the assumed scenarios were to occur could differ because of interest rate movements the ability of management to execute its business plans and other factors including those presented in the forwardlooking statements section of this report management uses a simulation model to measure interest rate risk and to formulate strategies to improve balance sheet positioning earnings or both within fhns interest rate risk liquidity and capital guidelines interest rate exposure is measured by forecasting months of nii under various interest rate scenarios and comparing the percentage change in nii for each scenario to a base case scenario where interest rates remain unchanged assumptions are made regarding future balance sheet composition interest rate movements and loan and deposit pricing in addition assumptions are made about the magnitude of asset prepayments and earlier than anticipated deposit withdrawals the results of these scenarios help fhn develop strategies for managing exposure to interest rate risk while management believes the assumptions used and scenarios selected in its simulations are reasonable simulation modeling provides only an estimate not a precise calculation of exposure to any given change in interest rates based on a static balance sheet as of march nii

by several known trends key among those are changes in the us and global economy and outlook government actions affecting interest rates government actions intended to stimulate the economy and government actions and proposals which could have negative impacts on the economy at large or on certain businesses additional risks relate to how the covid19 pandemic continues to affect fhns clients political uncertainty changes in federal policies including those publicly discussed formally proposed or recently implemented and the potential impacts of those changes on our businesses and clients and whether fhns strategic initiatives will succeed inflation recession and federal reserve policy in march in response to the economic downturn associated with the covid19 pandemic along with societal and government reactions to it the federal reserve eased by lowering shortterm interest rates and starting an asset purchase program intended to lower longerterm interest rates and foster access to credit the effective yields of 10year and 30year us treasury securities achieved record low rates these changes in interest rates and the volatility in the market negatively impacted fhns net interest margin amortization of net processing fees related to government relief programs associated with the covid19 pandemic including the paycheck protection program offset a portion of the net interest margin decline during easing policy continued interest rates fluctuated but remained very low continuing to adversely impact fhns net interest margin inflation in the us rose significantly during but was viewed as transitory driven by temporary supplychain shortages coupled with strong demand as unemployment fell while government cash transfers to broad sections of the public continued in to date with the economic effects of the pandemic receding and inflation continuing strongly the federal reserve reversed its easing policy by reducing tapering its asset purchases and starting to increase shortterm interest rates the federal reserves most recent public comments indicate that asset purchases will stop shortly the federal reserves holdings of assets will be reduced through attrition and shortterm rates are expected to be raised several more times during the federal reserve has not indicated that it intends to sell assets to reduce its holdings more quickly but it could decide to take such action later in any case these actions are intended to increase both short and longterm interest rates quickly the primary driver of this change in viewpoint is the persistence and strength of inflation in the us until first quarter there had been no reported quarterly contraction in the us economy since the first quarter contraction was mild annualized if contraction persists in the second quarter the us technically would be in recession the risk of recession or an actual recessionary situation may affect future actions by the federal reserve since raising interest rates tends to slow the economy and increase recession risk during this stillongoing transitional period the yield curve has flattened and modestly inverted at times for example overnight rates were higher than one and twomonth rates unusual yield curve effects including inversion may continue a traditional measure of inversionwhen the twoyear rate is higher than the tenyear rate for a sustained period of timehas not yet occurred though several brief inversions occurred in march and april this year traditional yield curve inversion is viewed with statistical support as a harbinger of economic recession as a result of recession risk coupled with the uncertainties associated with the war in eastern europe financial markets worldwide have been volatile in with in many asset classes and business sectors generally lower valuations currently than at yearend fhn cannot predict exactly when or how much shortterm rates will be raised nor how marketdriven longterm rates will behave nor how those actions may affect financial markets during the remainder of though rates have risen this year they continue to remain low by historical standards in several respects fhn is likely to benefit from rising rates as long as the rise in lending rates outpaces the inevitable rise in deposit and other funding rates one area however already has been hurt the general increase in interest rates in has pushed home mortgage rates in the us higher fhns direct mortgage lending lending to mortgage companies and title insurance activities have seen business decline in part of that decline likely is seasonal as first quarter often is weaker than the warmer months in the us but part likely is driven by higher rates coupled with stillhigh property valuations in many us markets if mortgage rates continue to rise fhns revenues and earnings from 1q22 form 10q report part i item managements discussion analysis mda those areas likely will continue to be muted compared with war in eastern europe in late february the russian military invaded ukraine russian forces occupied ukrainian territory and cities some of which have since been liberated by ukrainian forces much of europe and the rest of the world including the us has imposed economic sanctions on russia for its attack its ongoing military campaign resulting in substantial civilian casualties and the manner in which it has prosecuted the war which reportedly has significantly violated several international conventions and treaties the war and sanctions resulted in global oil and gas prices rising precipitously in along with the prices of several other commodities exported by russia ukraine or both including grains and vegetable oils these effects likely have contributed significantly to a change in the federal reserves views of inflation in the us and to fears of a possible economic recession all discussed in inflation recession and federal reserve policy immediately above also several us and european multinational companies have pulled operations and assets out of russia and parts of ukraine compounding the economic impact of the war on the global economy covid19 pandemic the covid19 pandemic caused extraordinary disruption in that negatively impacted the economy and business activity especially lending other than lending related to home mortgages during and thus far in fhn saw the lending pipeline improve in several areas unrelated to home mortgages as covid19 restrictions were partially or fully eased in most of fhns markets despite variants of the covid19 virus triggering reinstatement of some restrictions in some markets broadly speaking fhn expects the impact of covid19 restrictions in its markets to continue to diminish over the rest of this year however the risk of resurgence remains in late march the pandemic began a resurgence in parts of china prompting the chinese government to lock down shanghai chinas most populous city and a major international seaport the lockdown has not yet significantly impacted the global economy but soon could if it continues illustrating how covid resurgence outside of the us can affect the us and fhn libor reference rate reform libor the london interbank offered rate libor for many years was the most widely used reference rate in the world a large but declining portion of fhns floating rate loans use libor denominated in us dollars usd as the reference rate to determine the interest rate paid by the clientborrower in addition certain floatingrate securities issued by fhn use usd libor as the reference rate libor is based on a mix of transactionbased data and expert judgment about market conditions it is published in different tenors which are time periods such as 1week 1month 12month etc libor discontinuance about a decade ago evidence emerged that some members of the panel that set libor may have manipulated the published libor rates rather than using strictly goodfaith judgments several banks were fined in the chief executive of the united kingdom financial conduct authority the fcathe governmental regulator of liborannounced that it intended to halt persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after in the fca announced that tenors of usd libor would no longer be published as follows one week and 2month usd libor would not be published after december and all other usd libor tenors eg overnight 1month 3month 6month and 12month tenors would not be published after june us regulatory position in the federal reserve the occ and the fdic jointly encouraged us banks to transition away from libor for new contracts as soon as practicable and in any event by december they noted that entering into new contracts that use libor as a reference rate after december would create safety and soundness risks alternatives to libor libor became the marketpreferred reference rate because it was perceived by lenders and borrowers as being superior to alternatives in a wide range of circumstancesnow that the origination of liborindexed 1q22 form 10q report part i item managements discussion analysis mda loans has ended no single alternative reference rate has replaced libor for usd transactions instead a number of different reference rates are being used in different circumstances these include sofr the alternative reference rates committee arrc is a group of

reference rate the arrc has recommended the secured overnight financing rate sofr as its preferred alternative sofr resets daily and is based on actual transaction data for the us treasury repurchase market accordingly sofr represents a riskless secured overnight rate cme term sofr published by cme group term sofr is a forwardlooking rate with 1month 3month and 6month tenors and is based on sofr

traditional prime rates with each bank setting its own are not likely to regain the prominence they had decades ago when us banks were much smaller and the industry was more fragmented for some clients and products banks may increase their usage of prime rates the alternatives listed above were made available to the majority of fhns commercial clients starting in november in accordance with the us regulatory position fhn ceased entering into new libor based contracts as of december other alternative reference rates are being developed and fhn may consider them at a future time each alternative reference rate has advantages and disadvantages compared with other alternatives in various circumstances despite being supported by the federal reserves arrc sofr may not gain the level of market acceptance and usage that usd libor enjoyed within the us key aspects of sofr that support this view are a sofr fundamentally is an overnight rate and so is not easily or reliably translated into typical libor tenors and b sofr is both secured and riskless and so does not necessarily track a banks cost of funds very well for a bank it is critical to avoid significant mismatches over time between its variable cost of funds and its variable interest income term sofr attempts to address some of these shortcomings but not all of them all of the alternative reference rates selected by fhn to date meet the international organization of securities commissions iosco principles for financial benchmarks as affirmed by the rate administrator andor an independent auditor while banking regulators have stated that banks are free to choose the index rates they offer clients some public sector officials have urged caution in using the new credit sensitive alternative reference rates primarily due to the robustness of underlying data used to derive the rates more specifically there is concern of an inverted pyramid effect where a large number of financial contracts could be priced using an index derived from a relatively low volume of transactions in an interagency statement on october us banking regulatory agencies noted that supervised institutions should understand how their chosen reference rate is constructed and be aware of any fragilities associated with that rate and the markets that underlie it iosco has also warned of the potential for the inverted pyramid problem and will monitor how the iosco label is used by administrators fhn is monitoring the credit sensitive reference rates and regulatory guidance around use of such rates fhn plans to limit use of credit sensitive rates to commercial loans approximately of global usd libor market and related customer swaps pending development of derivatives markets for these rates additionally fhn expects that each financial contract will contain fallback language to guide transition from a credit sensitive rate to an alternative should that action be deemed necessary in the future fhns actions to date transition plans starting in fhn modernized the fallback language used in its loan documentation to better handle how floating rate loans would be reset if libor ceased to be published during the loan
