item risk factors this item outlines specific risks that could affect the ability of our various businesses to compete change our risk profile or materially impact our operating results or financial condition our operating environment continues to evolve and new risks continue to emerge to address that challenge we have a risk management governance structure that oversees processes for monitoring evolving risks and oversees various initiatives designed to manage and control our potential exposure this item highlights risks that could impact us in material ways by causing future results to differ materially from past results by causing future results to differ materially from current expectations or by causing material changes in our financial condition in this item we have outlined risks that we believe are important to us at the present time however other risks may prove to be important in the future and new risks may emerge at any time we cannot predict all potential

may subsequent to the extension td recently informed fhn that td does not expect that the necessary regulatory approvals will be received in time to complete the pending td merger by may and that td cannot provide a new projected closing date at this time if the pending td merger does not close by may then an amendment to the merger agreement will be required to further extend the outside termination date td has initiated discussions with fhn regarding a potential further extension of the outside date there can be no assurance that an extension will ultimately be agreed or that td will satisfy all regulatory requirements so that the regulatory approvals required to complete the pending td merger will be received regulatory approvals may not be received have taken longer than expected and may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated before the pending td merger may be completed various approvals consents and nonobjections must be obtained from the federal reserve the office of the comptroller of the currency tds primary federal banking regulator and various other regulatory antitrust and other authorities in the united states and canada in determining whether to grant these approvals such regulatory authorities consider a variety of factors including the regulatory standing of each party these approvals have taken longer to receive than originally anticipated and could be further delayed or not obtained at all including due to an adverse development in either partys regulatory standing or in any other factors considered by regulators when granting such approvals governmental political or community group inquiries table start form 10k annual report table end table start item risk factors table end investigations or opposition or changes in legislation or the political environment generally the federal reserve has stated that if material weaknesses are identified by examiners before a banking organization applies to engage in expansionary activity the federal reserve will expect the banking organization to resolve all such weaknesses before applying for such expansionary activity the federal reserve has also stated that if issues arise during the processing of an application for expansionary activity it will expect the applicant banking organization to withdraw its application pending resolution of any supervisory concerns the approvals that are granted may impose terms and conditions limitations obligations or costs or may place restrictions on the conduct of the combined companys business or may require changes to the terms of the transactions contemplated by the td merger agreement and related bank merger agreement regulators may impose such conditions limitations obligations or restrictions and if imposed such conditions limitations obligations or restrictions may have the effect of delaying the completion of any of the transactions contemplated by the td merger agreement and bank merger agreement imposing additional material costs on us in addition such conditions terms obligations or restrictions if imposed may result in the delay or abandonment of the pending td merger additionally the completion of the pending td merger is conditioned on the absence of certain orders injunctions or decrees by any court or regulatory agency of competent jurisdiction that would prohibit or make illegal the completion of any of the transactions contemplated by the td merger agreement and related bank merger agreement there can be no assurance that regulators will not impose such conditions limitations obligations or other restrictions in addition despite each partys commitment to use its reasonable best efforts to comply with conditions imposed by regulators under the terms of td merger agreement and related bank merger agreement neither we nor td will be required and neither party will be permitted without the prior written consent of the other party to take actions or agree to conditions that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the combined company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole after giving effect to the mergers the td merger agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the pending td merger may not be completed the td merger agreement is subject to a number of conditions which must be fulfilled in order to complete the pending td merger those conditions include i the approval of the pending td merger by the requisite vote of our shareholders ii the receipt of all required regulatory approvals which are necessary to close the pending td merger and the expiration of all statutory waiting periods without the imposition of any materially burdensome regulatory condition iii the absence of any order injunction decree or other legal restraint preventing the completion of the pending td merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the td merger agreement or by the related bank merger agreement or

qualification and v the prior performance in all material respects by each party of the obligations required to be performed by it at or prior to the closing date the requisite vote described in i above was received on may the conditions to the closing may not be fulfilled in a timely manner or at all and accordingly the pending td merger might not be completed in addition the parties can mutually decide to terminate td merger agreement at any time for additional information concerning the need to meet all conditions to closing the pending td merger and the risk of termination see the first paragraph above under risks related to the pending td merger within this item failure to complete the pending td merger could negatively impact our stock price result in litigation and result in significant dilution due to the terms of the series g preferred stock issued to td if the pending td merger is not completed for any reason including as a result of failure to obtain all needed regulatory approvals there may be various adverse consequences and we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from our clients and associates for example our business may be impacted adversely by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the pending td merger additionally if the td merger agreement is terminated or there is a significant further delay in the receipt of the regulatory approvals required to complete the pending transaction the market price of our common stock could decline after announcement of the pending td merger on february the market price of our common stock increased markedly to reflect the consideration to be paid under the td merger agreement termination of the pending td merger or the markets

resulting from such conversion we also could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the pending td merger or to proceedings commenced against us to perform our obligations under the td merger agreement if the td merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances we may be required to pay to td a termination fee of up to million we have incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial expenses in connection with the completion of the transactions contemplated by the td merger agreement and related bank merger agreement if the pending td merger is not completed we would have paid a large portion of these expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the pending td merger the pending td merger including the need to further extend the td merger agreement outside date may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations uncertainty about the effect of the pending td merger on our associates clients and other parties has had an adverse effect on our business and results of operations in and may have an ongoing adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations regardless of whether the pending td merger is completed these risks to our business include among others the following all of which may be exacerbated by the current delay in the completion of the pending td merger the impairment of our ability to attract retain and motivate our associates especially highperforming associates approached by competitors the diversion of significant management time and attention from ongoing business operations towards the completion of the pending td merger difficulties maintaining relationships with clients suppliers and other business partners delays or deferments of certain business decisions by our clients suppliers and other business partners the inability to pursue alternative business opportunities or make appropriate changes to our business because the td merger agreement requires us to subject to certain exceptions conduct its business in the ordinary course of business and to not engage in certain kinds of transactions prior to the completion of the pending td merger without the prior written consent of td such consent not to be unreasonably conditioned withheld or delayed even if such actions could prove beneficial potential litigation relating to the pending td merger and the costs and uncertainties related thereto and the incurrence of significant unexpected costs expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the pending td merger since announcement of the pending td merger we have experienced many of these impacts though none has been material to date although impacts from the last itemmerger preparation expensesare unavoidable and were a significant notable item impacting our earnings unexpected expenses have not been significant to date although each of the other items in this list has the potential to become significant we believe the most significant to date and the one with the most adverse potential as the transaction continues to be delayed is the first itemcompetitors poaching highperforming associates in we put a retention award program in place that we believe has been reasonably effective to date but associate loss has occurred and we believe the risk of significant associate loss will grow as delay continues shareholder litigation could prevent or delay the completion of the pending td merger or otherwise negatively impact our business and operations one or more of our shareholders may file new lawsuits against us andor our directors and officers in connection with the pending td merger as previously disclosed eleven shareholder suits were filed in but have since been dismissed and none have materially impacted the pending td merger one of the conditions to the closing is that no order injunction or decree issued by any court or governmental entity of competent jurisdiction or other legal restraint preventing the consummation of the pending td merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the td merger agreement and related bank merger agreement be in effect if any plaintiff were successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting us from completing the pending td merger then such injunction may delay or prevent the effectiveness of the pending td merger and could result in significant costs to us including any cost associated with the indemnification of directors and officers of each company if a new lawsuit is filed we may incur costs in connection with the defense or settlement of any shareholder lawsuits filed in connection table start form 10k annual report table end table start item risk factors table end with the pending td merger such litigation could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could prevent or delay the completion of the pending td merger the td merger agreement contains provisions that could discourage a potential competing acquirer that might be willing to pay more to acquire or merge with us the td merger agreement contains provisions that restrict our ability to among other things initiate solicit knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals with respect to or subject to certain exceptions generally related to the exercise of fiduciary duties by our board of directors engage in any negotiations concerning or provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data relating to any alternative acquisition proposals these provisions which include a termination fee of up to million payable by us under certain circumstances might discourage a potential competing acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of us from considering or proposing that acquisition even if in the case of a potential acquisition of us it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share price to our shareholders than what is contemplated in the pending td merger or might result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower per share price to acquire us than it might otherwise have proposed to pay traditional competition risks we are subject to intense competition for clients and the nature of that competition is changing quickly our primary areas of competition include consumer and commercial deposits commercial loans consumer loans including home mortgages and lines of credit financial planning and wealth management fixed income products and services and other consumer and commercial financial products and services our competitors in these areas include national state and nonus banks savings and loan associations credit unions consumer finance companies trust companies investment counseling firms money market and other mutual funds insurance companies and agencies securities firms mortgage banking companies hedge funds and other financial services companies that serve in our markets the emergence of nontraditional disruptive service providers see industry disruption within this item beginning on page has intensified the competitive environment some competitors are traditional banks subject to the same regulatory framework as we are while others are not banks and in many cases experience a significantly different or reduced degree of regulation examples of lessregulated activities include checkcashing services independent atm services and peertopeer lending where investors provide debt financing or other capital directly to borrowers competitive pressures shift with the business and rate environment over much of and with deposits relatively abundant the competitive focus on lending and feebased services was relatively high with rising rates and the cessation of pandemic relief funds obtaining and maintaining deposits has become more significant we expect that competition will continue to grow more intense with respect to most of our products and services heightened competition tends to put downward pressure on revenues from affected items upward pressure on marketing and other promotional costs or both for additional information regarding competition for clients refer to competition within item beginning on page of this report we compete for talent our most significant competitors for clients also tend to be our most significant competitors for top talent see operational risks below within this item for additional information concerning this risk we compete to raise capital in the equity and debt markets see liquidity and funding risks beginning on page of this item for additional information concerning this risk traditional strategic macro risks we may be unable to successfully implement our strategy to operate and grow our regional and specialty banking businesses although our current strategy is expected to evolve as business conditions change in our primary strategies are to invest resources in our banking businesses seek to exploit growth opportunities especially within the markets we serve and seek to exploit opportunities to cut cost without significant revenue impact organic growth is expected to be coordinated with a focus on strong and stable returns on capital organically over the past several years we enhanced our market share in our regional banking markets with targeted hires and marketing and we invested resources in specialty commercial lending and private client banking after the completion of the ibkc merger in we started to invest significantly in new platforms and processes to modernize legacy operations provide a table start form 10k annual report table end table start item risk factors table end better client experience reduce ongoing operating costs and support future growth of the combined franchise we expect investments of that sort to continue in consistent with limitations imposed by the td merger agreement investments of that sort have been expensive in the near term although we believe they are necessary for our future and are appropriate for our company at this time the financial returns on these investments are highly uncertain in the future more generally we expect to continue to nurture profitable organic growth we may pursue acquisitions or strategic transactions if appropriate opportunities within or outside of our current markets present themselves the td merger agreement restricts us from making certain acquisitions and taking other specified actions without the consent of td and requires us to operate in the ordinary course of business these restrictions may prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the pending td merger or may otherwise adversely affect our ongoing business and operations see risks related to the pending td merger beginning on page for a discussion of additional risks related to the pending td merger failure to achieve one or more key elements needed for successful organic growth would adversely affect our business and earnings we believe that the successful execution of organic growth depends upon a number of key elements including our ability to attract and retain clients in our banking market areas our ability to achieve and maintain growth in our earnings while pursuing new business opportunities our ability to maintain a high level of client service while optimizing our physical banking center count due to changing client demand all while expanding our remote banking services and expanding or enhancing our information processing technology compliance and other operational infrastructures effectively and efficiently our ability to manage the liquidity and capital requirements associated with growth especially organic growth and cashfunded acquisitions and our ability to manage effectively and efficiently the changes and adaptations necessitated by a complex burdensome and evolving regulatory environment we have in place strategies designed to achieve those elements that are significant to us at present our challenge is to execute those strategies and adjust them or adopt new strategies as conditions change a type of strategic acquisitiona socalled merger of equals where the company we nominally acquire has similar size operating contribution or valuepresents unique opportunities but also unique risks those special risks include the potential for elevated and duplicative operating expenses if we are unable to integrate the two companies efficiently in a reasonable amount of time and the potential for a significant increase in the time horizon that may be needed before substantial economies of scale can be realized or substantial revenue synergies can be developed effectively the ibkc merger presented those risks in fact the completion of systems integration was delayed several months resulting in increased integration expense although the proximate reason for the delay was a hurricane event impacting key markets the length of the delay likely would have been less if we had merely been integrating a small banks systems with ours industry disruption through technological innovations and changes in client habits the manner in which clients use financial services continues to change at a rapid pace we provide a large number of services remotely online and mobile and physical banking center utilization has been in longterm decline throughout the industry for many years technology has helped us reduce costs and improve service but also has weakened traditional geographic and relationship ties and has allowed disruptors to enter traditional banking areas through digital marketing and service platforms many banks are making client inroads unrelated to physical presence this competitive risk is especially pronounced from the largest us banks and from onlineonly banks due in part to the investments they are able to sustain in their digital platforms companies as disparate as paypal an online payment clearinghouse and starbucks a large chain of cafes provide payment and exchange services which compete directly with banks in ways not possible traditionally the nature of technologydriven disruption to our industry is changing in some cases seeking to displace traditional financial service providers rather than merely enhance traditional services or their delivery a number of recent technologies have worked with the existing financial system and traditional banks such as the evolution of atm cards into debitcredit cards and the evolution of debitcredit cards into smart phones these sorts of technologies often have expanded the market for table start form 10k annual report table end table start item risk factors table end banking services overall while siphoning a portion of the revenues from those services away from banks and disrupting prior methods of delivering those services but some recent innovations may tend to replace traditional banks as financial service providers rather than merely augment those services for example companies which claim to offer applications and services based on artificial intelligence compete much more directly with traditional financial services companies in areas involving personal advice including highmargin services such as financial planning and wealth management the lowcost highspeed nature of these roboadvisor services can be especially attractive to younger lessaffluent clients and potential clients as well as persons interested in selfservice investment management other industry changes such as zerocommission securities trading offered by certain large firms may amplify this trend similarly inventions based on blockchain technology eventually may be the foundation for greatly enhancing transactional security throughout the banking industry but also eventually may decentralize financial services reducing the demand for banks as secure depositkeepers and financial intermediaries we believe that over the course of the technologydriven evolution of our industry which is well underway the winners will be those institutions which can know their clients and make those clients feel they are known even when many clients increasingly do not visit banking centers or have facetoface live interaction two keys to achieving a psychological connection with such clients are data management and analytics using artificial intelligence processes which allow an institution to provide a differentiated personalized experience for the client at the point of interaction and seamless integration of realtime client contact with a human being through voice chat or other means a critical factor in successful data analytics allowing realtime differentiated interaction with clients is how traditionally uncaptured unstructured or siloed data is acquired managed and accessed while many banks are attempting to address this business need in various ways it remains unclear which approaches will be successful in the long run in addition external vendors are developing processes to provide solutions a basic challenge for all these efforts is how to integrate analysis of extremely disparate forms of data and utilize that analysis in each client contact in a manner which most clients not only accept but value developing workable proprietary solutions to the data analytics challenges ahead of competitors requires substantial investment in information technology systems and innovation even with a substantial it budget we cannot outspend or even come close to matching the largest us banking institutions therefore like most us banks our strategy must be focused on leveraging products and solutions which are within our means including those developed by external vendors our goal must be to keep pace with industry developments with a focus on improving the clients differentiated experience with us by recognizing and responding to client needs technological innovation has tended to reduce barriers to entry based on cost put another way once someone finds a new better method to accomplish a task in our industry often others are able to replicate or improve on that method sometimes quite rapidly key risks for us therefore are whether we will be able to catch up to breakthroughs quickly enough to avoid client attrition to adopt and enhance breakthroughs frequently enough and without significant technical failures to attract clients from competitors and if we are able to truly innovate to press our advantage quickly before competitors adopt it to thrive as our industry is disrupted we will need to continue to embrace some of the attitudes of a technology company and shed some of the traditional attitudes often associated with banking this has required and will continue to require an evolution in our corporate culture which in turn creates implementation risk in this evolutionary process it is critical that we not lose sight of how our clients experience working with us and our systems including those clients who still want traditionallydelivered services those who seek and embrace the latest innovations and those who just want services to be convenient personalized and understandable just as disruptive business changes driven by new technologies and new client preferences can adversely impact us and our entire industry similar events can adversely impact our commercial clients in time a major business disruption can cause dominant businesses to fail and can shrink or even end entire lines of business an example of this is the business failure of the blockbuster video distribution chain and most other video distribution stores and the rise of netflix and similar services many other examples of this kind of process are ongoing today in many industries including publishing retail sales news and the creation as well as distribution of audio and video entertainment to the extent disruptions impact our clients we may experience elevated loan losses and loss of ongoing business which we may not be able to recapture with new clients table start form 10k annual report table end table start item risk factors table end operational risks fraud is a major and increasing operational risk for us and all banks two traditional areasdeposit fraud check forging check kiting wire fraud etc and loan fraudcontinue to be major sources of fraud attempts and actual loss the methods used to perpetrate and combat fraud continue to evolve as technology changes in addition to cybersecurity risk discussed below new technologies have made it easier for bad actors to obtain and use client personal information mimic communications and signatures and otherwise create false instructions and documents that appear genuine our antifraud actions are both preventive anticipating lines of attack educating associates and clients etc and responsive detecting halting and remediating actual attacks our regulators require us to report actual and suspected fraud promptly and regulators often advise banks of new schemes so that the entire industry can adapt as quickly as possible however some level of fraud loss is unavoidable and the risk of a major loss cannot be eliminated our ability to conduct and grow our businesses is dependent in part upon our ability to create maintain expand and evolve an appropriate operational and organizational infrastructure manage expenses and recruit and retain personnel with the ability to manage a complex business operational risk can arise in many ways including errors related to failed or inadequate physical operational information technology or other processes faulty or disabled computer or other technology systems fraud theft physical security breaches electronic data and related security breaches or other criminal conduct by associates or third parties and exposure to other external events inadequacies may present themselves in myriad ways actions taken to manage one risk may be ineffective against others for example information technology systems may be insufficiently redundant to withstand a fire incursion malware or other major casualty and they may be insufficiently adaptable to new business conditions or opportunities efforts to make systems more robust may make them less adaptable and viceversa also our efforts to control expenses which is a significant priority for us increases our operational challenges as we strive to maintain client service and compliance at high quality and low cost an information technology security cybersecurity breach or other incident can cause significant damage and can be difficult to detect even after it occurs among other things that damage can occur due to outright theft loss or extortion of our funds or our clients funds fraud or identity theft perpetrated on clients loss of confidential or proprietary information business disruption or adverse publicity associated with a breach or incident and its potential effects perpetrators potentially can be associates clients and certain vendors all of whom legitimately have access to some portion of our systems as well as outsiders with no legitimate access cybersecurity incidents happen frequently they are an unavoidable part of doing business often but not always we detect and block the attempt often but not always the number of clients impacted is modest and our loss is minimal or none however even with significant loss prevention and mitigation systems the risk of a financially or reputationally significant incursion cannot be eliminated given the high volume of daily transactions in modern banking the question is not whether we will experience a significant and costly incursion but when for that reason the key goals of our processes are block or prevent as many incursions as is practical and detectmitigate rapidly those that get through the difference between a minor and a major incursion often comes down to how quickly it is detected and countered common categories of cybersecurity incidents relevant to us as a bank include account takeover client spoofing and payment fraud ransomware and other malware client interface attacks attempts to shut down or slow down our website or mobile app and cloud remote server incursions common vulnerabilities include clients and associates that fall victim to malicious emails or other communications and inappropriately share credentials allowing access to accounts or systems older software or systems that do not have uptodate security and are not sufficiently isolated from other systems thirdparty software vulnerabilities and thirdparty systems vulnerabilities we believe the bad actors have a range of motivations including illegal profit politically or geopolitically motivated disruption and vandalism bad actors can range from amateurs to criminal organizations to nationstates because of the potential for very serious consequences associated with these risks our electronic systems and their upgrades need to address internal and external security concerns to a high degree and our systems must comply with applicable banking and other regulations pertaining to bank safety and client protection although many of our defenses are systemic and highly technical others are much older and more basic for example periodically we train all our associates to recognize red flags associated with fraud theft and other electronic crimes and we educate our clients as well through regular and episodic securityoriented communications we expect our systems and regulatory requirements will continue to evolve as technology and criminal techniques also continue to evolve the operational functions we outsource to third parties may experience similar disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited control table start form 10k annual report table end table start item risk factors table end and in some cases limited ability to obtain an alternate vendor quickly to the extent we rely on third party vendors to perform or assist operational functions the challenge of managing the associated risks may become more difficult we manage this risk by assessing the adequacy of cybersecurity prevention and detection systems and programs of critical vendors the operational functions of business counterparties or businesses with which we have no relationship may experience disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited or no control although these events cannot be predicted individually over time and in the aggregate they happen as surely as loan losses for example when a major us consumeroriented firm experiences a data systems incursion resulting in the theft of credit and debit card information online account information and other data it impacts thousands or sometimes millions of people frequently many of those affected are our clients although our systems are not breached by these thirdparty incursions they can increase account fraud and can cause us to take costly steps to avoid significant theft loss to our bank and our clients our ability to recoup our losses may be limited legally or practically in many situations possible points of incursion or disruption not within our control include retailers utilities insurers health care service providers internet service and electronic mail providers social media portals distantserver cloud service providers electronic data security providers telecommunications companies and smart phone manufacturers failure to build and maintain or outsource the necessary operational infrastructure failure of that infrastructure to perform its functions or failure of our disaster preparedness plans if primary infrastructure components suffer damage can lead to risk of loss of service to clients legal actions and noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards additional information concerning operational risks and our management of them all of which is incorporated into this item by this reference appears under the caption operational risk management beginning on page of our mda item the delivery of financial services to clients and others increasingly depends upon technologies systems and multiparty infrastructures which are new creating or enhancing several risks discussed elsewhere examples of the risks created or enhanced by the widespread and rapid adoption of relatively untested technologies include security incursions operational malfunctions or other disruptions and legal claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement competition for talent is substantial and increasing moreover revenue growth in some business lines increasingly depends upon top talent in recent years the cost to us of hiring and retaining top revenueproducing talent has increased and that trend is likely to continue the primary tools we use to attract and retain talent are salaries commission incentive and retention compensation programs retirement benefits change in control severance benefits health and other welfare benefits and our corporate culture to the extent we are unable to use these tools effectively we face the risk that over time our best talent will leave us and we will be unable to replace those persons effectively incentives might operate poorly or have unintended adverse effects incentive programs are difficult to design well and even if welldesigned often they must be updated to address changes in our business a poorly designed incentive programwhere goals are too difficult too easy or not well related to desired outcomescould provide little useful motivation to key associates could increase turnover and could impact client retention moreover even where those pitfalls are avoided incentive programs may create unintended adverse consequences for example a program focused entirely on revenue production without proper controls may result in costs growing faster than revenues we face the risk that our competitors may seek to use the pending td merger to target our clients and top talent see risks related to the pending td merger beginning on page for a discussion of additional risks related to the pending td merger risks from economic downturns changes generally in an economic downturn our realized credit losses increase demand for our products and services declines and the credit quality of our loan portfolio declines delinquencies and realized credit losses generally increase during economic downturns due to an increase in liquidity problems for clients and downward pressure on collateral values likewise demand for loans at a given level of creditworthiness deposit and other products and financial services may decline during an economic downturn and may be adversely affected by other national regional or local economic factors that impact demand for loans and other financial products and services such factors include for example changes in employment rates interest rates real estate prices or expectations concerning rates or prices accordingly an economic downturn or other adverse economic change local regional national or global can hurt our financial performance in the form of higher loan losses lower loan production levels lower deposit levels compression of our net interest margin and lower fees from transactions and services those effects can continue for many years after the downturn technically ends table start form 10k annual report table end table start item risk factors table end because all banks are sensitive to the risk of downturns the stock prices of all banks typically decline sometimes substantially if the market believes that a downturn has become more likely or is imminent this effect can and often does occur indiscriminately initially without much regard to different risk postures of different banks risks associated with monetary events in recent years the federal reserve has implemented and reversed significant economic strategies that have impacted interest rates inflation asset values and the shape of the yield curve these strategies have had and will continue to have a significant impact on our business and on many of our clients to illustrate in response to the recession in and the following uneven recovery the federal reserve implemented a series of domestic monetary initiatives designed to lower rates and make credit easier to obtain the federal reserve changed course in raising rates several times through the last raise in was accompanied by a substantial and broad stock market decline in the federal reserve began to lower rates in in response to economic disruption associated with the covid19 pandemic the federal reserve quickly reduced shortterm rates to extremely low levels and acted to influence the markets to reduce longterm rates as well during the federal reserve significantly reduced its easing actions that held down longterm rates during the federal reserve switched to a tightening policy it raised short term rates significantly and rapidly over most of the year those actions triggered a significant decline in the values of most categories of us stocks and bonds significantly raised recessionary expectations for the us and inverted the yield curve in the us for much of the last two quarters of for the federal reserve has not yet indicated when it will stop or at least pause raising short term rates although the rate of increases has slowed additional information concerning monetary policy risks is presented under the caption cyclicality within the other business information section of item which starts on page within the effect of governmental policies and proposals section of item beginning on page in interest rate and yield curve risks beginning on page and under the caption federal reserve policy in transition within the market uncertainties and prospective trends section of our mda item beginning on page federal reserve strategies can and often are intended to affect the domestic money supply inflation interest rates and the shape of the yield curve effects on the yield curve often are most pronounced at the short end of the curve which is of particular importance to us and other banks among other things easing strategies are intended to lower interest rates encourage borrowing expand the money supply and stimulate economic activity while tightening strategies are intended to increase interest rates discourage borrowing tighten the money supply and restrain economic activity however as noted above in short term rates rose faster than long term rates to the point that the yield curve inverted for much of the final two quarters of the year this sort of phenomenonwhere short term rates are raised more strongly and rapidly than longterm rates can followis relatively common it is not clear when long term rates are likely to catch up many external factors may interfere with the effects of the federal reserves plans or cause them to be changed perhaps quickly such factors include significant economic trends or events as well as significant international monetary policies and events such strategies also can affect the us and worldwide financial systems in ways that may be difficult to predict risks associated with interest rates and the yield curve are discussed in this item under the caption interest rate and yield curve risks beginning on page we may be adversely affected by economic and political situations outside the us the us economy and the businesses of many of our clients are linked significantly to economic and market conditions outside the us especially in north and central america europe and asia and increasingly in south america although our direct exposure to nonusdollardenominated assets or nonus sovereign debt is insignificant in the future major adverse events outside the us could have a substantial indirect adverse impact upon us key potential events which could have such an impact include sovereign debt default default by one or more governments in their borrowings bank andor corporate debt default market and other liquidity disruptions and if stresses become especially severe the collapse of governments alliances or currencies and military conflicts the methods by which such events could adversely affect us are highly varied but broadly include the following an increase in our cost of borrowed funds or in a worst case the unavailability of borrowed funds through conventional markets impacts upon our hedging and other counterparties impacts upon our clients impacts upon the us economy especially in the areas of employment rates real estate values interest rates and inflationdeflation rates and impacts upon us from our regulatory environment which can change substantially and unpredictably from possible political response to major financial disruptions table start form 10k annual report table end table start item risk factors table end risks related to businesses we may exit we may be unable to successfully implement a disposition or winddown of businesses or units which no longer fit our strategic plans we consider possible closures and divestitures as we continue to adapt to a changing business and regulatory environment actions of this sort typically are elevated in the first few years after a significant merger for example in we closedconsolidated several dozen banking locations in the wake of the ibkc merger and we divested our title insurance business in key risks associated with exiting a business include our ability to price a sale transaction appropriately and otherwise

ability to mitigate the loss of any pretax income that the exited business produced our ability to assess and manage any loss of synergies that the exited business had with our retained businesses and our ability to manage capital liquidity and other challenges that may arise if an exit results in significant legacy cash expenditures or financial loss reputation risks our ability to conduct and grow our businesses and to obtain and retain clients is highly dependent upon external perceptions of our business practices and financial stability our reputation is therefore a key asset for us our reputation is affected principally by our business practices and how those practices are perceived and understood by others adverse perceptions regarding the practices of our competitors or our industry as a whole also may adversely impact our reputation in addition negative perceptions relating to parties with whom we have important relationships may adversely impact our reputation senior management oversees processes for reputation risk monitoring assessment and management damage to our reputation could hinder our ability to access the capital markets or otherwise impact our liquidity could hamper our ability to attract new clients and retain existing ones could impact the market value of our stock could create or aggravate regulatory difficulties and could undermine our ability to attract and retain talented associates among other things adverse impacts on our reputation or the reputation of our industry also may result in greater regulatory andor legislative scrutiny which may lead to laws or regulations that change or constrain our business or operations events that result in damage to our reputation also may increase our litigation risk political and social fragmentation in the us combined with access to social media platforms can increase reputation risk in ways that might not be easily avoided by traditional means the predominant culture within the banking industry remains traditional in order to preserve their business reputations banks generally prefer to avoid direct public involvement in political or social controversy increasingly though certain groupshaving highly specific political or social agendas and with the ability to communicate their views effectively using social media platformshave made it more difficult to maintain a traditional approach one group for example may publicly criticize a bank for having as a client a business which exploits persons of limited financial means while another group may criticize a bank for failing to have as a client the same business which serves such persons in neighborhoods that many businesses avoid as another example a group may demand that a bank cease doing business with a specific business client based on the clients industry or a specific business practice because that industry or practice though legal is objectionable to that group while the potential for such demands has always existed special interest groups today are more able and willing to publicize their criticisms and some are willing to use factual exaggerations and inflammatory language in stating their views to the public those criticisms in turn ultimately may be acted upon by legislators or regulators credit risks we face the risk that our clients may not repay their loans and that the realizable value of collateral may be insufficient to avoid a chargeoff we also face risks that other counterparties in a wide range of situations may fail to honor their obligations to pay us in our business some level of credit chargeoffs is unavoidable and overall levels of credit chargeoffs can vary substantially over time for example net chargeoffs were million in and remained historically very low through in net chargeoffs unexpectedly rose to million driven strongly by the covidinduced recession starting in march net chargeoffs in fell sharply to million a very low level historically we believe this favorable outcome was substantially affected by our client selection table start form 10k annual report table end table start item risk factors table end and underwriting processes along with our willingness to work with borrowers throughout the pandemic net chargeoffs rose in to a more normal but still low million if the us experiences an economic recession in net charge offs in the coming year could increase substantially our ability to manage credit risks depends primarily upon our ability to assess the creditworthiness of loan clients and other counterparties and the value of any collateral including real estate among other things we further manage credit risk by diversifying our loan portfolio by managing its granularity by following perrelationship lending limits and by recording and managing an allowance for loan and lease losses based on the factors mentioned above and in accordance with applicable accounting rules we further manage other counterparty credit risk in a variety of ways some of which are discussed in other parts of this item and all of which have as a primary goal the avoidance of having too much risk concentrated with any single counterparty we record loan chargeoffs in accordance with accounting and regulatory guidelines and rules as indicated in this item under the caption accounting tax risks beginning on page these guidelines and rules could change and cause provision expense or chargeoffs to be more volatile or to be recognized on an accelerated basis for reasons not always related to the underlying performance of our portfolio in fact starting in such an accounting change was made and when the covid recession occurred starting in march provision for credit losses significantly increased moreover the sec or pcaob could take accounting positions applicable to our holding company that may be inconsistent with those taken by the federal reserve or other banking regulators a significant challenge for us is to keep the credit and other models and approaches we use to originate and manage loans updated to take into account changes in the competitive environment in real estate prices and other collateral values in the economy and in the regulatory environment among other things based on our experience originating loans and servicing loan portfolios changes in modeling could have significant impacts upon our reported financial results and condition in addition we use those models and approaches to manage our loan portfolios and lending businesses to the extent our models and approaches are not consistent with underlying realworld conditions our management decisions could be misguided or otherwise affected with substantial adverse consequences to us a recent example of challenges we face in modeling stems from the covid19 pandemic and its related impacts on clients the economy and governmental interventions and accommodations the recent lowinterest rate environment which ended in elevated the traditional challenge for lenders and investors to balance taking on higher risk against the desire for higher income or yield this challenge applied not only to credit risk in lending activities but also to default and rate risks regarding investments even though short term rates are higher in long term rates continue to lag and in any case that traditional riskversusyield challenge remains in place as interest rates rise default risk likely also will rise as borrowers obligations to pay interest increase financial weaknesses generally become more evident initially this results in lower consumer credit scores and lower commercial loan grading and later results in higher default rates this effect can be amplified or hastened if the rate hikes are accompanied by recession with or without a recession the full effects of the recent rate hikes are not yet fully reflected in loan default rates realized credit losses tend to increase and decrease in a cyclical manner although the duration and timing of any given credit cycle is impossible to predict accurately through we and other us banks experienced an extended period of very low credit losses that trend appears to have reversed starting in which may signal the start of a new cycle we cannot predict how long the new cycle will run or how high credit losses will reach the credit cycle was disrupted by covid19 our expectation for loan losses in rose sharply with the covid19 pandemic and its recession though in many cases actual losses reflected in net charge offs did not later materialize our expectations for credit loss abated dramatically in and significant amounts of the loss reserves were released resulting in provision credits negative expenses we do not know what the new normal level of provision for credit loss will be once the impacts of the pandemic have fully ended or what longterm impact the pandemic will have on the credit cycle the low provision and net chargeoff levels experienced before and in were historically unusual and might not be repeated it is extremely difficult for banks and for investors to know when an uptick in credit loss is merely idiosyncratic or instead portends a major credit cycle change the composition of our loans inherently increases our sensitivity to certain credit risks at december approximately of total loans and leases consisted of the commercial financial and industrial ci portfolio while approximately consisted of the consumer real estate portfolio two large components of the ci portfolio at year end were loans to finance and insurance companies and loans to mortgage companies taken together approximately of the ci portfolio was sensitive to impacts on the financial services industry as discussed elsewhere in this item with respect to our company the financial services industry is more sensitive to interest rate and yield curve changes monetary policy regulatory policy table start form 10k annual report table end table start item risk factors table end changes in real estate and other asset values and changes in general economic conditions than many other industries negative impacts on the industry could dampen new lending in these lines of business and could create credit impacts for the loans in our portfolio the consumer real estate portfolio contains a number of concentrations which affect credit risk assessment of the portfolio product concentration the consumer real estate portfolio consists primarily of consumer installment loans and much of the remainder consists of home equity lines of credit collateral concentration this entire category is secured by residential real estate approximately of the consumer real estate portfolio consists of loans secured on a secondlien basis geographic concentration at year end about of the consumer real estate portfolio related to clients in three states florida tennessee and louisiana the consumer real estate category is highly sensitive to economic impacts on consumer clients and on residential real estate values job loss or downward job migration as well as significant life events such as divorce death or disability can significantly impact credit evaluations of the portfolio also regulatory changes discussed above and elsewhere in this item are more likely to affect the consumer category and our accounting estimates of credit loss than other loan types volatility in the oil and gas industry can impact us at yearend approximately of our total loans were directly related to the oil and gas industry in addition to general credit and other risks mentioned elsewhere in this item these businesses and their related assets are sensitive to a number of factors specific to that industry key among those is global demand for energy and other products from oil and gas in relation to supply the shifting balance between demand and supply is expressed most simply in prices significant oilprice volatility such as that experienced in can and often does impact our overall business in this industry by increasing provisioning and chargeoffs and by reducing demand for loans another set of risks specific to that industry relate to environmental concerns including the risks of increased regulation or other governmental intervention and the risks of adverse changes in consumption habits or public perceptions generally additional information concerning credit risks and our management of them is set forth under the caption asset quality beginning on page of our mda item service risks we provide a wide range of

additional information concerning f inancial industry regulations federal and state regulations significantly limit the types of activities in which we as a financial institution may engage in addition we are subject to a wide array of other regulations that govern other aspects of how we conduct our business such as in the areas of employment and intellectual property federal and state legislative and regulatory authorities increasingly consider changing these regulations or adopting new ones such actions could further limit the amount of interest or fees we can charge could further restrict our ability to collect loans or realize on collateral could affect the terms or profitability of the products and services we offer or could materially affect us in other ways the following paragraphs highlight certain specific important risk areas related to regulatory matters table start form 10k annual report table end table start item risk factors table end currently these paragraphs do not describe these risks exhaustively and they do not describe all such risks that we face currently moreover the importance of specific risks will grow or diminish as circumstances change we and our bank both are required to maintain certain regulatory capital levels and ratios us capital standards are discussed in item of this report in tabular and narrative form under the caption capital adequacy within the supervision regulation section of item which starts on page pressures to maintain appropriate capital levels and address business needs in a changing economy may lead to actions that could be dilutive or otherwise adverse to our shareholders such actions could include reduction or elimination of dividends the issuance of common or preferred stock or securities convertible

we are close to reaching billion which is the next tier above us regulatory restrictions and costs tend to increase based on asset tier the two most significant impacts on us of crossing the billion threshold are becoming subject to category iv enhanced prudential standards and becoming atrisk for being subject to a liquidity coverage ratio requirement additional information appears in the supervision regulation section of item which starts on page legal disputes are an unavoidable part of business and the outcome of pending or threatened litigation cannot be predicted with any certainty we face the risk of litigation from clients associates vendors contractual parties and other persons either singly or in class actions and from federal or state regulators matters of that sort are pending currently it is unlikely we will ever experience a time when no litigation matter is outstanding we manage litigation risks through internal controls personnel training insurance litigation management our compliance and ethics processes and other means however the commencement outcome and magnitude of litigation cannot be predicted or controlled with any certainty typically we are unable to estimate our loss exposure from legal claims until relatively late in the litigation process which can make our financial recognition of loss from litigation unpredictable and highly uneven from one period to the next for most of our pending legal matters we have established either no accrual reserve or no significant reserve financial accounting guidance requires that litigation loss be both estimable and probable before a reserve may be established recorded as a liability on our balance sheet under that guidance reserves typically are not established for most litigation matters until after preliminary motions to dismiss or to narrow the case are resolved after discovery is substantially in process and in many cases after preliminary overtures regarding settlement have occurred potentially significant cases often are pending for years before any loss is recognized and a reserve is established moreover many cases experience relatively little progress toward resolution for a long period followed by a brief period of rapid development lastly although most cases are resolved with little or no loss to us for the others our loss typically is recognized either all at once near the time of resolution or very unevenly over the life of the case additional information concerning litigation risks and our management of them all of which is incorporated into this

liabilities beginning on pages and respectively of our mda item and under the caption contingencies in note 16contingencies and other disclosures beginning on page of our financial statements item political dysfunction and volatility within the federal government both at the regulatory and congressional levels creates significant potential for major and abrupt shifts in federal policy regarding bank regulation taxes and the economy any of which could have significant impacts on our business and financial performance moreover political conflict within and among branches of government and within and among government agencies can rise to a level where daytoday functions could be interrupted or impaired data privacy is becoming a major political concern the laws governing it are new and are likely to evolve and expand many nonregulated nonbanking companies have gathered large amounts of personal details about millions of people and have the ability to analyze that data and act on that analysis very quickly this situation has prompted governmental responses two prominent responses are the european union general data protection regulation and the california consumer privacy act neither is a banking industry regulation but both apply to banks in relation to certain clients further table start form 10k annual report table end table start item risk factors table end general regulation to protect data privacy appears likely banks in the us already operate under privacyprotection laws and rules but banking industry regulations in this area might be enlarged in response to this concern public expectations concerning corporate controls on emissions of carbon dioxide methane and other greenhouse gases could increase our operating costs in the future without a corresponding increase in revenue could curtail some aspects of our business or both at present environmental regulations do not require us to monitor the direct or indirect greenhouse gas emissions associated with building operating or maintaining our physical facilities nor are we taxed or fined in relation to those emissions because such gases generally are not considered to be pollutants under us federal law changing expectations could pressure us to physically measure monitor and curtail direct emissions and to estimate indirect emissions or impacts and eventually could result in legal requirements to take those actions or to pay for measured or estimated emissions for example recently we engaged a third party to estimate our locationbased emissions even though not legally required whether or not legally required any such actions that we take increase our operating costs in addition such expectations could pressure us to discontinue business relationships with certain clients or groups of clients that have suboptimal reputations for emissions although currently no bank regulatory proposal applicable to us has been published future regulations could discourage us from lending to or serving clients in certain industries judged to be environmentally highrisk even if those elevated risk factors have a long time horizon or are speculative for other reasons changes of that sort could curtail our ability to pursue profitable business opportunities general regulation of greenhouse gas emissions carbon taxation schemes government subsidies for green industries over carbonintensive ones and other such politicalgovernmental actions could substantially and directly impact us or our clients even if we are not directly impacted in any significant manner by such actions impacts on clients could have a significant impact on us risks of expense control our ability to successfully manage expenses is important to our longterm success but in part is subject to risks beyond our control many factors can influence the amount of our expenses as well as how quickly they grow as our businesses changewhether by acquisition expansion or contractionadditional expenses can arise from asset purchases structural reorganization evolving business strategies and changing regulations among other things we manage controllable expenses and risk through a variety of means including selectively outsourcing or multisourcing various functions and procurement coordination and processes in recent years we have actively sought to make strategic businesses more efficient primarily by investing in technology rethinking and rightsizing our physical facilities and rethinking and rightsizing our workforce and incentive programs these efforts usually entail additional nearterm expenses in the form of technology purchases and implementation facility closure or renovation costs and severance costs while expected benefits typically are realized with some uncertainty in the future we have also focused on the economic profit generated by our business activities and prospects economic profit analysis attempts to relate ordinary profit to the capital employed to create that profit with the goal of achieving higher more efficient returns on capital employed overall activities with higher capital usage bear a greater burden in economic profit analysis the process is intended to allow us to more efficiently manage investment and utilization of resources economic profit analysis involves significant judgment regarding capital allocation mistakes in those judgments could result in a misallocation of resources and diminished profitability over the long run despite our efforts our costs could rise due to adverse structural changes market shifts or inflationary pressures for example in and compensation costs rose markedly due to highdemandlowsupply circumstances beyond our control geographic risks we are subject to risks of operating in various jurisdictions to a significant degree our banking business is exposed to economic regulatory natural disaster and other risks that primarily impact the southeastern and southcentral us states where we do most of our regional banking business if those regions of the us were to experience adversity not shared by other parts of the country we are likely to experience adversity to a table start form 10k annual report table end table start item risk factors table end degree not shared by those competitors which have a broader or different regional footprint examples of these kinds of risks include earthquakes in memphis hurricanes in florida louisiana the carolina coasts or the texas coast a major change in health insurance laws impacting the many healthcare companies in middle tennessee and automotive industry plant closures we have international assets mainly in the form of loans and letters of credit holding nonus assets creates a number of risks the risk that taxes fees prohibitions and other barriers and constraints may be created or increased by the us or other countries that would impact our holdings the risk that currency exchange rates could move unfavorably so as to diminish the us dollar value of assets or to enlarge the us dollar value of liabilities and the risk that legal recourse against foreign counterparties may be limited in unexpected ways our ability to manage those and other risks depends upon a number of factors including our ability to recognize and anticipate differences in legal cultural and other expectations applicable to clients regulators vendors and other business partners and counterparties and our ability to recognize and manage any exchange rate risks to which we are exposed insurance our property and casualty insurance may not cover or may be inadequate to fully cover the risks that we face and we may be adversely affected by a default by insurers we use insurance to manage a number of risks including damage or destruction of property as well as legal and other liability not all such risks are insured in any given insured situation our insurance may be inadequate to cover all loss and many risks we face are uninsurable for those risks that are insured we also face the risks that the insurer may default on its obligations or that the insurer may refuse to honor them we treat the risk of default as a type of credit risk which we manage by reviewing the insurers that we use and by striving to use more than one insurer when practical the risk of refusal whether due to honest disagreement or bad faith is inherent in any contractual situation a portion of our consumer loan portfolio involves mortgage default insurance if a default insurer were to experience a significant credit downgrade or were to become insolvent that could adversely affect the carrying value of loans insured by that company which could result in an immediate increase in our loan loss provision or writedown of the carrying value of those loans on our balance sheet and in either case a corresponding impact on our financial results if many default insurers were to experience downgrades or insolvency at the same time the risk of a financial impact would be amplified we own certain bankowned life insurance policies as assets on our balance sheet some of those policies are general account and others are separate account the general account policies are subject to the risk that the carrier might experience a significant downgrade or become insolvent the separate account policies are less susceptible to carrier risk but do carry a higher risk of value fluctuations in securities which underlie those policies both risks are managed through periodic reviews of the carriers and the underlying security values however particularly for the general account policies our ability to liquidate a policy in anticipation of an adverse carrier event is significantly limited by applicable insurance contracts and regulations as well as by a substantial tax penalty which could be levied upon early policy termination when we selfinsure certain exposures our estimates of future expenditures may be inadequate for the actual expenditures that occur for example we selfinsure our associate healthinsurance benefit program we estimate future expenditures and establish accruals reserves based on the estimates if actual expenditures were to exceed our estimates in a future period our future expenses could be adversely and unexpectedly increased liquidity funding risks liquidity is essential to our business model and a lack of liquidity or an increase in the cost of liquidity may materially and adversely affect our businesses results of operations financial condition and cash flows in general the costs of our funding directly impact our costs of doing business and therefore can positively or negatively affect our financial results our funding requirements in were met principally by deposits by financing from other financial institutions and by funds obtained from the capital markets deposits traditionally have provided our most affordable funds and by far the largest portion of funding however deposit trends can shift with economic conditions if interest rates fall deposit levels in our bank might fall perhaps fairly quickly if a tipping point is reached as depositors become more comfortable with risk and seek higher returns in other vehicles this could pressure us to raise interest we pay on our deposits which could shrink our net interest margin if loan rates do not rise correspondingly table start form 10k annual report table end table start item risk factors table end the extremely low interest rate environment of the past several years ended in contrary to the expectations outlined in the paragraph above deposit levels prior to climbed possibly buoyed by the severe volatility experienced by the stock markets in coupled with federal pandemic assistance particularly direct cash payments to most citizens in and although significant market volatility resumed in and we have generally raised deposit interest rates to attract and maintain clients we do not expect deposit levels to rise appreciably in and in fact there is significant risk levels will fall especially if federal reserve tightening actions push the economy into recession and push unemployment rates higher deposit levels may be affected fairly quickly by changes in monetary policy the federal reserve currently is pursuing a tightening policy the federal reserve has indicated it intends to continue tightening based on economic events during the year including inflationary pressures employment data and overall economic activity additional information concerning monetary policy changes appears under the caption risks associated with monetary events beginning on page within this item and under the caption federal reserve policy in transition within the market uncertainties and prospective trends section of mda item which begins on page the market among banks for deposits may be impacted by regulatory funding and liquidity requirements regulatory rules generally provide favorable treatment for core deposits institutions with less than billion of assets are not required to maintain a minimum liquidity coverage ratio at or above billion the requirement increases with size and certain activities the largest banks which must maintain the highest minimum ratio may be incented to compete for core deposits vigorously although midsized banks like ours are only lightly impacted by this rule if some large banks in our markets take aggressive actions we could lose deposit share or be compelled to adjust our deposit pricing and practices in ways that could increase our costs we also depend upon financing from private institutional or other investors by means of the capital markets in we issued and sold million of preferred stock along with a total of billion of senior and subordinated notes in we issued and sold another million of preferred stock we believe we could access the capital markets again if we desired to do so though the pending td merger likely would complicate such a transaction risk remains however that capital markets may become unavailable to us for reasons beyond our control a number of more general factors could make funding more difficult more expensive or unavailable on affordable terms these include but are not limited to our financial results organizational or political changes adverse impacts on our reputation changes in the activities of our business partners disruptions in the capital markets specific events that adversely impact the financial services industry counterparty availability changes affecting our loan portfolio or other assets changes affecting our corporate and regulatory structure interest rate fluctuations ratings agency actions general economic conditions and the legal regulatory accounting and tax environments governing our funding transactions in addition our ability to raise funds is strongly affected by the general state of the us and world economies and financial markets as well as the policies and capabilities of the us government and its agencies and may remain or become increasingly difficult due to economic and other factors beyond our control changes associated with libor also may impact our funding ability see interest rate and yield curve risks beginning on page events affecting interest rates markets and other factors may adversely affect the demand for our products and services in our fixed income business as a result disruptions in those areas may adversely impact our earnings in that business unit credit ratings our credit ratings directly affect the availability and cost of our unsecured funding our holding company the corporation and our bank currently receive ratings from several rating agencies for unsecured borrowings a rating below investment grade typically reduces availability and increases the cost of marketbased funding a debt rating of baa3 or higher by moodys investors service or bbb or higher by fitch ratings is considered investment grade for many purposes at december both rating agencies rated the unsecured senior debt of the corporation and of the bank as investment grade to the extent that in the future we depend on institutional borrowing and the capital markets for funding and capital we could experience reduced liquidity and increased cost of unsecured funding if our debt ratings were lowered particularly if lowered below investment grade in addition other actions by ratings agencies can create uncertainty about our ratings in the future and thus can adversely affect the cost and availability of funding including placing us on negative outlook or on watchlist please note that a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time and should be evaluated independently of any other rating table start form 10k annual report table end table start item risk factors table end reductions in our credit ratings could result in counterparties reducing or terminating their relationships with us some parties with whom we do business may have internal policies restricting the business that can be done with financial institutions such as the bank that have credit ratings lower than a certain threshold reductions in our credit ratings could allow some counterparties to terminate and immediately force us to settle certain derivatives agreements and could force us to provide additional collateral with respect to certain derivatives agreements under our margin agreements we are required to post collateral in the amount of our derivative liability positions with derivative counterparties fhn could be asked to post collateral of an undetermined amount based on changes in credit ratings and derivative value interest rate yield curve risks we are subject to interest rate risk because a significant portion of our business involves borrowing and lending money and investing in financial instruments a considerable portion of our funding comes from shortterm and demand deposits while a sizeable portion of our lending and investing is in mediumterm and longterm instruments changes in interest rates directly impact our revenues and expenses and could expand or compress our net interest margin we actively manage our balance sheet to control the risks of a reduction in net interest margin brought about by ordinary fluctuations in rates in addition our fixed income business tends to perform better when rates decline or markets are volatile which tends to partially offset net interest margin compression a flat or inverted yield curve may reduce our net interest margin and adversely affect our lending and fixed income businesses the yield curve is a reflection of interest rates at various maturities applicable to assets and liabilities the yield curve is steep when shortterm rates are much lower than longterm rates it is flat when shortterm rates and longterm rates are nearly the same and it is inverted when shortterm rates exceed longterm rates historically the yield curve is usually upward sloping higher rates for longer terms however the yield curve can be relatively flat or inverted downward sloping inversion normally is rare but has happened several times in the past few years and in fact was common in the second half of and early a flat or inverted yield curve tends to decrease net interest margin which would adversely impact our lending businesses and it tends to reduce demand for longterm debt securities which would adversely impact the revenues of our fixed income business during late our net interest margin overall did not compress but actually expanded as we were able to increase average loan rates faster than average funding rates in there is significant risk especially if inversion remains common and a recession begins that our net interest margin could compress marketindexed deposit products are very sensitive to changes in shortterm rates and our use of them increases our exposure to such changes if market rates rise an increase in those deposit rates may be necessary before we are able to effect similar increases in loan rates generally we try to moderate our use of these products when rates are rising and we followed that guideline in expectations by the market regarding the direction of future interest rate movements can impact the demand for and value of our fixed income investments and can impact the revenues of our fixed income business this risk is most apparent during times when strong expectations have not yet been reflected in market rates or when expectations are especially weak or uncertain over a business cycle period of many years substantial revenue reduction in fixed income is unavoidable during the down part of the cycle the most recent revenue reduction occurred in and we cannot predict when it will end the discontinuance of libor as a viable benchmark rate may adversely affect our business and our operating results in the chief executive of the united kingdom financial conduct authority fca which regulates the london interbank offered rate libor announced that it intends to halt persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor in the fca announced that tenors of us dollar usd libor will no longer be published as follows one week and 2month usd libor has not been published since december and all other usd libor tenors eg overnight 1month 3month 6month and 12month tenors will not be published after june in the us multiple alternative reference rates have become accepted alternatives to libor these alternatives include sofr the alternative reference rates committee arrc is a group of privatemarket participants convened by the federal reserve board and the federal reserve bank of new york new york fed to help ensure a successful transition from usd libor to a more robust reference rate the arrc has recommended the secured overnight financing rate sofr as its preferred alternative sofr is published by the new york fed but is not directly comparable to libor and cannot table start form 10k annual report table end table start item risk factors table end easily or simply be substituted for it in outstanding instruments key differences between the two are sofr is based on secured lending libor is not and sofr historically has been published only as an overnight rate while libor is published in many shortterm forward looking maturity tenors recently forwardlooking term sofr rates have been published in several tenors to address the second difference ameribor another alternative the american interbank offered rate ameribor index is produced by the american financial exchange ameribor is based on

published by bloomberg index services limited bsby is based on actual transaction data involving unsecured credit fhn ceased originating new loans using libor and began making all three of those alternatives available to most commercial clients in late for consumer adjustable rate mortgages fhn offers only sofr as the reference rate which fhn believes has become the leading alternative in the us for that category of loans outstanding loans affected by the discontinuance of libor have been and are being transitioned to new reference rates if maturing later than the applicable discontinuance date through client agreedupon amendments or pursuant to fallback language in the loan documentation and in recent federal legislation these transitions began late in and will conclude in new loans have been and continue to be originated using nonlibor reference rates a few instruments issued by us including certain series of preferred stock and certain trust preferred obligations have floating rate terms based on libor or have fixed rates that later will convert to floating rate terms based on libor we have risk that an adverse outcome of the libor transition could increase our interest

have a material impact upon our assets liabilities and financial results we have a number of assets and obligations that are linked directly or indirectly to major securities markets significant changes in market performance can have a material impact upon our assets liabilities and financial results an example of that linkage is our obligation to fund our pension plan so that it may satisfy benefit claims in the future our pension funding obligations generally depend upon actuarial estimates of benefits claims the discount rate used to estimate the present values of those claims and estimates of plan asset values our obligations to fund the plan can be affected by changes in any of those three factors accordingly our obligations diminish if the plans investments perform better than expectations or if estimates are changed anticipating better performance and can grow if those investments perform poorly or if expectations worsen a rise in interest rates is likely to negatively impact the values of fixed income assets held in the plan but would also result in an increase in the discount rate used to measure the present value of future benefit payments similarly our obligations can be impacted by changes in mortality tables or other actuarial inputs we manage the risk of rate changes by investing plan assets in fixed income securities having maturities table

to credit risk in the normal course of our businesses we attempt to create partial or full economic hedges of various though not all financial risks for example our fixed income unit manages interest rate risk on a portion of its trading portfolio with short positions futures and options contracts we hedge the risk of interest rate movements related to the gap between the time we originate mortgage loans and the time we sell them and we use derivatives including swaps swaptions caps forward contracts options and collars that are designed to moderate the impact on earnings as interest rates change generally in the last example these hedged items include certain term borrowings and certain heldtomaturity loans hedging creates certain risks for us including the risk that the other party to the hedge transaction will fail to perform counterparty risk which is a type of credit risk and the risk that the hedge will not fully protect us from loss as intended hedge failure risk unexpected counterparty failure or hedge failure could have a significant adverse effect on our liquidity and earnings mortgage business risks two of our mortgagerelated businessesmortgage origination and lending to mortgage companiesare highly sensitive to interest rates and rate cycles when rates are higher client activity and our related income tends to be muted lower rates tend to foster higher activity the us experienced extremely low interest rates for several years ending in early rising rates in substantially curtailed our income from these businesses for example by late consumer mortgage refinancings fell to extremely low levels rates are likely to continue to rise in and further reductions in income from our mortgagerelated businesses are possible additional information concerning rates and their impacts upon us is presented under the caption cyclicality within the other business information section of item which starts on page in risks associated with monetary events beginning on page in interest rate and yield curve risks beginning on page and under the caption federal reserve policy in transition within the market uncertainties and prospective trends section of our mda item beginning on page we have contractual risks from our mortgage business our traditional mortgage business primarily consists of helping clients obtain home mortgages which we sell rather than hold or which qualify for a governmentguarantee program the mortgage terms conform to the requirements of the mortgage buyers or government agencies and we make representations to those buyers or agencies concerning conformity of each mortgage at origination although the buyers and agencies generally take the risk that a mortgage defaults we retain the risk that our representations were materially incorrect in such a case the buyer or agency generally has the power to force us to take the loan back for its face value or to make the buyer or agency whole for loss some government mortgage programs could impose penalties on us for misrepresentations at the time of obtaining benefits under the program penalties can be severe up to three times the agencys loss as a result mortgage origination processes need to emphasize being thorough and correct in compliance with all agency standards those processes tend to slow the mortgage lending process for clients and increase the complexity of the paperwork the mortgage servicing business creates regulatory risks servicing requires continual interaction with consumer clients federal state and sometimes local laws regulate when and how we interact with consumer clients the requirements can be complex and difficult for us to administer especially if a client is having difficulty with the mortgage loan failure to follow the applicable rules can result in significant penalties or other loss for us the mortgage servicing business creates financial reporting valuation risks our contractual right to service a loan generally is viewed as an asset for financial reporting purposes servicing rights are initially recognized at fair value which affects the gains recognized upon sale of the related loans thereafter servicing rights are amortized and reviewed for impairment the valuations of servicing rights are dependent upon a number of inputs and assumptions that require management judgment if our servicing rights become large in relation to our overall size especially in volatile times the impact of valuation changes can be significant and difficult to predict table start form 10k annual report table end table start item risk factors table end pre2009 mortgage business risks we have risks from the mortgagerelated businesses legacy first horizon exited in including mortgage loan repurchase and lossreimbursement risk claims of improper foreclosure practices and claims of noncompliance with contractual and regulatory requirements in we exited our national mortgage and related lending businesses we retain the risk of liability to clients and contractual parties with whom we dealt in the course of operating those businesses additional information concerning risks related to our former mortgage businesses and our management of them all of which is incorporated into this item by this reference is set forth under the captions repurchase obligations beginning on page and contingent liabilities beginning on page of our mda item and under the captions exposures from pre2009 mortgage business and mortgage loan repurchase and foreclosure liability both within note 16contingencies and other disclosures of our financial statements item which note begins on page accounting tax risks the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements the estimate that is consistently one of our most critical is the level of the allowance for credit losses however other estimates can be highly significant at discrete times or during periods of varying length for example the valuation or impairment of our deferred tax assets estimates are made at specific points in time as actual events unfold estimates are adjusted accordingly due to the inherent nature of these estimates it is possible that at some time in the future we may significantly increase the allowance for credit losses andor sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the provided allowance or we may recognize a significant provision for impairment of assets or we may make some other adjustment that will differ materially from the estimates that we make today moreover in some cases especially concerning litigation and other contingency matters where critical information is inadequate often we are unable to make estimates until fairly late in a lengthy process a significant merger or acquisition requires us to make many estimates including the fair values of acquired assets and liabilities with larger transactions fair value and other estimations can take up to four quarters to finalize these estimates and their revisions can have a substantial effect on the presentation of our financial condition and operating results after the transaction closes in addition the excess of the value paid by us in the merger or acquisition over the fair value of the assets acquired net of liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill goodwill is subject to periodic impairment assessment a process that can result in impairment expense which may be significant and sudden changes in accounting rules can significantly affect how we record and report assets liabilities revenues expenses and earnings although such changes generally affect all companies in a given industry in practice changes sometimes have a disparate impact due to differences in the circumstances or business operations of companies within the same industry one such accounting change asu measurement of credit losses on financial instruments substantially impacts the measurement and recognition of credit losses for certain assets including most loans under asu when we make or acquire a new loan we are required to recognize immediately the current expected credit loss or cecl of that loan we will also reevaluate cecl each quarter that the loan is outstanding cecl is the difference between our cost and the net amount we expect to collect over the life of the loan using certain estimation methods that incorporate macroeconomic forecasts and our experience with other similar loans in contrast the pre2020 accounting standard delayed recognition until loss was probable very likely we adopted asu and cecl accounting starting in with the impact on regulatory capital having a phasein period starting in recognition of estimated credit loss was significantly accelerated compared to prececl practice which was aggravated by the actual and projected effects of the pandemic that acceleration could happen again especially if a recession occurs or is expected to occur additional information concerning asu appears in note 1significant accounting policies within our financial statements item beginning on page and in item under the caption cecl accounting and covid19 within the section entitled significant business developments over past five years which begins on page all of which information is incorporated into this item by reference in comparison with former pre2020 standards cecl accounting likely will continue to result in a significant increase in our provision for credit losses expense and allowance reserve during any period of loan growth including organic growth and growth created by acquisition or merger through the increased provision table start form 10k annual report table end table start item risk factors table end adversely impact our earnings and correspondingly our regulatory capital levels and enhance volatility in loan loss provision and allowance levels from quarter to quarter and year to year especially during times when the economy is in transition or experiencing significant volatility moreover once fully phased in cecl creates an incentive for banks to reduce new lending in the down part of the economic cycle in order to reduce loss recognition and conserve regulatory capital that perverse incentive could nationwide prolong a down cycle in the economy and delay a recovery changes in regulatory rules can create significant accounting impacts for us because we operate in a regulated industry we prepare regulatory financial reports based on regulatory accounting standards changes in those standards can have significant impacts upon us in terms of regulatory compliance in addition such changes can impact our ordinary financial reporting and uncertainties related to regulatory changes can create uncertainties in our financial reporting our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented internal controls disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures controls and procedures must be effective in order to provide assurance that financial reports are materially accurate a failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations share owning governance risks the principal source of cash flow to pay dividends on our stock as well as service our debt is dividends and distributions from the bank and the bank may become unable to pay dividends to us without regulatory approval first horizon corporation primarily depends upon common dividends from the bank for cash to fund dividends we pay to our common and preferred shareholders and to service our outstanding debt regulatory constraints might constrain or prevent the bank from declaring and paying dividends to us in without regulatory approval applying the dividend restrictions imposed under applicable federal and state rules the banks total amount available for dividends without obtaining regulatory approval was billion at january also we are required to provide financial support to the bank accordingly at any given time a portion of our funds may need to be used for that purpose and therefore would be unavailable for dividends furthermore the federal reserve has issued policy statements generally requiring insured banks and bank holding companies only to pay dividends out of current operating earnings the federal reserve has released a supervisory letter advising bank holding companies among other things that as a general matter a bank holding company should inform the federal reserve and should eliminate defer or significantly reduce its dividends if i the bank holding companys net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters net of dividends previously paid during that period is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends ii the bank holding companys prospective rate of earnings is not consistent with the bank holding companys capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition or iii the bank holding company will not meet or is in danger of not meeting its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios our shareholders may suffer dilution if we raise capital through public or private equity financings to fund our operations to increase our capital or to expand if we raise funds by issuing equity securities or instruments that are convertible into equity securities the percentage ownership of our current common shareholders will be reduced the new equity securities may have rights and preferences superior to those of our common or outstanding preferred stock and additional issuances could be at a sales price which is dilutive to current shareholders we may also issue equity securities directly as consideration for acquisitions we may make that would be dilutive to shareholders in terms of voting power and shareofownership and could be dilutive financially or economically the ibkc merger for example resulted in a significant increase in our outstanding shares in we issued to former ibkc shareholders common shares representing about of our postclosing outstanding shares our issuance of preferred stock raises regulatory capital without issuing common shares but creates or expands our general obligation to pay all preferred dividends ahead of any common dividends currently we have seven series of preferred stock outstanding one issued by the bank and six by first horizon corporation subject to capital needs and market conditions additional series may be issued in the future provisions of tennessee law and certain provisions of our charter and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or could have the effect of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire control of us these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if an acquisition might be at a price attractive to many of our shareholders in addition federal banking laws prohibit nonfinancialindustry companies from owning a bank table start form 10k annual report table end table start item risk factors table end and require regulatory approval of any change in control of a bank certain legal rights of holders of our common stock and of depositary shares related to our preferred stock to pursue claims against us or the depositary as applicable are limited by our bylaws and by the terms of the deposit agreements our bylaws provide that unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum a state or federal court located within shelby county in the state of tennessee will be the sole and exclusive forum for i any derivative action or proceeding brought in our right or name ii any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director officer or other associate of ours to us or our shareholders iii any action asserting a claim against us or any director officer or other associate of ours arising pursuant to any provision of the tennessee business corporation act of our charter or bylaws or iv any action asserting a claim against us or any director officer or other associate of ours that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine in addition each deposit agreement between us and the depositary which governs the rights of the depositary shares related to our series b c and d preferred stock respectively provides that any action or proceeding arising out of or relating in any way to the deposit agreement may only be brought in a state court located in the state of new york or in the united states district court for the southern district of new york the foregoing exclusive forum clauses may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against us or our directors officers or other associates or against the depositary as applicable exclusive forum clauses may also lead to increased costs to bring a claim or may limit the ability of holders of our common stock or depositary shares to bring a claim in a judicial forum they find favorable in addition the exclusive forum clauses in our bylaws and deposit agreements could apply to actions or proceedings that may arise under the federal securities laws depending on the nature of the claim alleged to the extent these exclusive forum clauses restrict the courts in which holders of our common stock or depositary shares may bring claims arising under the federal securities laws there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such provisions these exclusive forum provisions do not mean that holders of our common stock or depositary shares have waived our obligations to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder table start form 10k annual
