income is fhns largest source of revenue and is the difference between the interest earned on interestearning assets generally loans leases and investment securities and the interest expense incurred in connection with interestbearing liabilities generally deposits and borrowed funds the level of net interest income is primarily a function of the difference between the effective yield on average interestearning assets and the effective cost of interestbearing liabilities these factors are influenced by the pricing and mix of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities which in turn are impacted by external factors such as local economic conditions competition for loans and deposits the monetary policy of the frb and market interest rates the following tables present the major

inflation by rapidly increasing shortterm interest rates and ending asset purchases low unemployment rates despite moderate economic growth and a profoundly inverted yield curve key aspects were although the us economy flirted with recession in it did not officially enter one in recession risk remains high but growth has remained positive although recessionary expectations were and remain high consumption and employment have been robust the rise in shortterm interest rates by the federal reserve was both rapid and substantial taking the overnight fed funds rate from in march to a year later hikes since first quarter have been much more modest and gradual in response to 2022s extremely rapid and vigorous tightening of monetary policy the inflation rate in the us has fallen but remains high in relation to the decade preceding the covid19 pandemic and in relation to the federal reserves stated longterm goal of monetary tightening often creates yield curve inversion for a time in the current cycle traditional inversion when tenyear treasury rates are below twoyear rates has been both very deep and unusually sustained with the current inversion having begun in the summer of

point fhn cannot predict exactly when or how much shortterm rates will be further raised when raises will halt entirely a socalled pause how marketdriven longterm rates will behave nor how those actions may affect financial markets during the rest of yield curve during the past six quarters the yield curve flattened and inverted many times unusual yield curve effects including inversion are common when monetary policy changes and those effects are likely to continue a traditional measure of inversion occurs when the twoyear us treasury rate is higher than the tenyear rate traditional inversion has been sustained for the last half of and all of to date an unusually long period the degree of inversion has varied but generally has been much deeper than is typically the case sustained traditional yield curve inversion is viewed with statistical support as a harbinger of economic recession the most recent period with deeper and longerlasting inversion was over years ago that year period was marked by stagflation low economic growth coupled with high inflation followed by extremely robust interest rate hikes and a strong recession yield curve flattening and inversion generally

as loan rates rose faster than funding costs but that unusual result ended in recession the us economy contracted experienced negative growth during the first two quarters of in both cases modestly although two consecutive quarters of contraction often coincides with recession in it did not the economy expanded in each of the most recent four quarters the rate of expansion fell during the first three of those quarters but the most recent quarter reversed that trend recession expectations in the us were high in and first quarter they moderated in second quarter despite consecutive quarters of falling growth rates with the announcement in late july that second quarter economic growth unexpectedly was stronger than first quarter recession expectations may continue to moderate in third quarter stronger economic performance in second quarter may make further rate hikes more likely however which tend to heighten recession expectations banking crisis in march two large regional us banks failed after sudden large deposit outflows and a major swiss bank was acquired by another bank at the behest of regulators the two us failures appear to have been caused in significant part by risky funds management practices exacerbated by a highly unusual deposit mix and 2022s sharp rise in rates in the aftermath of these two failures bank investors and clients across the us became more focused on deposit mix funding risk management and other safetysoundness concerns the market values of virtually all us bank stocks fell quickly and strongly in march with a few falling about the media published stories about actual and possible bank runs by depositors most us banks saw net outflows of deposits in and early as the impacts of covid19 crisis programs faded and rates available from nonbankaccount investments improved according to federal reserve data starting in midmarch the two failures triggered an abrupt net deposit outflow from all but the largest us banks specifically during the week of march the largest us banks as a group saw net deposit inflows exceeding billion while all other smaller us banks as a group saw net outflows of nearly billion the next week large and small us banks experienced net outflows of roughly and billion respectively the march crisis shock was shortlived however during the final week of march both large and small us banks collectively experienced net inflows of deposits roughly mirroring the first week of march before the crisis emerged since march deposits at smaller banks have continued to rise slowly while the largest banks have reverted to premarch trends with slow net outflows the two us bank failures resulted in congressional calls for higher regulation of midsized regional banks especially for those with billion or more of assets fhn cannot predict what if any legislative or regulatory outcomes will result from the crisis in early may a third large regional us bank failed after experiencing very large deposit outflows in march although this failure was widely anticipated volatility in regional bank stocks reappeared in may by june bankstock volatility had abated again but with regional bank prices well

rise in lending rates outpaced the rise in deposit and other funding rates in the first quarter of that outpacing ended with fhns net interest margin compressing slightly from fourth quarter that compression worsened in second quarter as fhns funding rates especially for deposits rose more than lending rates in and early fhn experienced a normalization of deposit levels since first quarter as it allowed higher cost surge deposits resulting from economic stimulus programs to move off its balance sheet net deposit outflows ranged from roughly to billion in each of the last three quarters of and fell again by roughly billion in first quarter that outflow trend ended in second quarter as fhn had net deposit inflows of billion from march to june to mitigate net deposit outflows fhn increased deposit rates appreciably over the past several quarters particularly in in contrast during this period fhns total loans grew modestly each quarter these impacts resulted from a deliberate plan to allow deposits to return to more normal levels in relation to loans fhn started raising deposit rates to more competitive levels during first quarter launched a major depositgrowth campaign in second quarter and expects to continue to meet competitive pressures going forward all of these actions have increased fhns funding costs from deposits although fhn cannot predict future actions of its depositors fhn believes it has avoided key characteristics of the three failed us banks specifically fhn has a traditional customer mix for a bank its size of fhns deposits at june were fdic insured and another were collateralized and because fhn kept a substantial portion of the pandemic deposit inflows in overnight and other cash investments the market value losses embedded in fhns investments if fully realized would not diminish fhns regulatory capital levels appreciably in relation to regulatory requirements as mentioned above in the federal reserve has slowed the rate of increase of interest rates and fhn currently expects rate increases to pause at some point this year or early next year depending primarily on inflation rate data increased stability in interest rates eventually may bring increased stability in funding including deposits in addition some of fhns businesses have been negatively impacted by rising rates rate increases have pushed home mortgage rates in the us much higher than in early fhns direct mortgage lending and lending to mortgage companies saw business decline significantly in moreover fhns revenues from bond trading and related activities fell significantly in due to rising rates coupled with elevated market volatility these impacts have continued in a recession if one occurs likely would have a significant negative impact on fhns businesses overall demand for loans likely would fall loan losses and provision expense likely would rise many commercial activities that generate fee income likely would decline and competition for clients likely would sharpen fhn already has experienced some of these impacts the deeper or longer a recession lasts the more significant these negative impacts are likely to be for fhn however as mentioned above in the past few months recessionary expectations have abated somewhat in late july it was unexpectedly reported that the us economy grew more strongly in second quarter than in first quarter which may further blunt recessionary expectations 2q23 form 10q report part i item managements discussion analysis mda libor reference rate reform background the london interbank offered rate libor was for many years the most widely used reference rate in the world about a decade ago evidence emerged that some members of the panel that set libor may have manipulated the published libor rates rather than using strictly goodfaith judgments in the financial conduct authority fca the united kingdoms regulator of libor set in motion a sequence of events that would ultimately lead to the cessation of libor the cessation of libor came in successive stages in the federal reserve the occ and the fdic jointly encouraged us banks to transition away from libor for new contracts as soon as practicable and in any event by december as such that date became the deadline by which financial institutions and other market participants were required to cease origination of new libor contracts two of libors lesserused us dollar tenors namely 1week and 2month usd libor ceased to be published after december the remaining us dollar tenors of libor eg overnight 1month 3month 6month and 12month tenors ceased to be published after june in march congress passed the adjustable interest rate libor act the legislation addresses loans that remained on libor as of the june cessation date and that either have no fallback provisions or that contain fallback provisions that do not identify a specific benchmark replacement per the legislation at the final cessation of usd libor banks may cause such loans to fall back to a sofrbased benchmark rate with such rate to be selected by the federal reserve board the libor act also provides safe harbor from liability for banks that select the boardselected replacement benchmark rate at the cessation of libor in december the federal reserve board issued regulation zz its final rule to implement the adjustable interest rate libor act fhns cessation of the use of libor for new contracts in the fourth quarter of fhn ceased using libor for new contracts all required systems processes and reporting were updated to accommodate the transition and fhns associates were trained on the use of the new benchmark rates that had been introduced as replacements for libor within fhns consumer portfolio libor had been referenced principally in adjustablerate mortgages arms beginning in the fourth quarter of new arms referenced 30day average sofr rather than libor within fhns commercial portfolio libor had been widely used in floatingrate loans additionally many interest rate swaps referenced libor beginning in the fourth quarter of fhn made available multiple benchmark rate options for floatingrate commercial loans most commercial clients who had previously used liborindexed floatingrate loans have since selected cme term sofr as their benchmark rate for new and renewing commercial loans cme term sofr is also now the most prevalent rate used in fhns interest rate derivatives contracts with its clients published by cme group term sofr is a forwardlooking rate with 1month 3month 6month and 12month tenors and is based on sofr futures contracts the alternative reference rates committee arrc recommended conventions for term sofr rates recommended cme group as the administrator for term sofr and subsequently recommended cme groups term sofr rates furthermore regulation zz identifies cme term sofr plus a spread adjustment as defined in the libor act as the boardselected replacement rate for the purposes of loans that are repriced in accordance with the libor act upon the june final cessation of libor fhns transition of existing contracts away from libor as noted above two of libors lesserused us dollar tenors namely 1week and 2month usd libor ceased to be published after december prior to that date fhn renegotiated terms with clients whose loans were based on 1week or 2month usd libor only a small portion of fhns clients had such loans for the remainder of fhns liborindexed commercial loans ie those with overnight 1month 3month 6month and 12month tenors and for fhns liborindexed interest rate swaps fhn began amending existing liborindexed contracts starting in the fourth quarter of the objective has been to amend all contracts that reference libor by the time of such contracts first interestrate reset date that references a determination date after june as such the balance of commercial loans that reference libor fell from billion as of december to billion as of june additionally the notional amount of interest rate swaps that reference libor fell from billion as of december to billion as of june fhn will amend approximately million in liborindexed commercial loans in accordance with the terms of the march libor act and regulation zz upon the first interest rate reset date after june with the benchmark rate changing to cme term sofr most of these loans will amend in the third quarter of 2q23 form 10q report part i item managements discussion analysis mda an additional billion in liborindexed commercial loans are syndicated loans on which fhn is not the agent bank per conversations with many of the agent banks their intent is to similarly amend the pricing on these loans in accordance with the terms of the libor act and regulation zz upon the first interest rate reset date after june similarly the remaining billion in liborindexed interest rate swaps will fall back to a sofrbased rate in accordance with the terms of the libor act and regulation zz prior to the end of in accordance with the terms of the libor act and regulation zz the replacement benchmark rate for consumer loans will be a sofrbased rate published by refinitiv limited equal to cme term sofr plus a transition tenor spread adjustment fhns remaining liborindexed consumer loans are residential arms the borrowers have been notified that their arms will reference the sofrbased refinitiv rate upon the first interest rate reset that references a date after june because many of these existing liborindexed arms have a 6month tenor and because many of these loans have a 45day lookback period the last of these loans to be amended to the sofrbased refinitiv rate will be amended in the first quarter of table i224 libor exposures dollars in billions as of june mature after june commercial loans a consumer loans a customer swaps b a amounts represent outstanding loan balances as of june b fhn has entered into offsetting upstream transactions with dealers to offset its market risk exposure in addition to the abovereferenced loan and swap exposure fhn has less than billion in corporate exposures including preferred stock investment securities and balance sheet hedges that will fall back to a sofrbased rate in the coming months financial accounting aspects in the fasb issued asu facilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting which
