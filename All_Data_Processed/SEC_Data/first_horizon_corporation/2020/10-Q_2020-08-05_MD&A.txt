stress appropriate for our trading securities portfolio first horizon national corp 2q20 form 10q report a summary of fhns var and svar measures for 1day and 10day time horizons is as follows table

extreme volatility as a result of economic uncertainty associated with the covid19 pandemic fhns overall var measure includes both interest rate risk and credit spread risk separate measures of these component risks are as follows table 22schedule of risks included in var as of june as of june as of december  in thousands 1day 10day 1day 10day 1day 10day interest rate risk credit spread risk var and svar increased due to extreme volatility as a result of economic uncertainty associated with the covid19 pandemic the potential risk of loss reflected by fhns var measures assumes the trading securities inventory is static because fhns fixed income division procures fixed income securities for purposes of distribution to customers its trading securities inventory turns over regularly additionally fixed income traders actively manage the trading securities inventory continuously throughout each trading day accordingly fhns trading securities inventory is highly dynamic rather than static as a result it would be rare for fixed income to incur a negative revenue day in its fixed income activities of the level indicated by its var measurements first horizon national corp 2q20 form 10q report in addition to being used in fhns daily market risk management process the var and svar measures are also used by fhn in computing its regulatory market risk capital requirements in accordance with the market risk capital rules for additional information regarding fhns capital adequacy refer to the capital section of this mda fhn also performs stress tests on its trading securities portfolio to calculate the potential loss under various assumed market scenarios key assumed stresses used in those tests are down bps assumes an instantaneous downward move in interest rates of basis points at all points on the interest rate yield curve up bps assumes an instantaneous upward move in interest rates of basis points at all points on the interest rate yield curve curve flattening assumes an instantaneous flattening of the interest rate yield curve through an increase in shortterm rates and a decrease in longterm rates the 2year point on the treasury yield curve is assumed to increase basis points and the 10year point on the treasury yield curve is assumed to decrease basis points shifts in other points on the yield curve are predicted based on their correlation to the 2year and 10year points curve steepening assumes an instantaneous steepening of the interest rate yield curve through a decrease in shortterm rates and an increase in longterm rates the 2year point on the treasury yield curve is assumed to decrease basis points and the 10year point on the treasury yield curve is assumed to increase basis points shifts in other points on the yield curve are predicted based on their correlation to the 2year and 10year points credit spread widening assumes an instantaneous increase in credit spreads the difference between yields on treasury securities and nontreasury securities of basis points model validation trading risk management personnel within fixed income have primary responsibility for model risk management with respect to the model used by fhn to compute its var measures and perform stress testing on the trading inventory among other procedures these personnel monitor model results and perform periodic backtesting as part of an ongoing process of validating the accuracy of the model these model risk management activities are subject to annual review by fhns model validation group an internal assurance group charged with oversight responsibility for fhns model risk management interest rate risk management there have been no significant changes to fhns interest rate risk management practices as described under interest rate risk management beginning on page of item to fhns annual report on form 10k for the year ended december net interest income simulation analysis the information provided in this section including the discussion regarding the outcomes of simulation analysis and rate shock analysis is forwardlooking actual results if the assumed scenarios were to occur could differ because of interest rate movements the ability of management to execute its business plans and other factors including those presented in the forwardlooking statements section of this mda management uses a simulation model to measure interest rate risk and to formulate strategies to improve balance sheet positioning earnings or both within fhns interest rate risk liquidity and capital guidelines interest rate exposure is measured by forecasting months of nii under various interest rate scenarios and comparing the percentage change in nii for each scenario to a base case scenario where interest rates remain unchanged assumptions are made regarding future balance sheet composition interest rate movements and loan and deposit pricing in addition assumptions are made about the magnitude of asset prepayments and earlier than anticipated deposit withdrawals the results of these scenarios help fhn develop strategies for managing exposure to interest rate risk while management believes the assumptions used and scenarios selected in its simulations are reasonable simulation modeling provides only an estimate not a precise calculation of exposure to any given change in interest rates based on a static balance sheet as of june nii expo sures over the next months assuming rate shocks of plus basis points basis points basis points and basis points are estimated to have favorable variances of percent percent percent and percent respectively compared to base nii a steepening yield curve scenario where longterm rates increase by basis points and shortterm rates are static results in a favorable nii variance of percent a flattening yield curve scenario where longterm rates decrease by basis points and shortterm rates are static results in an unfavorable nii variance of percent rate shocks of minus basis points and basis points result in unfavorable nii variances of percent and percent these hypothetical scenarios are used to create a risk measurement framework and do not necessarily represent managements current view of future interest rates or market developments fhns net interest income has been and likely will continue to be impacted by the disruption from the first horizon national corp 2q20 form 10q report covid19 pandemic the increase in the unemployment rate customer loan deferral requests the impact of government assistance programs and other developments have influenced net interest income results fhn is monitoring current economic trends and potential exposures closely capital risk management and adequacy there have been no significant changes to fhns capital management

of item to fhns annual report on form 10k for the year ended december liquidity risk management among other things alco focuses on liquidity management the funding of assets with liabilities of appropriate duration while mitigating the risk of unexpected cash needs alco and the board of directors have adopted a liquidity policy the objective of the liquidity policy is to ensure that fhn meets its cash and collateral obligations promptly in a costeffective manner and with the highest degree of reliability the maintenance of adequate levels of asset and liability liquidity should provide fhn with the ability to meet both expected and unexpected cash and collateral needs key liquidity ratios asset liquidity levels and the amount available from funding sources are reported to alco on a regular basis fhns liquidity policy establishes liquidity limits that are deemed appropriate for fhns risk profile in accordance with the liquidity policy alco manages fhns exposure to liquidity risk through a dynamic real time forecasting methodology base liquidity forecasts are reviewed by alco and are updated as financial conditions dictate in addition to the baseline liquidity reports robust stress testing of assumptions and funds availability are periodically reviewed fhn maintains a contingency funding plan that may be executed should unexpected difficulties arise in accessing funding that affects fhn the industry as a whole or both subject to market conditions and compliance with applicable regulatory requirements from time to time funds are available from a number of sources including the availableforsale securities portfolio dealer and commercial customer repurchase agreements access to the overnight and term federal f unds markets incremental borrowing capacity at the fhlb billion was available at june brokered deposits loan sales syndications and access to the federal reserve bank core deposits are a significant source of funding and have historically been a stable source of liquidity for banks generally core deposits represent funding from a financial institutions customer base which provide inexpensive predictable pricing the federal deposit insurance corporation insures these deposits to the extent authorized by law generally these limits are thousand per account owner for interest bearing and noninterest bearing accounts the ratio of total loans excludi ng loans hfs and restricted real estate loans to core deposits was percent on june compared to percent on december fhn also may use unsecured shortterm borrowings as a source of liquidity currently the largest concentration of unsecured borrowings is federal funds purchased from correspondent bank customers these funds are considered to be substantially more stable than funds purchased in the national broker markets for federal funds due to the long historical and reciprocal nature of banking services provided by fhn to these correspondent banks the remainder of fhns wholesale shortterm borrowings is securities sold under agreements to repurchase transactions accounted for as secured borrowings with regional bankings business customers or fixed incomes broker dealer counterparties both fhn and first horizon bank may access the debt markets in order to provide funding through the issuance of senior or subordinated unsecured debt subject to market conditions and compliance with applicable regulatory requirements in may fhn issued million of senior capital notes in april first horizon bank issued million of subordinated notes these subordinated notes qualify as tier capital for first horizon bank as well as fhn up to certain regulatory limits for minority interest capital instruments both fhn and first horizon bank have the ability to generate liquidity by issuing preferred equity and for fhn by issuing common equity subject to market conditions and compliance with applicable regulatory requirements in january fhn issued million of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock series a and in may fhn issued million of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock series e as of first horizon national corp 2q20 form 10q report june first horizon bank and subsidiaries had outstanding preferred shares of million which are reflected as noncontrolling interest on the consolidated condensed statements of condition parent company liquidity is primarily provided by cash flows stemming from dividends and interest payments collected from subsidiaries these sources of cash represent the primary sources of funds to pay cash dividends to shareholders and principal and interest to debt holders of fhn the amount paid to the parent company through first horizon bank common dividends is managed as part of fhns overall cash management process subject to applicable regulatory restrictions certain regulatory restrictions exist regarding the ability of first horizon bank to transfer funds to fhn in the form of cash common dividends loans or advances at any given time the pertinent portions of those regulatory restrictions allow first horizon bank to declare preferred or common dividends without prior regulatory approval in an aggregate amount equal to first horizon banks retained net income for the two most recent completed years plus the current year to date for any period first horizon banks retained net income generally is equal to first horizon banks regulatory net income reduced by the preferred and common dividends declared by first horizon bank applying the dividend restrictions imposed under applicable federal and state rules as outlined above the banks total amount available for dividends was million as of july additionally a capital conservation buffer of basis points above wellcapitalized levels equal to an extra percent above minimum levels must be maintained on the common equity tier tier capital and total capital ratios to avoid restrictions on dividends first h orizon bank declared and paid common dividends to the parent company in the amounts of million and million in first and third quarter and m illion in first horizon bank declared and paid preferred dividends in first and second quarter and each quarter of additionally first horizon bank declared preferred dividends in third quarter payable in october payment of a dividend to shareholders of fhn is dependent on several factors which are considered by the board these factors include fhns current and prospective capital liquidity and other needs applicable regulatory restrictions and also availability of funds to fhn through a dividend from first horizon bank fhn is subject to the capital conservation buffer requirements as described in the above paragraph for first horizon bank additionally banking regulators generally require insured banks and bank holding companies to pay cash dividends only out of current operating earnings consequently the decision of whether fhn will pay future dividends and the amount of dividends will be affected by current operating results fhn paid a cash dividend of per common share on july fhn paid cash dividends of per series a preferred share on july as well as per series b preferred share and per series c preferred share on august in addition in july the board approved cash dividends per share in the following amounts dividendshare record date payment date common stock preferred stock series a series c series d series e cash flows the consolidated condensed statements of cash flows provide information on cash flows from operating investing and financing activities for the six months ended june and the level of cash and cash equivalents decreased million during the first half of and million during the first half of net cash used by investing activities was billion in the first half of driven by an increase in interestbearing cash strong loan growth and a net increase in the afs securities portfolio as purchases outpaced proceeds from maturities and sales net cash used by operating activities was billion in the first half of primarily due to net cash outflows of million related to loans heldforsale as purchases and originations outpaced proceeds from sales and settlements and million related to an increase in derivatives partially offset by cash inflows of4305 million related to fixed income trading activities net cash provided in financing activities was billion in the first half of largely driven by an inflow of deposits proceeds from the issuance of million of senior notes million of subordinated notes and million of preferred stock somewhat offset by a decrease in shortterm borrowings primarily fhlb stock net cash used by investing activities was billion in the first half of largely driven by an increase in loan balances somewhat offset by a decrease in interestbearing cash and a net decrease in afs debt securities as maturities and sales outpaced purchases net cash provided by financing activities was million in the first half of primarily driven by an increase in other shortterm borrowings somewhat offset by a decrease in deposits share repurchases and cash dividends paid during the first half of the increase in shortterm borrowings was primarily the result of an increase in fhlb borrowings which fluctuate largely based on loan demand deposit levels and balance sheet funding strategies net cash provided by

outflows of million related to loans hfs negatively first horizon national corp 2q20 form 10q report impacted operating cash flows during the first half of as purchases of government guaranteed loans outpaced sales including the sale of approximately million upb of subprime consumer loans repurchase obligations offbalance sheet arrangements and other contractual obligations obligations from pre2009 mortgage businesses prior to september fhn originated loans through its pre2009 mortgage business primarily first lien home loans with the intention of selling them sales typically were effected either as nonrecourse whole loan sales or through nonrecourse proprietary securitizations conventional conforming singlefamily residential mortgage loans were sold predominately to two governmentsponsored entities or gses fannie mae and freddie mac also federally insured or guaranteed whole loans were pooled and payments to investors were guaranteed through ginnie mae many mortgage loan originations especially nonconforming mortgage loans were sold to investors or certificateholders predominantly through first horizon proprietary securitizations but also to a lesser extent through other whole loans sold to private nonagency purchasers fhn used only one trustee for all of its first horizon proprietary securitizations in addition to first horizon proprietary securitization and other whole loan sales activities fhn also originated and sometimes sold or securitized secondlien line of credit and governmentinsured mortgage loans from these pre2009 activities fhn has incurred substantial losses stemming from obligations to repurchase loans pay makewhole amounts or otherwise resolve claims that loans which fhn originated or fhns servicing of those loans were deficient in a manner for which fhn was liable many years ago fhn established a repurchase and foreclosure liability or reserve in connection with those claims fhn has settled many claims and the reserve is reduced each time a claim is settled as discussed in note contingencies and other disclosures fhns principal remaining exposures for those activities relate to i indemnification claims by underwriters loan purchasers and other parties which assert that fhnoriginated loans caused or contributed to losses which fhn is legally obliged to indemnify and ii indemnification or other claims related to fhns servicing of pre2009 mortgage loans servicing obligations fhns national servicing business was sold as part of the platform sale in a significant amount of mortgage servicing rights msr was sold at that time and a significant amount was retained the related servicing activities including foreclosure and loss mitigation practices not sold in were outsourced including a subservicing arrangement initiated in the subservicer in fourth quarter and first quarter fhn sold and transferred a substantial majority of its remaining servicing obligations and servicing assets including advances to the subservicer the servicing still retained by fhn is not significant and continues to be subserviced as servicer fhn had contractual obligations to the owners of the loans primarily gses and securitization trustees to handle billing custodial and other tasks related to each loan each subservicer undertook to perform those obligations on fhns behalf during the applicable subservicing period although fhn legally remained the servicer of record for those loans that were subserviced as mentioned in note contingencies and other disclosures fhn has received a notice of indemnification claims from its subservicer nationstar mortgage llc currently doing business as mr cooper the notice asserts several categories of indemnity obligations by fhn to nationstar in connection with mortgage loans under the subservicing arrangement and under the purchase transaction this matter currently is not in formal litigation but litigation in the future is possible repurchase accrual methodology fhns approach for determining the adequacy of the repurchase and foreclosure reserve has evolved sometimes substantially based on changes in information available repurchasemakewhole rates vary based on purchaser vintage and claim type for those loans repurchased or covered by a makewhole payment cumulative average loss severities range between and percent of the upb repurchase accrual approach in determining potential loss content claims are analyzed by purchaser vintage and claim type fhn considers various inputs including claim rate estimates historical average repurchase and loss severity rates mortgage insurance cancellations and mortgage insurance curtailment requests inputs are applied to claims in the active pipeline as well as to historical average inflows to estimate loss content related to potential future inflows management also evaluates the nature of claims from purchasers andor servicers of loans sold to determine if qualitative adjustments are appropriate repurchase and foreclosure liability the repurchase and foreclosure liability is comprised of accruals to cover estimated loss content in the active pipeline consisting of mortgage loan repurchase makewhole foreclosureservicing demands and certain related exposures estimated future inflows and estimated loss content related to certain known claims not currently first horizon national corp 2q20 form 10q report included in the active pipeline the liability contemplates repurchasemakewhole and damages obligations and estimates for probable incurred losses associated with loan populations excluded from the settlements with the gses as well as other whole loans sold mortgage insurance cancellations rescissions and loans included in bulk servicing sales effected prior to the settlements with the gses fhn compares the estimated probable incurred losses determined under the applicable loss estimation approaches for the respective periods with current reserve levels changes in the estimated required liability levels are recorded as necessary through the repurchase and foreclosure provi sion the repurchase and foreclosure liability decreased to million on june from million on december market uncertainties and prospective trends fhns future results could be affected both positively and negatively by several known trends key among those are changes in the us and global economy and outlook government actions affecting interest rates availability and the administration of stimulus relief for the economy additional impacts include how the pandemic affects fhns customers as well as political uncertainty potential changes in federal policies and the potential impact to our customers and fhns strategic initiatives fhns performance and the entire us financial services industry is affected considerably by the overall health of the us and global economy and outlook furthermore fhn may be directly or indirectly impacted by global events that impact clients and their businesses the global covid19 pandemic has led to periods of significant volatility in financial commodities including oil and gas and other markets and has adversely affected fhns and its clients ability to conduct normal business and could harm fhns business and future results of operations in march the federal reserve lowered shortterm interest rates twice and started a quantitative easing program intended to lower longerterm interest rates and foster access to credit the effective yields of 10year and 30year us treasury securities achieved record low rates and the us congress enacted relief legislation which among other things is intended to provide emergency credit to businesses at risk for failure from government and public actions related to the covid19 pandemic and to mitigate the severity of an economic recession these changes in interest rates and the volatility in the market are likely to negatively impact fhns net interest margin in the near term amortization of net processing fees related to government relief programs including the paycheck protection program ppp may offset a portion of the net interest margin decline the economic effects of the covid19 pandemic have significantly altered business in the us and globally leading to partial or full business closures individuals being furloughed or laid off significant increases in unemployment and workers being partially or wholly ordered to work from home disruption to fhns customers due to governmental and societal responses to covid19 are likely to adversely affect fhns loan and deposit fee income and could create downward loan migration and a corresponding increase in loan loss expense and reserves in addition loan chargeoffs likely will increase over time especially if economic disruption related to the covid19 pandemic continues for an extended period of time furthermore government programs under the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the cares act and other guidance intended to provide relief to customers through temporary modifications and deferrals may in some instances mask or postpone reporting of credit problems and potential defaults in these circumstances current credit quality indicators may not be reflective of the underlying health of fhns portfolios given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances it is difficult to predict the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the businesses of fhn for the remainder of or afterward in the chief executive of the united kingdom financial conduct authority which regulates the london interbank offered rate libor announced that it intends to halt persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after as a result libor as currently operated may not continue after fhn is not currently able to predict the impact that the transition from libor will have on the company however because fhn has instruments with floating rate terms based on libor fhn may experience increases in interest dividends and other costs relative to these instruments subsequent to additionally the transition from libor could impact or change fhns hedge accounting practices fhn has initiated efforts to develop an inventory of affected loans securities and derivatives evaluate and draft modifications as needed to address loans outstanding at the time of libor retirement obtain an understanding of the potential effects for applicable securities and derivatives and assess revisions to product pricing structures based on alternative reference rates in march the fasb issued asu facilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting which provides several optional expedients and exceptions to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform refer to the accounting changes issued but not currently effective section of note financial information for additional information additionally the irs has released a proposal that is intended to facilitate the first horizon national corp 2q20 form 10q report transition of existing contracts from libor to new reference rates without triggering modification accounting or taxable exchange treatment for those contracts this proposal contains specific guidance that must be met in order to qualify for the beneficial transition approach and fhn is considering this guidance in its transition plans fhn has prioritized expense discipline to include reducing or controlling certain expenses including realization of merger efficiencies enabling the investment into revenueproducing activities customerfacing technology and critical infrastructure fhn remains committed to organic growth through customer retention key hires targeted incentives and other traditional means under applicable accounting guidance fhn is required to record ibkcs loans at estimated fair value as of the closing date july in addition fhn is required to assess the current expected credit losses associated with ibkc loans that credit loss assessment will be separate from the fair value estimation and will result in a charge to fhns income for certain loans during third quarter fhn has not yet completed those estimations and assessments but currently expects that the associated charge to thirdquarter income will be substantial lastly while fhn has resolved most matters from the pre2009 mortgage business some remain unresolved the timing or financial impact of resolution of these matters cannot be predicted with accuracy accordingly the nonstrategic segment may occasionally and unexpectedly impact fhns overall quarterly results negatively or positively with reserve accruals or releases also although new pre2009 mortgage business matters of significance arise at a much slower pace than in years past and some formerly common legal claims no longer can be made due to the passage of time potential for new pre2009 mortgage business matters remains foreclosure practices fhn retains exposure for potential deficiencies in servicing related to its pre2009 mortgage servicing business and subservicing arrangements further details regarding these matters are provided in obligations from pre2009 mortgage businesses servicing obligations under repurchase obligations offbalance sheet arrangements and other contractual obligations fhn response to the covid19 pandemic as previously mentioned the covid19 pandemic has and will continue to directly and indirectly impact fhn and our customers fhn has adapted many operations to help ensure the health and safety of e mployees and customers during these uncertain times among other things fhn has implemented remote work policies encouraged contactless banking or inperson branch activities to be handled by appointment as well as additional sick time and child care assistance for employees loans fhn is actively monitoring the covid19 pandemic and its impact on customers and fhns credit quality fhn continues to reach out to customers to discuss challenges and solutions provide line draws and new extensions to existing customers provide support for small businesses through the ppp discussed in more detail below and other stimulus programs as well as provide lending and deposit assistance through deferrals and waived fees additionally in certain sectors fhn has reduced or stopped new lending paycheck protection program in congress created the foundation for a paycheck protection program ppp under the ppp qualifying businesses may receive loans from private lenders such as fhn that are fully guaranteed by the small business administration these loans potentially are partly or fully forgivable depending upon the borrowers use of the funds and maintenance of employment levels to the extent forgiven the borrower is relieved from payment while the lender still is paid from the program congress has revised the ppp this year and may make further revisions to ppp in the future lenders making ppp loans are paid a fee by the small business administration gross lender fees range from to of the loan amount a borrower can use an agent to assist in the preparation of their ppp applications with the costs of the agent potentially being paid from the gross lender fee additionally originating banks have certain internal costs of originating ppp loans fhn originated of ppp loans with an aggregate principal of billion through june for these loans fhn anticipates recognizing net lender fees of approximately million ppp lending has continued in third quarter but at lower volumes fhn has decided to hold its ppp loans for investment therefore the amount of sba fees net of total direct origination costs are deferred as a discount to the recorded carrying value of the ppp loans this discount is being amortized prospectively to interest income sba loan forgiveness payments are considered prepayments of the related loans under existing accounting principles amortization of net origination fees can reflect expected prepayment activity if prepayments are determined to be probable and both the timing and volume can be reasonably estimated based on the current terms of the ppp loans including the expected end of the payment deferral period fhn estimates that substantially all of the prepaymenteligible portions of ppp loans will be prepaid by second quarter as these loans are forgiven these estimated prepayments result in first horizon national corp 2q20 form 10q report a similar amount of the net fees being recognized in interest income since ppp loans carry a full sba guarantee they do not have any credit risk and will not affect the amount of provision and alll recorded fhn has assigned a risk weight of zero to ppp loans for regulatory capital purposes lending assistance for borrowers other customer support initiatives include incremental lending assistance for borrowers through delayed payment programs and fee waivers the following table provides the upb of loans related to deferrals granted to fhns customers that have been processed through june  in thousands as of june commercial general

been no significant changes to fhns critical accounting policies as described in critical accounting policies beginning on page of item to fhns annual report on form 10k for the year ended december allowance for loan losses managements policy is to maintain the alll at a level sufficient to absorb expected credit losses in the loan portfolio management performs periodic and systematic detailed reviews of its loan portfolio to identify trends and to assess the overall collectability of the loan portfolio management believes the accounting estimate related to the alll is a critical accounting estimate as changes in it can materially affect the provision for loan losses and net income it requires management to predict borrowers likelihood or capacity to repay including evaluation of inherently uncertain future economic conditions prepayment activity must be projected to estimate the life of loans that often are shorter than contractual terms it requires estimation of a reasonable and supportable forecast period for credit losses for loan portfolio segments before reversion to historical loss levels over the remaining life of a loan and expected future recoveries of amounts previously charged off must be estimated accordingly this is a highly subjective process and requires significant judgment since it is difficult to evaluate current and future economic conditions in relation to an overall credit cycle and estimate the timing and extent of loss events that are expected to occur prior to end of a loans estimated life the alll is increased by the provision for loan losses and recoveries and is decreased by chargedoff loans principal loan amounts are charged off against the alll in the period in which the loan or any portion of the loan is deemed to be uncollectible this critical accounting estimate applies to the regional banking nonstrategic and corporate segments a management committee comprised of representatives from risk management finance credit and treasury performs a quarterly review of the assumptions used in fhns alll analytical models makes qualitative assessments of the loan portfolio and determines if qualitative adjustments should be recommended to the modeled results on a quarterly basis as a part of enterprise risk reporting and discussion management addresses credit reserve adequacy and credit losses with the executive and risk committee of fhns board of directors first horizon national corp 2q20 form 10q report fhn believes that the critical assumptions underlying the accounting estimates made by management include the commercial loan portfolio has been properly risk graded based on information about borrowers in specific industries and specific issues with respect to single borrowers borrower specific information made available to fhn is current and accurate the loan portfolio has been segmented properly and individual loans have similar credit risk characteristics and will behave similarly the lives for loan portfolio pools have been estimated properly including consideration of expected prepayments the economic forecasts utilized in the modeling of expected credit losses are reflective of future economic conditions entityspecific historical loss information has been properly assessed for all loan portfolio segments as the initial basis for estimating expected credit losses the reasonable and supportable periods for loan portfolio segments have been properly determined the reversion methodologies and timeframes for migration from the reasonable and supportable period to the use of historical loss rates are reasonable expected recoveries of prior charge off amounts have been properly estimated and qualitative adjustments to modeled loss results reasonably reflect expected future credit losses as of the date of the financial statements while management uses the best information available to establish the alll future adjustments to the alll and methodology may be necessary if economic or other conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the estimates such adjustments to original estimates as necessary are made in the period in which these factors and other relevant considerations indicate that loss levels vary from previous estimates see note summary of significant accounting policies and note allowance for loan
