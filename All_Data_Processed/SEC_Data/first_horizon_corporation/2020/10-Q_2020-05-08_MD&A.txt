interest rates of basis points at all points on the interest rate yield curve up bps assumes an instantaneous upward move in interest rates of basis points at all points on the interest rate yield curve curve flattening assumes an instantaneous flattening of the interest rate yield curve through an increase in shortterm rates and a decrease in longterm rates the 2year point on the treasury yield curve is assumed to increase basis points and the 10year point on the treasury yield curve is assumed to decrease basis points shifts in other points on the yield curve are predicted based on their correlation to the 2year and 10year points curve steepening assumes an instantaneous steepening of the interest rate yield curve through a decrease in shortterm rates and an increase in longterm rates the 2year point on the treasury yield curve is assumed to decrease basis points and the 10year point on the treasury yield curve is assumed to increase basis points shifts in other points on the

model to measure interest rate risk and to formulate strategies to improve balance sheet positioning earnings or both within fhns interest rate risk liquidity and capital guidelines interest rate exposure is measured by forecasting months of nii under various interest rate scenarios and comparing the percentage change in nii for each scenario to a base case scenario where interest rates remain unchanged assumptions are made regarding future balance sheet composition interest rate movements and loan and deposit pricing in addition assumptions are made about the magnitude of asset prepayments and earlier than anticipated deposit withdrawals the results of these scenarios help fhn develop strategies for managing exposure to interest rate risk while management believes the assumptions used and scenarios selected in its simulations are reasonable simulation modeling provides only an estimate not a precise calculation of exposure to any given change in interest rates based on a static balance sheet as of march nii exposures over the next months assuming rate shocks of plus basis points basis points basis points and basis points are estimated to have favorable variances of percent percent percent and percent respectively compared to base nii a steepening yield curve scenario where longterm rates increase by basis points and shortterm rates are static results in a favorable nii variance of percent a flattening yield curve scenario where longterm rates decrease by basis points and shortterm rates are static results in an unfavorable nii variance of percent rate shocks of

transactions accounted for as secured borrowings with regional bankings business customers or fixed incomes broker dealer counterparties both fhn and first horizon bank may access the debt markets in order to provide funding through the issuance of senior or subordinated unsecured debt subject to market conditions and compliance with applicable regulatory requirements in april first horizon bank issued million of subordinated notes these subordinated notes qualify as tier capital for first horizon bank as well as fhn up to certain regulatory limits for minority interest capital instruments first horizon national corp 1q20 form 10q report both fhn and first horizon bank have the ability to generate liquidity by issuing preferred equity and for fhn by issuing common equity subject to market conditions and compliance with applicable regulatory requirements in january fhn issued million of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock series a as of march first horizon bank and subsidiaries had outstanding preferred shares of million which are reflected as noncontrolling interest on the consolidated condensed statements of condition parent company liquidity is primarily provided by cash flows stemming from dividends and interest payments collected from subsidiaries these sources of cash represent the primary sources of funds to pay cash dividends to shareholders and principal and interest to debt holders of fhn the amount paid to the parent company through first horizon bank common dividends is managed as part of fhns overall cash management process subject to applicable regulatory restrictions certain regulatory restrictions exist regarding the ability of first horizon bank to transfer funds to fhn in the form of cash common dividends loans or advances at any given time the pertinent portions of those regulatory restrictions allow first horizon bank to declare preferred or common dividends without prior regulatory approval in an aggregate amount equal to first horizon banks retained net income for the two most recent completed years plus the current year to date for any period first horizon banks retained net income generally is equal to first horizon banks regulatory net income reduced by the preferred and common dividends declared by first horizon bank applying the dividend restrictions imposed under applicable federal and state rules as outlined above the banks total amount available for dividends was million as of april additionally a capital conservation buffer of basis points above wellcapitalized levels equal to an extra percent above minimum levels must be maintained on the common equity tier tier capital and total capital ratios to avoid restrictions on dividends since the total capital ratio for first horizon bank fell slightly below the required buffer as of march these capital conservation buffer rules limit the amount of dividends that the bank can declare in second quarter to its sole common stockholder fhn or to its preferred shareholders without prior regulatory approval at million first horizon bank declared and paid common dividends to the parent company in the amount of million in first quarter and million in first horizon bank declared and paid preferred dividends in first quarter and each quarter of additionally first horizon bank declared preferred dividends in second quarter payable in july payment of a dividend to shareholders of fhn is dependent on several factors which are considered by the board these factors include fhns current and prospective capital liquidity and other needs applicable regulatory restrictions and also availability of funds to fhn through a dividend from first horizon bank fhn is subject to the capital conservation buffer requirements as described in the above paragraph for first horizon bank additionally banking regulators generally require insured banks and bank holding companies to pay cash dividends only out of current operating earnings consequently the decision of whether fhn will pay future dividends and the amount of dividends will be affected by current operating results fhn paid a cash dividend of per common share on april and in april the board approved a per common share cash dividend payable on july to shareholders of record on june fhn paid a cash dividend of per preferred share on april and in april the board approved

originated loans through its pre2009 mort gage business primarily first lien home loans with the intention of selling them sales typically were effected either as nonrecourse whole loan sales or through nonrecourse proprietary securitizations conventional conforming singlefamily residential mortgage loans were sold predominately to two governmentsponsored entities or gses fannie mae and freddie mac also federally insured or guaranteed whole loans were pooled and payments to investors were guaranteed through ginnie mae many mortgage loan originations especially nonconforming mortgage loans were sold to investors or certificateholders predominantly through first horizon proprietary securitizations but also to a lesser extent through other whole loans sold to private nonagency purchasers fhn used only one trustee for all of its first horizon proprietary securitizations in addition to first horizon proprietary securitization and other whole loan sales activities fhn also originated and sometimes sold or securitized secondlien line of credit and governmentinsured mortgage loans from these pre2009 activities fhn has incurred substantial losses stemming from obligations to repurchase loans pay makewhole amounts or otherwise resolve claims that loans which fhn originated or fhns servicing of those loans were deficient in a manner for which fhn was liable many years ago fhn established a repurchase and foreclosure liability or reserve in connection with those claims fhn has settled many claims and the reserve is reduced each time a claim is settled as discussed in note contingencies and other disclosures fhns principal remaining exposures for those activities relate to i indemnification claims by underwriters loan purchasers and other parties which assert that fhnoriginated loans caused or contributed to losses which fhn is legally obliged to indemnify and ii indemnification or other claims related to fhns servicing of pre2009 mortgage loans servicing obligations fhns national servicing business was sold as part of the platform sale in a significant amount of mortgage servicing rights msr was sold at that time and a significant amount was retained the related servicing activities including foreclosure and loss mitigation practices not sold in were outsourced including a subservicing arrangement initiated in the subservicer in fourth quarter and first quarter fhn sold and transferred a substantial majority of its remaining servicing obligations and servicing assets including advances to the subservicer the servicing still retained by fhn is not significant and continues to be subserviced as servicer fhn had contractual obligations to the owners of the loans primarily gses and securitization trustees to handle billing custodial and other tasks related to each loan each subservicer undertook to perform those obligations on fhns behalf during the applicable subservicing period although fhn legally remained the servicer of record for those loans that were subserviced as mentioned in note contingencies and other disclosures fhn has received a notice of indemnification claims from its subservicer nationstar mortgage llc currently doing business as mr cooper the notice asserts several categories of indemnity obligations by fhn to nationstar in connection with mortgage loans under the subservicing arrangement and under the purchase transaction this matter currently is not in formal litigation but litigation in the future is possible repurchase accrual methodology fhns approach for determining the adequacy of the repurchase and foreclosure reserve has evolved sometimes substantially based on changes in information available repurchasemakewhole rates vary based on purchaser vintage and claim type for those loans repurchased or covered by a makewhole payment cumulative average loss severities range between and percent of the upb repurchase accrual approach in determining potential loss content claims are analyzed by purchaser vintage and claim type fhn considers various inputs including claim rate estimates historical average repurchase and loss severity rates mortgage insurance cancellations and mortgage insurance curtailment requests inputs are applied to claims in the active pipeline as well as to historical average inflows to estimate loss content related to potential future inflows management also evaluates the nature of claims from purchasers andor servicers of loans sold to determine if qualitative adjustments are appropriate repurchase and foreclosure liability the repurchase

other whole loans sold mortgage insurance cancellations rescissions and loans included in bulk servicing sales effected prior to the settlements with the gses fhn compares the estimated probable incurred losses determined under the applicable loss estimation approaches for the respective periods with current reserve levels changes in the estimated required liability levels are recorded as necessary through the repurchase and foreclosure provision the repurchase and foreclosure liability decreased to million on march from million on december market uncertainties and prospective trends fhns future results could be affected both positively and negatively by several known trends key among those are changes in the us and global economy and outlook government actions affecting interest rates availability and the administration of stimulus relief for the economy and fhns customers related to the recent global covid19 pandemic political uncertainty potential changes in federal policies and the potential impact to our customers and fhns strategic initiatives in addition pre2009 mortgage business matters in the nonstrategic segment could continue to impact fhns quarterly results in ways which are both difficult to predict and unrelated to current operations performance by fhn and the entire us financial services industry is affected considerably by the overall health of the us and global economy and outlook furthermore fhn may be directly or indirectly impacted by global events that impact our customers and their businesses the recent global covid19 pandemic has led to periods of significant volatility in financial commodities including oil and gas and other markets has adversely affected fhns ability to conduct normal business has adversely affected fhn customers and is likely to harm fhns business and future results of operations in march the federal reserve lowered shortterm interest rates twice and started a quantitative easing program intended to lower longerterm interest rates and foster access to credit the effective yields of 10year and 30year us treasury securities achieved record low rates and the us congress enacted relief legislation which among other things is intended to provide emergency credit to businesses at risk for failure from government and public actions related to the covid19 pandemic and to mitigate an economic recession these changes in interest rates and the volatility in the market are likely to negatively impact fhns net interest margin in the near term amortization of net processing fees related to government relief programs including the paycheck protection program ppp may offset a portion of the net interest margin decline in addition credit spreads have widened for new loans wider spreads should help mitigate net interest margin compression however fhn will not be able to capture the widened spreads quickly for outstanding floatingrate loans the economic effects of the covid19 pandemic have significantly altered business in the us and globally leading to partial or full business closures individuals being furloughed or laid off significant increases in unemployment and workers being partially or wholly ordered to work from home disruption to fhns customers due to governmental and societal responses to covid19 are likely to adversely affect fhns loan and deposit fee income as well as create downward loan migration and a corresponding increase in loan loss expense and reserves in addition loan chargeoffs likely will increase over time especially if economic disruption related to covid19 continues for more than a few months furthermore government programs under the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the cares act and other guidance intended to provide relief to customers through temporary modifications and deferrals may in some instances mask or postpone reporting of credit problems and potential defaults in these circumstances current credit quality indicators may not be reflective of the underlying health of fhns portfolios given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances it is difficult to predict the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the businesses of fhn for the remainder of or afterward in the chief executive of the united kingdom financial conduct authority which regulates the london interbank offered rate libor announced that it intends to halt persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after as a result libor as currently operated may not continue after fhn is not currently able to predict the impact that the transition from libor will have on the company however because fhn has instruments with floating rate terms based on libor fhn may experience increases in interest dividends and other costs relative to these instruments subsequent to additionally the transition from libor could impact or change fhns hedge accounting practices fhn has initiated efforts to develop an inventory of affected loans securities and derivatives evaluate and draft modifications as needed to address loans outstanding at the time of libor retirement obtain an understanding of the potential first horizon national corp 1q20 form 10q report effects for applicable securities and derivatives and assess revisions to product pricing structures based on alternative reference rates in march the fasb issued asu facilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting which provides several optional expedients and exceptions to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform refer to the accounting changes issued but not currently effective section of note financial information for additional information additionally the irs has released a proposal that is intended to facilitate the transition of existing contracts from libor to new reference rates without triggering modification accounting or taxable exchange treatment for those contracts this proposal contains specific guidance that must be met in order to qualify for the beneficial transition approach and fhn is considering this guidance in its transition plans fhn has prioritized expense discipline to include reducing or controlling certain expenses including realization of expense efficiencies from its merger with cbf and investing in revenueproducing activities customerfacing technology and critical infrastructure fhn remains committed to organic growth through customer retention key hires targeted incentives and other traditional means when fhn closes its proposed merger with ibkc under applicable accounting guidance fhn will be required to record ibkcs loans at estimated fair value as of the closing date in addition fhn will be required to assess the current at that time expected credit losses associated with ibkc loans that credit loss assessment will be separate from the fair value estimation and will result in a charge to fhns income for certain loans for the period in which closing occurs fhn is not able make that assessment at this time but believes that the associated charge to income will be substantial to quarterly income lastly while fhn has resolved most matters from the pre2009 mortgage business some remain unresolved the timing or financial impact of resolution of these matters cannot be predicted with accuracy accordingly the nonstrategic segment may occasionally and unexpectedly impact fhns overall quarterly results negatively or positively with reserve accruals or releases also although new pre2009 mortgage business matters of significance arise at a much slower pace than in years past and some formerly common legal claims no longer can be made due to the passage of time potential for new pre2009 mortgage business matters remains foreclosure practices fhn retains exposure for potential deficiencies in servicing related to its pre2009 mortgage servicing business and subservicing arrangements further details regarding these matters are provided in obligations from pre2009 mortgage businesses servicing obligations under repurchase obligations offbalance sheet arrangements and other contractual obligations fhn response to the covid19 pandemic as previously mentioned the covid19 pandemic has and will continue to directly and indirectly impact fhn and our customers fhn has adapted many operations to help ensure the health and safety of employees and customers during these uncertain times among other things fhn has implemented remote work policies branch activities handled by appointment or via drivethrough only as well as additional sick time and child care assistance for employees additionally fhns foundation has donated million to support community relief efforts loans fhn is actively monitoring the covid19 pandemic and its impact on customers and fhns credit quality in response fhn is proactively reaching out to customers to discuss challenges and solutions is providing line draws and new extensions to existing customers is providing support for small businesses through the ppp discussed in more detail below and other stimulus programs as well as providing lending and deposit assistance through deferrals and waived fees additionally in certain sectors fhn has reduced or stopped new lending paycheck protection program on march the cares act was signed into law sections and of the cares act include a ppp that made billion of funds available for qualifying businesses to receive fullyguaranteed loans via the small business administrations section 7a lending program these loans are potentially fully forgivable depending upon the borrowers use of the funds and maintenance of employment levels ppp loans are intended to provide cashflow assistance to nonprofit and small business employers for expenses incurred between february and june generally the maximum loan amount per qualified borrower is the lesser of percent of average monthly payroll costs eg salaries and wages up to and benefits during the previous oneyear period plus the outstanding amount of any existing sba economic injury disaster loan made from january through april that is being refinanced under the ppp and million eligible borrowers include any of the following that were in operation on february businesses including nonprofit organizations under internal revenue code irc section 501c3 veterans organizations under irc section 501c19 and tribal organizations that first horizon national corp 1q20 form 10q report have or fewer employees or the small business administrations employeebased or revenuebased industry size standard if higher businesses in the food and accommodations industry as defined in naics with or fewer employees per location sole proprietors independent contractors and selfemployed individuals all ppp loans carry the same terms which are as follows fixed interest rate of percent per annum maturity date of two years with the ability to prepay earlier with no fees first payment deferred for six months waiver of credit elsewhere sba 7a requirement no collateral or personal guarantees required no borrower fees charged to obtain such loans under section of the cares act borrowers are eligible for forgiveness of principal and accrued interest on ppp loans to the extent that the proceeds are used to cover eligible payroll interest rent and utility costs over the eightweek period after the loan is made as long as the borrower retains its employees and their compensation levels however no more than percent of loan forgiveness may be attributable to eligible rent utilities and interest in addition loans qualifying for forgiveness will not be included in the borrowers taxable income lenders making these ppp loans are paid a fee by the small business administration on the date the loans are made lender fees are based on the following sliding scale loans and under loans greater than to million loans greater than million borrowers can use agents to assist in the preparation of their ppp applications those agents are paid from the sba fees received from the originating bank additionally originating banks have certain internal costs of originating ppp loans for applicable loans agent fees are paid by originating banks based on the following scale loans and under loans greater than to million loans greater than million the sba provides a percent guarantee on ppp loans which is an increase to the existing guarantee percentages under current sba loan programs in the event that a lender sells a ppp loan on the secondary market the guarantee will transfer with the loan lenders are not required to conduct any verification regarding loan forgiveness provided that a borrower submits documentation supporting its request for loan forgiveness and attests that it has accurately verified the eligibility of the expenditures made lenders will be held harmless if they rely on such documentation lenders must make a decision on the forgiveness within days section of the cares act indicates that any lender or purchaser of ppp loans may report to the sba an expected forgiveness amount and the sba will purchase the expected forgiveness amounts plus any interest accrued to date within days after such requests are received requests for forgiveness may occur as early as seven weeks after the loan is originated as part of fhns efforts to support customers through various stimulus programs fhn originated of ppp loans with an aggregate principal of billion in april for these loans fhn anticipates recognizing net origination fees of approximately to million additional lower origination volumes are anticipated in may fhn has decided to hold its ppp loans for investment therefore the net amount of sba fees and total direct origination costs are deferred as a discount to the recorded carrying value of the ppp loans this discount is being amortized prospectively to interest income sba loan forgiveness payments are considered prepayments of the related loans under existing accounting principles amortization of net origination fees can reflect expected prepayment activity if prepayments are determined to be probable and both the timing and volume can be reasonably estimated based on the terms of the ppp loans including the expected end of the payment deferral period fhn estimates that substantially all of the prepaymenteligible portions of ppp loans will be prepaid in as these loans are forgiven these estimated prepayments will result in a similar amount of the net fees being recognized in interest income in since ppp loans carry a full sba guarantee they do not have any credit risk and will not affect the amount of provision and alll recorded consistent with this view the cares act indicates that investors should assign a risk weight of zero to ppp loans for regulatory capital purposes the initial funding for the billion ppp loans was exhausted by april however on april an additional billion of funding was approved for the ppp these funds will likely be exhausted in early may first horizon national corp 1q20 form 10q report lending assistance for borrowers other customer support initiatives include incremental lending assistance for borrowers through delayed payment programs and fee waivers the following table provides the upb of loans related to deferrals granted to fhns customers that have been processed through april  in thousands as of april commercial general ci loans to mortgage companies trups income cre residential cre total commercial

million deposits deposit levels were also significantly impacted in april due to the impacts of covid19 pandemic which resulted in an increase in periodend deposits of billion or percent from march levels this increase was due to an increase in commercial deposits as fhn saw many firms deposit funds from lines of credit ppp loans operational revenues etc into noninterest bearing operating accounts in order to increase their liquidity positions additionally as various government stimulus programs were rolled out fhn saw increases in deposits from the healthcare industry as medicare reimbursements related to covid19 became available and a jump in deposits in correspondent banking due to stimulus and ppp funds deposited into client banks consumer deposit inflows were also impacted by approximately million in initial stimulus payments in midapril critical accounting policies except for the changes to the following allowance for loan losses section there have been no significant changes to fhns critical accounting policies as described in critical accounting policies beginning on page of item to fhns annual report on form 10k for the year ended december allowance for loan losses managements policy is to maintain the alll at a level sufficient to absorb expected credit losses in the loan portfolio management performs periodic and systematic detailed reviews of its loan portfolio to identify trends and to assess the overall collectability of the loan portfolio management believes the accounting estimate related to the alll is a critical accounting estimate as changes in it can materially affect the provision for loan losses and net income it requires management to predict borrowers likelihood or capacity to repay including evaluation of inherently uncertain future economic conditions prepayment activity must be projected to estimate of the life of loans that often are shorter than contractual terms it requires estimation of a reasonable and supportable forecast period for credit losses for loan portfolio segments before reversion to historical loss levels over the remaining life of a loan and expected future recoveries of amounts previously charged off must be estimated accordingly this is a highly subjective process and requires significant judgment since it is difficult to evaluate current and future economic conditions in relation to an overall credit cycle and estimate the timing and extent of loss events that are expected to occur prior to end of a loans estimated life the alll is increased by the provision for loan losses and recoveries and is decreased by chargedoff loans principal loan amounts are charged off against the alll in the period in which the loan or any portion of the loan is deemed to be uncollectible this critical accounting estimate applies to the regional banking nonstrategic and corporate segments a management committee comprised of representatives from risk management finance credit and treasury performs a quarterly review of the assumptions used in fhns alll analytical models makes qualitative assessments of the loan portfolio and determines if qualitative adjustments should be recommended to the modeled results on a quarterly basis as a part of enterprise risk reporting and discussion management addresses credit reserve adequacy and credit losses with the executive and risk committee of fhns board of directors fhn believes that the critical assumptions underlying the accounting estimates made by management include the commercial loan portfolio has been properly risk graded based on information about borrowers in specific industries and specific issues with respect to single borrowers borrower specific information made available to fhn is current and accurate the loan portfolio has been segmented properly and individual loans have similar credit risk characteristics and will behave similarly the lives for loan portfolio pools have been estimated properly including consideration of expected prepayments the economic forecasts utilized in the modeling of expected credit losses are reflective of future economic conditions entityspecific historical loss information has been properly assessed for all loan portfolio segments as the initial basis for estimating expected credit losses the reasonable and supportable periods for loan portfolio segments have been properly determined the reversion methodologies and timeframes for migration from the reasonable and supportable period to the use of historical loss rates are reasonable expected recoveries of prior charge off amounts have been properly estimated and qualitative adjustments to modeled loss results reasonably reflect expected future credit losses as of the date of the financial statements while management uses the best information available to establish the alll future adjustments to the alll and methodology may be necessary if economic or other conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the estimates such adjustments to original estimates as necessary are made in the period in which these factors and other relevant considerations indicate that loss levels vary from previous estimates see
