was reported in china and has since spread to most countries in the world including the united states starting in late february financial market volatility increased dramatically based on concerns that covid19 and the steps being undertaken in many countries to mitigate its spread would significantly disrupt economic activity in march financial market volatility increased further with several oneday stock market swings that resulted in significant market declines additionally in march market pricing deteriorated in virtually all sectors and asset classes except us treasury securities the world health organization declared covid19 to be a pandemic the us president declared the covid19 pandemic to be a national emergency allowing several federal disaster programs to be accessed by states and cities many states and cities in the us declared health emergencies lockdowns travel restrictions and quarantines prohibiting gatherings of more than a small number of people and ordering or urging most businesses and workplaces to close or operate on a very restricted basis the federal reserve lowered shortterm interest rates twice and started a quantitative easing program intended to lower longerterm interest rates and foster access to credit the effective yields of 10year and 30year us treasury securities achieved record low rates and the us congress enacted relief legislation which among other things is intended to provide emergency credit to businesses at risk for failure from government and public actions related to the covid19 pandemic and to mitigate an economic recession which has not been officially declared but is widely believed to have begun in march government programs instituted recently include loan programs administered by banks and other privatesector lenders liquidity programs administered by the us treasury and favorable accounting and regulatory treatment for lenders of certain loan payment deferrals the economic effects of these and related actions and events in the us have included large numbers of partial or full business closures large numbers of people being furloughed or laid off large increases in unemployment large numbers of workers being partially or wholly ordered to work from home large numbers of businesses at risk of insolvency as revenues drop off precipitously especially in businesses related to travel leisure and physical personal services large numbers of investors realizing substantial losses in their portfolios and retirement funds and large numbers of consumers being unwilling to undertake significant discretionary spending in addition worldwide demand for oil has fallen sharply in conjunction with the pandemic resulting in sharp drops in oil prices and sharp drops in the values of oilrelated assets further certain banking organizations globally have limited share buybacks and other capital actions the most significant effects already experienced by fhn and actions already taken by fhn are mentioned in part i item of this report under the captions financial summary income statement review asset quality and market uncertainties and prospective trends beginning on pages and of this report respectively given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances it is difficult to predict the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the businesses of fhn for the remainder of or afterward fhns efforts to mitigate first horizon national corp 1q20 form 10q report the adverse impacts of covid19 may not be effective and in any case are likely to be only a partial mitigate the full extent of impacts resulting from the covid19 pandemic and other events beyond the control of fhn will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and unpredictable including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the pandemic and further actions taken to prevent treat or mitigate the spread of covid19 among others moreover global markets for oil and gas have been and may continue to be severely impacted by events beyond the control of fhn the current low commodity prices especially if sustained could have a negative impact on the economies of several states in which fhn conducts business as well as fhns customers businesses and assets in those states in addition the covid19 pandemic could result in business disruption to fhn and if unable to recover from such a business disruption on a timely basis fhns businesses financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected the efforts to integrate the businesses of ibkc and those of fhn may also be delayed and adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic and become more costly fhn may also incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions which could adversely affect fhns financial condition and results of operations changes in interest rates due to federal reserve actions and market forces mentioned above are likely to negatively impact fhns net interest margin a measure of the average profit margin applicable to lending in addition spreads the difference between us treasury borrowing rates and private sector borrowing rates have widened for new loans wider spreads should help mitigate net interest margin compression however fhn will not be able to capture the widened spreads quickly for outstanding floatingrate loans for loans predating the covid19 crisis spreads are fixed by the loan contracts based on precovid pricing fhns customers have been adversely impacted by governmental and societal responses to covid19 those impacts are likely to adversely affect fhns noninterest income from loans and deposits as well as create downward loan migration a reduction in loangrading and a corresponding increase in loan loss provision expense and reserves in addition loan chargeoffs likely will increase over time especially if economic disruption related to covid19 continues for more than a few months in the us initial government responses to the covid19 pandemic were intended mainly to slow the spread of illness regardless of the impact on economic activity as governments relax restrictions in an effort reinvigorate the economy it is not clear how well or how quickly the economy will recover substantial uncertainty regarding covid19 and the resulting economic damage likely will continue until a substantial percentage of the population no longer fears contracting it
