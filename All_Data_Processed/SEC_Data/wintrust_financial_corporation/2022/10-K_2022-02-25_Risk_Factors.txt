item risk factors table end risk factors summary the summary of risks below provides an overview of the principal risks we are exposed to in the normal course of our business activities this summary does not contain all of the information provided in the detailed discussion of risks that follows this summary and should be read together with such detailed discussion risks related to economic

ability to originate certain mortgage loans or increase our risk of liability with respect to such loans regulatory initiatives regarding bank capital requirements that may require heightened capital

in federal and state tax laws and changes in the interpretation of existing laws changes in accounting policies or accounting standards and changes in us trade policies including the imposition of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs risks related to lending operations includes risks related to our allowance for credit losses and sufficiency to absorb losses that may occur in our loan portfolio litigation from the banks customers or other parties regarding the banks processing of loans for the sba paycheck protection program ppp and that the sba may not fund some or all ppp loan guaranties the repayment of commercial loans which are largely dependent upon the financial success and economic viability of the borrower our loan portfolio being secured by real estate in particular commercial real estate events impacting collateral consisting of real property any inaccurate assumptions in our analytical and forecasting models and environmental liability risk associated with lending activities risks related to our niche businesses includes risks related to our premium finance business which may involve a higher risk of delinquency or collection than our other lending operations widespread financial difficulties or credit downgrades among commercial and life insurance providers and exposure to certain risks associated with the securities industry risks related to financial strength and liquidity includes risks related to changes in prevailing interest rates our liquidity position an actual or perceived reduction in our financial strength our credit rating capital not being available when it is needed or the cost of that capital being very high disruption in the financial markets being a bank holding company and therefore being limited in sources of funds including to pay dividends and uncertainty about the transition from libor to alternate benchmark interest rates risks related to general operations includes risks related to our controls and procedures our operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of third parties security risks including denial of service attacks hacking social engineering attacks targeting our colleagues and customers malware intrusion and data corruption attempts the failures of vendors cybersecurity risks associated with debit cards and debit card transactions the accuracy and completeness of information we receive about table start table end our customers and counterparties to make credit decisions our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel losses incurred in connection with actual or projected repurchases and indemnification payments related to mortgages that we have sold into the secondary market and the occurrence of extraordinary events such as acts of war terrorist attacks natural disasters and public health threats risks related to ownership of our common stock antitakeover provisions could negatively impact our shareholders risk factors an investment in our securities is subject to risks inherent to our business certain material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect wintrust are described below before making an investment decision you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this annual report on s with the sec additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair wintrusts business operations this annual report on form 10k is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if this were to happen the value of our securities could decline significantly and you could lose all or part of your investment risks related to economic conditions and operating environment the covid19 pandemic is adversely affecting us and our customers employees and thirdparty service providers and the adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be material although the us and global economies have begun to recover from the covid19 pandemic as many health and safety restrictions have been lifted and vaccine distribution has increased certain adverse consequences of the pandemic continue to impact the macroeconomic environment and may persist for some time including labor shortages and disruptions of global supply chains the growth in economic activity and demand for goods and services alongside labor shortages and supply chain complications has also contributed to rising inflationary pressures all of our three primary business segments community banking specialty finance and wealth management have been uniquely impacted and we expect will continue to be impacted by the covid19 pandemic requiring the implementation of certain responses as circumstances evolve the extent to which the covid19 pandemic impacts our business results of operations and financial condition will depend on future development s which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict including but not limited to the rate of distribution and administration of vaccines globally the severity and duration of any resurgence of covid19 variants the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume in addition the covid19 pandemic may have the effect of heightening the other risks described in this item we have continued to maintain appropriate levels of our allowance for loan losses in response to the covid19 pandemic the effects of the pandemic could cause us to recognize heightened credit losses in our loan portfolio and additional increases in our allowance for loan losses certain portions of our lending portfolio are particularly vulnerable to the covid19 pandemic including commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans until the effects of the pandemic subside we could experience additional draws on lines of credit downward pressure on deposits and increased loan delinquencies the effects of covid19 may impair the value of collateral securing our loans especially commercial and residential real estate loans further a significantly larger amount of delinquent mortgage loans may result in us having to repurchase or substitute loans that we have sold in the secondary market market interest rates declined significantly during the pandemic but we expect that the temporary reduction of interest rates to near zero will be reversed with the federal reserve now signaling its concerns with respect to inflation and announcing that it will begin to taper its purchases of mortgage and other bonds the timing and impact of this expected reversal in interest rates trends is unknown the lower interest rate environment has negatively affected our interest rate margin and especially if prolonged could adversely affect our net interest income and profitability further the pandemic could cause us to recognize impairment of our goodwill and other financial assets may increase our cost of capital may prevent us from satisfying our minimum regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory requirements and could result in a downgrade in our credit ratings the negative economic conditions caused by the covid19 pandemic especially if prolonged may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations to protect the health and safety of our employees and communities many of our employees have been working remotely we may experience increased costs of operations or other operational difficulties including increased cybersecurity risk due to the remote working environments of our employees we may also experience additional operational risk due to difficulties table start table end experienced by our vendors the effects of the pandemic and measures taken in response may subject us to increased risk of litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances it is not possible to accurately predict the extent severity or duration of the pandemic or when normal economic and operating conditions will resume even after the pandemic has subsided we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of the viruss impact on the domestic and global economy accordingly the extent to which the covid19 pandemic may affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows including without limitation our liquidity regulatory capital ratios and credit ratings is highly uncertain unpredictable and depends on factors including among other things new information that may emerge regarding the covid19 pandemic the duration and severity of the pandemic the availability and efficacy of vaccines the emergence of variant strains of the virus and responses to the pandemic by the government businesses and consumers deterioration in economic conditions may materially adversely affect the financial services industry and our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows our business activities and earnings are affected by general business conditions in the united states and abroad including factors such as the level and volatility of shortterm and longterm interest rates inflation home prices unemployment and underemployment levels bankruptcies household income consumer spending fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets liquidity of the global financial markets the availability and cost of capital and credit investor sentiment and confidence in the financial markets and the strength of the domestic economies in which we operate the deterioration of any of these conditions can adversely affect our consumer and commercial businesses and securities portfolios our level of chargeoffs and provision for credit losses our capital levels and liquidity and our results of operations as a lending institution our business is directly affected by the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans as well as by the value of collateral such as real estate that secures many of our loans any economic deterioration from current levels or slowing of current economic activity could lead to an increase in loan chargeoffs and negatively affect consumer confidence as well as the level of business activity net chargeoffs totaled million in from million in our balance of nonperforming loans and other real estate owned oreo was million and million respectively at december compared to million and million respectively at december deterioration in the economy and real estate markets higher inflation rising interest rates or increased unemployment rates particularly in the markets in which we operate will likely diminish the ability of our borrowers to repay loans that we have made to them decrease the value of any collateral securing such loans and may cause increases in delinquencies problem assets chargeoffs and provision for credit losses all of which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations further the underwriting and credit monitoring policies and procedures that we have adopted may not prevent losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows since our business is concentrated in the chicago metropolitan and southern wisconsin market areas economic declines in the economy of this region could adversely affect our business except for our premium finance business and certain other niche businesses our success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the specific local markets in which we operate unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified we provide banking and financial services to customers primarily in the chicago metropolitan and southern wisconsin market areas the local economic conditions in these areas significantly impact the demand for our products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources in addition the state of illinois has experienced significant financial difficulty in recent years to the extent that these issues impact the economic vitality of the state and the businesses operating in illinois businesses may be encouraged to leave the state or new employers may be discouraged to start or move businesses to illinois which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations climate change manifesting as transition physical or other risks could adversely affect our operations businesses customers reputation and financial condition there is an increasing concern over the risks of climate change and related environmental sustainability matters the physical risks of climate change include discrete events such as flooding hurricanes tornadoes and wildfires and longerterm shifts in climate patterns such as extreme heat sea level rise and more frequent and prolonged drought such events could disrupt our operations or those of our customers or third parties on which we rely including through direct damage to assets and indirect impacts from supply chain disruption and market volatility additionally transitioning to a lowcarbon economy will entail table start table end extensive policy legal technology and market initiatives transition risks including changes in consumer preferences additional regulatory requirements or taxes and additional counterparty or customer requirements could increase our expenses undermine our strategies and impact our financial condition in addition our reputation and client relationships may be damaged as a result of our practices related to climate change including our involvement or our clients involvement in certain industries or projects associated with causing or exacerbating climate change as well as any decisions we make to continue to conduct or change our activities in response to considerations relating to climate change as climate risk is interconnected with all key risk types we have begun to develop and continue to enhance processes to embed climate risk considerations into our risk management strategies established for risks such as market credit and operational risks however because the timing and severity of climate change may not be predictable our risk management strategies may not be effective in mitigating climate risk exposure risks related to competition and reputation the financial services industry is very competitive and if we are not able to compete effectively we may lose market share and our business could suffer we face competition in attracting and retaining deposits making loans and providing other financial services including wealth management services throughout our market area our competitors include national regional and other community banks and a wide range of other financial institutions such as credit unions governmentsponsored enterprises mutual fund companies insurance companies factoring companies and other nonbank financial companies such as marketplace lenders and other financial technology fintech companies many of these competitors have substantially greater resources and market presence or more advanced technology than wintrust and as a result of their size may be able to offer a broader range of products and services better pricing for those products and services or newer technologies to deliver those products and services than we can several of our local competitors have experienced improvements in their financial condition over the past few years and are better positioned to compete for loans acquisitions and personnel the financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation for example the economic growth act and its implementing regulations significantly reduce the regulatory burden of certain large bhcs and raise the asset thresholds at which more onerous requirements apply which could cause certain large bhcs to become more competitive or to more aggressively pursue expansion also technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks such as mobile payment and other automatic transfer and payment systems and for banks that do not have a physical presence in our markets to compete for deposits the absence of regulatory requirements may give nonbank financial companies a competitive advantage over wintrust our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including among other things the ability to develop maintain and build upon longterm customer relationships based on top quality service and high ethical standards the scope relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands the ability to expand our market position the ability to uphold our reputation in the marketplace the rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors customer satisfaction with our level of service and industry and general economic trends if we are unable to compete effectively our market share and income from deposits loans and other products may be reduced this could adversely affect our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations damage to our reputation may harm our business maintaining trust in the company is critical to our ability to attract and maintain customers investors and employees if our reputation is damaged our business could be significantly harmed harm to our reputation could arise from numerous sources including among others employee misconduct security breaches compliance failures litigation or regulatory outcomes or governmental investigations our reputation could also be harmed by the failure or perceived failure of an affiliate or a vendor or other third party with which we do business to comply with laws or regulations in addition our reputation or prospects could be significantly damaged by adverse publicity or negative information regarding the company whether or not true that table start table end may be posted on social media nonmainstream news services or other parts of the internet and this risk can be magnified by the speed and pervasiveness with which information is disseminated through those channels actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members of or individuals in the industry can also affect our reputation for example the role played by financial services firms during and after the financial crisis including concerns that consumers have been treated unfairly by financial institutions or that a financial institution had acted inappropriately with respect to the methods employed in offering products to customers have damaged the reputation of the industry as a whole in addition increased focus on environmental social and governance esg issues including without limitation the impact of climate change could damage our reputation or prospects if customers prospective customers investors or third parties assigning esg ratings to the company are of the opinion that the companys practices including without limitation our lending practices are not sufficiently robust from an esg perspective should any of these or other events or factors that can undermine our reputation occur there is no assurance that the additional costs and expenses that we may need to incur to address the issues giving rise to the damage to our reputation would not adversely affect our earnings and results of operations or that damage to our reputation will not impair our ability to retain our existing customers and employees or attract new customers and employees harm to our reputation or the reputation of our industry may also result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny which may lead to changes in laws or regulations that could constrain our business or operations events that result in damage to our reputation may also increase our litigation risk consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions which could adversely affect our business and results of operations technology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks through alternative methods for example consumers can now maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts or mutual funds consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries could result in the loss of fee income as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits the loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may be adversely impacted by the soundness of other financial institutions financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including the federal home loan bank fhlb commercial banks brokers and dealers investment banks and other institutional clients many of these transactions expose us to credit risk as well as market and liquidity risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client in addition our credit risk may be exacerbated when collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount due to us any such losses could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations risks related to growth and acquisitions if we are unable to continue to identify favorable acquisitions or successfully integrate our acquisitions our growth may be limited and our results of operations could suffer in the past several years we have completed numerous acquisitions of banks other financial service related companies and financial service related assets including acquisitions of troubled financial institutions as more fully described below we expect to continue to make such acquisitions in the future wintrust seeks merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar have experienced management possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management economies of scale or expanded services failure to successfully identify and complete acquisitions may result in wintrust achieving slower growth the economic growth act could result in increased competition for merger or acquisition partners potentially resulting in higher acquisition prices or an inability to complete desired acquisitions in addition the standards by which bank and financial institution acquisitions will be evaluated are currently in flux and some banking organizations are experiencing delays in the processing of applications in july president biden issued an executive order on competition that requires the banking agencies to review the standards for bank mergers and the doj has announced that it is reviewing its bank merger guidelines it table start table end is expected that these reviews will tighten the standards for bank mergers and may change how the financial stability factor is evaluated in addition some members of congress have called for a moratorium of any bank merger and acquisition of greater than billion in assets while the company is still much smaller in asset size than billion we cannot exclude the possibility that we may be subject to higher antitrust standards enhanced scrutiny under the financial stability risk factor or have a potential acquisition denied acquiring other banks businesses or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions including among other things potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities or asset quality issues of the target company failure to adequately estimate the level of loan losses at the target company difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target company potential disruption to our business including diversion of our managements time and attention the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company difficulty in estimating the value of the target company and potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values and therefore some dilution of wintrusts tangible book value and net income per common share may occur as a result of any future acquisitions in addition certain acquisitions may expose us to additional regulatory risks including from foreign governments our ability to comply with any such regulations will impact the success of any such acquisitions furthermore failure to realize the expected revenue increases cost savings increases in geographic or product presence andor other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations new lines of business and new products and services are essential to our ability to compete but may subject us to additional risks we continually implement new lines of business and offer new products and services within existing lines of business to offer our customers a competitive array of products and services the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technologydriven products and services such as the rapid adoption of mobile payment platforms the effective use of technology can increase efficiency and enable financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs however some new technologies needed to compete effectively result in incremental operating costs our future success depends in part upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands as well as to create additional efficiencies in operations many of our competitors because of their larger size and available capital have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements we may not be able to effectively implement new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could cause a loss of customers and have a material adverse effect on our business at the same time there can be substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts particularly in instances where the markets for such services are still developing in developing and marketing new lines of business andor new products or services we may invest significant time and resources initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business andor new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible external factors such as compliance with regulations competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service furthermore any new line of business andor new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations de novo operations often involve significant expenses and delayed returns and may negatively impact wintrusts profitability our financial results have been and will continue to be impacted by our strategy of branch openings and de novo bank formations we expect to increase the opening of additional branches and may under certain circumstances resume de novo bank formations it may take longer than expected or more than the amount of time wintrust has historically experienced for new banks andor banking facilities to reach profitability and there can be no guarantee that these branches or banks will ever be profitable moreover the fdics enhanced supervisory period for de novo banks of three years including higher capital table start table end requirements during this period could also delay a new banks ability to contribute to the companys earnings and impact the companys willingness to expand through de novo bank formation to the extent we undertake additional de novo bank branch and business formations our level of reported net income return on average equity and return on average assets will be impacted by startup costs associated with such operations and it is likely to continue to experience the effects of higher expenses relative to operating income from the new operations these expenses may be higher than we expected or than our experience has shown which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations legal and regulatory risks if we fail to meet our regulatory capital ratios we may be forced to raise capital or sell assets as a banking institution we are subject to regulations that require us to maintain certain capital ratios such as the ratio of our tier capital to our riskbased assets and in recent years these regulatory and market expectations have increased substantially if our regulatory capital ratios decline as a result of decreases in the value of our loan portfolio or otherwise we may be required to improve such ratios by either raising additional capital or by disposing of assets if we choose to dispose of assets we cannot be certain that we will be able to do so at prices that we believe to be appropriate and our future operating results could be negatively affected if we choose to raise additional capital we may accomplish this by selling additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock which could significantly dilute the ownership percentage of holders of our common stock and cause the market price of our common stock to decline additionally events or circumstances in the capital markets generally may increase our capital costs and impair our ability to raise capital at any given time changes in the united states monetary policy may restrict our ability to conduct our business in a profitable manner our ability to profitably operate is dependent in part upon federal fiscal policies that cannot be predicted we are particularly affected by the monetary policies of the federal reserve which influence money supply in the united states any change in the united states monetary policy or worsening federal budgetary pressures could affect our access to capital additionally any trend toward inflation economic decline destabilizing of financial markets or other factors beyond our control may significantly affect consumer demand for our products and consumers ability to repay loans reducing our results of operations we cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary policies in response to the outbreak or in a response to what is being characterized as a current inflationary environment or the precise effects that future changes in monetary policies may have on our activities and financial results legislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future regarding the financial services industry may significantly increase our costs or limit our ability to conduct our business in a profitable manner we are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision the cost of compliance with such laws and regulations can be substantial and adversely affect our ability to operate profitably while we are unable to predict the scope or impact of any potential legislation or regulatory action until it becomes final it is possible that changes in applicable laws regulations or interpretations thereof could significantly increase our regulatory compliance costs impede the efficiency of our internal business processes negatively impact the recoverability of certain of our recorded assets require us to increase our regulatory capital interfere with our executive compensation plans or limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner including our plan for de novo growth and growth through acquisitions both the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which our business is subject have increased in recent years in response to the financial crisis as well as other factors such as technological and market changes for example as cybersecurity and data privacy risks for banking organizations and the broader financial system have significantly increased in recent years cybersecurity and data privacy issues have become the subject of increasing legislative and regulatory focus for example in june of the governor of california signed into law the ccpa the ccpa which became effective on january applies to forprofit businesses that conduct business in california and meet certain revenue or data collection thresholds for more information regarding data privacy laws and regulations see protection of client information under supervision and regulation in item regulatory enforcement and fines have also increased across the banking and financial services sector many of these changes have occurred as a result of the doddfrank act and its implementing regulations most of which are now in place we expect that our business will remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision table start table end in addition we expect that the biden administration and the democraticallycontrolled congress will continue to seek to implement a regulatory reform agenda that is significantly different than that of the trump administration this reform agenda could include a heightened focus on the regulation of loan portfolios and credit concentrations to borrowers impacted by climate change heightened scrutiny on bank secrecy act and antimoney laundering requirements topics related to social equity executive compensation and increased capital and liquidity as well as limits on share buybacks and dividends in addition mergers and acquisitions could be dampened by increased antitrust scrutiny we also expect reform proposals for the shortterm wholesale markets at this time we are unable to assess which if any of these policies would be implemented and what their impact on the companys business financial condition or results of operations would be financial reform legislation and increased regulatory rigor around consumer protection mortgagerelated issues may reduce our ability to market our products to consumers and may limit our ability to profitably operate our mortgage business the cfpb has broad rulemaking authority over a wide range of federal consumer protection laws applicable to the business of our subsidiary banks and some other operating subsidiaries including the authority to prohibit unfair deceptive or abusive acts and practices but examination and supervision of our subsidiary banks is carried out by the primary federal banking agency and where applicable the state banking agency consumer protection is an area of heightened regulatory focus and the cfpb has promulgated a number of specific regulatory requirements in this area these rules have increased and may further increase the costs of doing business for all market participants including our subsidiaries in particular the mortgagerelated rules issued by the cfpb have materially restructured the origination servicing and securitization of residential mortgages in the united states these rules have impacted and will continue to impact the business practices of mortgage lenders including the company for example in order to ensure compliance with mortgagerelated rules issued by the cfpb the company consolidated its consumer mortgage loan origination and loan servicing operations within wintrust mortgage in the wake of the mortgage crisis of the cfpb and federal and state banking agencies are closely examining the mortgage and mortgage servicing activities of depository financial institutions should these or other agencies have serious concerns with respect to our operations in this regard the effect of such concerns could have a material adverse effect on our profits federal state and local consumer lending laws may restrict our ability to originate certain mortgage loans or increase our risk of liability with respect to such loans and could increase our cost of doing business federal state and local laws have been adopted that are intended to eliminate certain lending practices considered predatory these laws prohibit practices such as steering borrowers away from more affordable products selling unnecessary insurance to borrowers repeatedly refinancing loans and making loans without a reasonable expectation that the borrowers will be able to repay the loans irrespective of the value of the underlying property the cfpb has promulgated many mortgagerelated rules since it was established under the doddfrank act including rules relating to the ability to repay loans and relating to qualified mortgage standards most of these mortgagerelated rules have been adopted although portions of certain of these rules have not yet become effective in addition several proposed revisions to mortgagerelated rules are pending finalization we may find it necessary to tighten our mortgage loan underwriting standards in response to the cfpb rules which may constrain our ability to make loans consistent with our business strategies it is our policy not to make predatory loans and to determine borrowers ability to repay but the law and related rules create the potential for increased liability with respect to our lending and loan investment activities they increase our cost of doing business and ultimately may prevent us from making certain loans and cause us to reduce the average percentage rate or the points and fees on loans that we do make in addition regulation related to redlining fair lending cra compliance and bsa compliance create significant burdens which necessitate increased costs any failure to comply with any of these regulations could have a significant impact on our ability to operate our ability to acquire or open new banks andor result in meaningful fines regulatory initiatives regarding bank capital requirements may require heightened capital the us basel iii rule as well as other aspects of current or proposed regulatory or legislative changes to laws applicable to banking organizations have increased our compliance costs impacted the profitability of our business activities and may change certain of our business practices including the ability to offer new products obtain financing attract deposits make loans and achieve satisfactory interest spreads and could expose us to additional costs including increased compliance costs these changes also may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes to table start table end operations in order to comply and could therefore also materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations our ability to engage in capital distributions including paying dividends or repurchasing stock may be restricted if we do not maintain the required capital conservation buffer in addition we anticipate that our pro forma capital ratios will be an important factor considered by the federal reserve in evaluating whether proposed payments of dividends or stock repurchases are consistent with its prudential expectations for more information regarding capital requirements see capital requirements of the company and subsidiary banks under supervision and regulation in item our fdic insurance premiums may increase which could negatively impact our results of operations insured institution failures leading up to and following the financial crisis as well as deterioration in banking and economic conditions significantly increased fdic loss provisions resulting in a decline of its deposit insurance fund to historical lows at the peak of the crisis in response the doddfrank act and fdic regulations changed the assessment base for federal deposit insurance from the amount of insured deposits to average total consolidated assets less average tangible capital eliminated the maximum size of the dif eliminated the requirement that the fdic pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds and increased the minimum reserve ratio of the dif from to these developments also caused our fdic insurance premiums to increase there is a risk that the banks deposit insurance premiums will increase in the future if failures of insured depository institutions once again deplete the dif any such increase may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations noncompliance with the usa patriot act bsa or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions the usa patriot act and the bsa require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering or the funding of terrorist activities if such activities are detected financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with fincen these rules require certain financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new accounts failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions an increasing number of banking institutions have received large fines for noncompliance with these laws and regulations although we have developed policies and procedures designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations no assurance can be given that these policies and procedures will be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations we are subject to claims and legal actions that could negatively affect our results of operations or financial condition periodically as a result of our normal course of business we are involved in claims and related litigation from our customers employees or other parties these claims and legal actions whether meritorious or not as well as reviews investigations and proceedings by governmental and selfregulatory agencies could involve large monetary claims and significant legal expense in addition such actions may negatively impact our reputation in the marketplace and lessen customer demand if such claims and legal actions are not decided in wintrusts favor our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted we are subject to examinations and challenges by tax authorities that may impact our financial results in the normal course of business we as well as our subsidiaries are routinely subject to examinations from federal and state tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due in connection with investments we have made and the businesses in which we have engaged recently federal and state tax authorities have become increasingly aggressive in challenging tax positions taken by financial institutions these tax positions may relate to among other things tax compliance sales and use franchise gross receipts payroll property and income tax issues including tax base apportionment and tax credit planning the challenges made by tax authorities may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions if any such challenges are made and are not resolved in our favor they could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations changes in federal and state tax laws and changes in interpretation of existing laws can impact our financial results the federal government enacted the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act on december and given the changing economic and political environment and ongoing budgetary pressures the enactment of further new federal or state tax legislation may occur the enactment of such legislation or changes in the interpretation of existing law including provisions table start table end impacting tax rates apportionment consolidation or combination income expenses credits and exemptions may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations changes in accounting policies or accounting standards could materially adversely affect how we report our financial results and financial condition our accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our financial results and financial condition some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results some of our accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions if such estimates or assumptions underlying our financial statements are incorrect we may experience material losses from time to time the fasb and the sec change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements these changes such as the cecl standard adopted on january can be hard to predict and could materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations in some cases we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in the restatement of prior period financial statements changes in us trade policies including the imposition of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs may adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations there continues to be discussion and dialogue in the us government regarding potential changes to us trade policies legislation treaties and tariffs including trade policies and tariffs affecting other countries including china the european union canada and mexico and retaliatory tariffs by such countries tariffs and retaliatory tariffs have been imposed and additional tariffs and retaliatory tariffs have been proposed such tariffs retaliatory tariffs or other trade restrictions on products and materials that our customers import or export could cause the prices of our customers products to increase which could reduce demand for such products or reduce our customers margins and adversely impact their revenues financial results and ability to service debt this in turn could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in addition to the extent changes in the political environment have a negative impact on us or on the markets in which we operate our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted it remains unclear what the us government or foreign governments will or will not do with respect to tariffs already imposed additional tariffs that may be imposed or international trade agreements and policies it is also unclear what changes if any to us trade policy will be made by the biden administration and congress particularly in light of the midterm elections in on october the united states canada and mexico agreed to a new trade deal the united statesmexicocanada agreement usmca to replace the north american free trade agreement on january thenpresident trump signed the usmca into law the full impact of the usmca on us our customers and on the economic conditions in the markets in which we operate is currently unknown changes to the terms upon which the united states mexico and canada trade could negatively affect our customers or the us economy or certain sectors thereof and thus adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations risks related to lending operations if our allowance for credit losses is not sufficient to absorb losses that may occur in our loan portfolio our financial condition and liquidity could suffer we maintain an allowance for credit losses that is intended to absorb expected lifetime credit losses related to our loan portfolio offbalance sheet credit exposures and heldtomaturity debt securities portfolio at each balance sheet date our management determines the amount of the allowance for credit losses based on our estimate of expected credit losses over the life of the related asset with consideration of historical credit losses current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts because our allowance for credit losses represents an estimate of lifetime losses there is no certainty that it will be adequate over time to cover credit losses in the portfolios particularly if there are changes in expectations of general economic or market conditions or events that adversely affect specific customers in we charged off million in loans net of recoveries and decreased our allowance for credit losses from million at december to million at december our allowance for loan and unfunded lendingrelated commitment losses represents and of total loans outstanding at december and respectively table start table end although we believe our allowance for credits losses is adequate to absorb estimated credit losses in our loan portfolio if our estimates are inaccurate and our actual credit losses exceed the amount that is anticipated or if the forecasts and assumptions used in calculating our reserves are significantly different from those we actually experience our financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected for more information regarding our allowance for loan losses see loan portfolio and asset quality under managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item as a participating lender in the sba paycheck protection program ppp the company and its banks are subject to additional risks of litigation from the banks customers or other parties regarding the banks processing of loans for the ppp and risks that the sba may not fund some or all ppp loan guaranties from april through the end of the program in the second quarter of we originated over ppp loans with a carrying balance totaling approximately billion as of december the carrying balance of such loans was reduced to approximately million primarily resulting from forgiveness by the sba the ppp program expired on may since the launch of the ppp several other larger banks have been subject to litigation regarding the process and procedures that such banks used in processing applications for the ppp as well as litigation regarding the alleged nonpayment of fees that may be due to certain agents who facilitated ppp loan applications although many of these lawsuits have subsequently been dismissed the company and the banks may be exposed to the risk of litigation from both customers and noncustomers that approached the banks regarding ppp loans regarding its process and procedures used in processing applications for the ppp if any such litigation is filed against the company or its banks and is not resolved in a manner favorable to the company or the banks such litigation may result in significant financial liability or adversely affect the companys reputation the company and one of its banks were named as defendants in a putative class action which has been dismissed with prejudice regarding the alleged nonpayment of agency fees regardless of outcome litigation can be costly and divert the companys attention and resources any financial liability litigation costs or reputational damage caused by ppp related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations ppp loans are fixed low interest rate loans that are guaranteed by the sba and subject to numerous other regulatory requirements and a borrower may apply to have all or a portion of the loan forgiven if ppp borrowers fail to qualify for loan forgiveness banks face a heightened risk of holding these loans at unfavorable interest rates for an extended period of time while the ppp loans are guaranteed by the sba various regulatory requirements will apply to banks ability to seek recourse under the guarantees and related procedures are subject to uncertainty participating banks also have credit risk with respect to ppp loans if a determination is made by the sba that there is a deficiency in the manner in which the loan was originated funded or serviced by the banks such as an issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive a ppp loan which may or may not be related to the ambiguity in the laws rules and guidance regarding the operation of the ppp in the event of a loss resulting from a default on a ppp loan and a determination by the sba that there was a deficiency in the manner in which a ppp loan was originated funded or serviced by the company the sba may deny its liability under the guaranty reduce the amount of the guaranty or if it has already paid under the guaranty seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from the company a significant portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of commercial loans the repayment of which is largely dependent upon the financial success and economic viability of the borrower the repayment of our commercial loans is dependent upon the financial success and viability of the borrower if the economy weakens for a prolonged period or experiences deterioration or if the industry or market in which the borrower operates weakens our borrowers may experience depressed or dramatic and sudden decreases in revenues that could hinder their ability to repay their loans excluding ppp loans that include a guarantee from the sba our commercial loan portfolio totaled billion or of our total loan portfolio at december compared to billion or of our total loan portfolio at december commercial loans are secured by different types of collateral related to the underlying business such as accounts receivable inventory and equipment should a commercial loan require us to foreclose on the underlying collateral the unique nature of the collateral may make it more difficult and costly to liquidate thereby increasing the risk to us of not recovering the principal table start table end amount of the loan accordingly our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected by defaults in this portfolio a substantial portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate in particular commercial real estate deterioration in the real estate markets could lead to additional losses which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations as of both december and approximately and respectively of our total loan portfolio was secured by real estate the majority of which is commercial real estate the commercial and residential real estate market continues to experience a variety of difficulties including the chicago metropolitan area and southern wisconsin in which a majority of our real estate loans are concentrated increases in commercial and consumer delinquency levels or declines in real estate market values would require increased net chargeoffs and increases in the allowance for loan and lease losses which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations events impacting collateral consisting of real property could lead to additional losses which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations many of the loans in our portfolio are secured by real estate located in the chicago metropolitan area any declines in economic conditions including inflation recession unemployment changes in securities markets or other factors impacting these local markets could in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations deterioration in the real estate markets where collateral for our mortgage loans is located could adversely affect the borrowers ability to repay the loan and the value of the collateral securing the loan and in turn the value of our assets in addition any natural disasters or severe weather events have the potential to damage our real estate collateral climate change could have an impact on longerterm natural weather trends and increase the occurrence and severity of such adverse weather events any inaccurate assumptions in our analytical and forecasting models could cause us to miscalculate our projected revenue capital liquidity or losses which could adversely affect our financial condition we use analytical and forecasting models to estimate the effects of economic conditions on our loan portfolio and probable loan performance those models reflect certain assumptions about market forces including interest rates and consumer behavior that may be incorrect if our analytical and forecasting models underlying assumptions are incorrect improperly applied or otherwise inadequate we may suffer deleterious effects such as higher than expected loan losses lower than expected net interest income lower than expected liquidity lower than expected capital or unanticipated chargeoffs any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities a significant portion of the companys loan portfolio is secured by real property in the ordinary course of business the company may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans in doing so there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties if hazardous or toxic substances are found the company may be liable for remediation costs as well as for personal injury and property damage in addition we own and operate a number of properties that may be subject to similar environmental liability risks environmental laws may require the company to incur substantial expenses and could materially reduce the affected propertys value or limit the companys ability to use or sell the affected property the costs associated with investigation and remediation activities could be substantial in addition if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property although the company has policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on real property these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards the remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on the companys business financial condition and results of operations risks related to our niche businesses our premium finance business may involve a higher risk of delinquency or collection than our other lending operations and could expose us to losses table start table end we provide financing for the payment of property and casualty insurance premiums and life insurance premiums on a national basis through first insurance funding and wintrust life finance respectively and financing for the payment of property and casualty insurance premiums in canada through our whollyowned subsidiary fifc canada property and casualty insurance premium finance loans involve a different and possibly higher risk of delinquency or collection than life insurance premium finance loans and the loan portfolios of our bank subsidiaries because these loans are issued primarily through relationships with a large number of unaffiliated insurance agents and because the borrowers are located nationwide as a result risk management and general supervisory oversight may be difficult as of december we had billion of property and casualty insurance premium finance loans outstanding of which billion related to the companys us operations at first insurance funding and million related to the companys canadian operations at fifc canada together these loans represented of our total loan portfolio as of such date first insurance funding and fifc canada may also be more susceptible to third party fraud with respect to property and casualty insurance premium finance loans because these loans are originated and many times funded through relationships with unaffiliated insurance agents and brokers in the second quarter of for example fraud perpetrated against a number of premium finance companies in the industry including the property and casualty division of first insurance funding increased both the companys net chargeoffs and provision for credit losses by million acts of fraud are difficult to detect and deter and we cannot assure investors that our risk management procedures and controls will prevent losses from fraudulent activity wintrust life finance may be exposed to the risk of loss in our life insurance premium finance business because of fraud while wintrust life finance maintains a policy prohibiting the known financing of strangeroriginated life insurance and has established procedures to identify and prevent the company from financing such policies wintrust life finance cannot be certain that it will never provide loans with respect to such a policy in the event such policies were financed a carrier could potentially put at risk the cash surrender value of a policy which serves as wintrust life finances primary collateral by challenging the validity of the insurance contract for lack of an insurable interest see the below risk factor widespread financial difficulties or credit downgrades among commercial and life insurance providers could lessen the value of the collateral securing our premium finance loans and impair the financial condition and liquidity of first insurance funding wintrust life finance and fifc canada for a discussion of further risks associated with our insurance premium finance activities while first insurance funding and wintrust life finance are licensed as required and carefully monitor compliance with regulation of each of their businesses there can be no assurance that either will not be negatively impacted by material changes in the regulatory environment fifc canada is not required to be licensed in most provinces of canada but there can be no assurance that future regulations which impact the business of fifc canada will not be enacted additionally to the extent that affiliates of insurance carriers banks and other lending institutions add greater service and flexibility to their financing practices in the future our competitive position and results of operations could be adversely affected wintrust life finances life insurance premium finance business could be materially negatively impacted by changes in the federal or state estate tax provisions there can be no assurance that first insurance funding and wintrust life finance will be able to continue to compete successfully in its markets widespread financial difficulties or credit downgrades among commercial and life insurance providers could lessen the value of the collateral securing our premium finance loans and impair the financial condition and liquidity of first insurance funding wintrust life finance and fifc canada first insurance funding wintrust life finance and fifc canadas premium finance loans are primarily secured by the insurance policies financed by the loans these insurance policies are written by a large number of insurance companies geographically dispersed throughout the country our premium finance receivables balances finance insurance policies that are spread among a large number of insurers however the top three insurers represents approximately and of such balances first insurance funding wintrust life finance and fifc canada consistently monitor carrier ratings and financial performance of our carriers while first insurance funding wintrust life finance and fifc canada can mitigate its risks as a result of this monitoring to the extent that commercial or life insurance providers experience widespread difficulties or credit downgrades the value of our collateral will be reduced first insurance funding wintrust life finance and fifc canada are also subject to the possibility of insolvency of insurance carriers in the commercial and life insurance businesses that are in possession of our collateral if one or more large nationwide insurers were to fail the value of our portfolio could be significantly negatively impacted a significant downgrade in the value of the collateral supporting our premium finance table start table end business could impair our ability to create liquidity for this business which in turn could negatively impact our ability to expand our wealth management business in general and wintrust investments brokerage operation in particular exposes us to certain risks associated with the securities industry our wealth management business in general and wintrust investments brokerage operations in particular present special risks not borne by community banks that focus exclusively on community banking for example the brokerage industry is subject to fluctuations in the stock market that may have a significant adverse impact on transaction fees customer activity and investment portfolio gains and losses likewise additional or modified regulations may adversely affect our wealth management operations each of our wealth management operations is dependent on a small number of professionals whose departure could result in the loss of a significant number of customer accounts a significant decline in fees and commissions or trading losses suffered in the investment portfolio could adversely affect our results of operations in addition we are subject to claim arbitration risk arising from customers who claim their investments were not suitable or that their portfolios were inappropriately traded these risks increase when the market as a whole declines the risks associated with retail brokerage may not be supported by the income generated by our wealth management operations risks related to financial strength and liquidity changes in prevailing interest rates could adversely affect our net interest income which is our largest source of income we are exposed to interest rate risk in our core banking activities of lending and deposit taking since changes in prevailing interest rates affect the value of our assets and liabilities such changes may adversely affect our net interest income which is the difference between interest income and interest expense our net interest income is affected by the fact that assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change net interest income represents our largest component of net income and was billion and billion for the years ended december and respectively each of our businesses may be affected differently by a given change in interest rates for example we expect that the results of our mortgage banking business in selling loans into the secondary market could be negatively impacted during periods of rising interest rates whereas falling interest rates could have a negative impact on the net interest spread earned on deposits as we would be unable to lower the rates on many interest bearing deposit accounts of our customers to the same extent as many of our higher yielding asset classes additionally increases in interest rates may adversely influence the growth rate of loans and deposits the quality of our loan portfolio loan and deposit pricing the volume of loan originations in our mortgage banking business and the value that we can recognize on the sale of mortgage loans in the secondary market in response to the economic consequences of the covid19 pandemic the federal reserve lowered its target for the federal funds rate to a range of to while interest rates remain low the federal reserve is expected to begin raising interest rates during we cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary policies or the precise effects that they may have on our activities and financial results we seek to mitigate our interest rate risk through several strategies which may not be successful with the relatively low interest rates that prevailed in recent years we were able to augment the total return of our investment securities portfolio by selling call options on fixedincome securities that we own we recorded fee income of approximately million million and million for the years ended december and respectively we also mitigate our interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swaps and other interest rate derivative contracts from time to time with counterparties to the extent that the market value of any derivative contract moves to a negative market value we are subject to loss if the counterparty defaults in the future there can be no assurance that such mitigation strategies will be available or successful or that we will be successful in implementing any new mitigation strategies necessary to address the current rising interest rate environment in addition transactions entered into as part of mitigation strategies employed to mitigate risks associated with a prolonged low interest rate environment could be less beneficial or result in losses if interest rates continue to rise our liquidity position may be negatively impacted if economic conditions do not improve or if they decline liquidity is a measure of whether our cash flows and liquid assets are sufficient to satisfy current and future financial obligations such as demand for loans deposit withdrawals and operating costs our liquidity position is affected by a number of factors including the amount of cash and other liquid assets on hand payment of interest and dividends on debt and equity table start table end instruments that we have issued capital we inject into our bank subsidiaries proceeds we raise through the issuance of securities our ability to draw upon our revolving credit facility and dividends received from our banking subsidiaries our future liquidity position may be adversely affected by multiple factors including if our banking subsidiaries report net losses or their earnings are weak relative to our cash flow needs if it is necessary for us to make capital injections to our banking subsidiaries if changes in regulations require us to maintain a greater level of capital as more fully described below if we are unable to access our revolving credit facility due to a failure to satisfy financial and other covenants or if we are unable to raise additional capital on terms that are satisfactory to us weakness or worsening of the economy real estate markets or unemployment levels may increase the likelihood that one or more of these events will occur if our liquidity is adversely affected it may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition an actual or perceived reduction in our financial strength may cause others to reduce or cease doing business with us which could result in a decrease in our net interest income and fee revenues our customers rely upon our financial strength and stability and evaluate the risks of doing business with us if we experience diminished financial strength or stability actual or perceived including due to market or regulatory developments announced or rumored business developments or results of operations or a decline in stock price customers may withdraw their deposits or otherwise seek services from other banking institutions and prospective customers may select other service providers the risk that we may be perceived as less creditworthy relative to other market participants is increased in the current market environment where the consolidation of financial institutions including major global financial institutions is resulting in a smaller number of much larger counterparties and competitors as our community banks become more closely identified with the wintrust name the impact of any perceived weakness or creditworthiness at either the holding company or our community banks may be greater than in prior periods if customers reduce their deposits with us or select other service providers for all or a portion of the services that we provide them net interest income and fee revenues will decrease accordingly and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations if our credit rating is lowered our financing costs could increase as of december we have been rated by fitch ratings as bbb and dbrs as a low a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization our creditworthiness is not fixed and should be expected to change over time as a result of company performance and industry conditions we cannot give any assurances that our credit ratings will remain at current levels and it is possible that our ratings could be lowered or withdrawn by fitch ratings or dbrs any actual or threatened downgrade or withdrawal of our credit rating could affect our perception in the marketplace and our ability to raise capital and could increase our debt financing costs if our growth requires us to raise additional capital that capital may not be available when it is needed or the cost of that capital may be very high we are required by regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations see risks related to our regulatory environment if we fail to meet our regulatory capital ratios we may be forced to raise capital or sell assets and as we grow internally and through acquisitions the amount of capital required to support our operations grows as well we may need to raise additional capital to support continued growth both internally and through acquisitions any capital we obtain may result in the dilution of the interests of existing holders of our common stock our ability to raise additional capital if needed will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time which are outside our control and on our financial condition and performance if we cannot raise additional capital when needed or on terms acceptable to us our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be materially impaired and our financial condition and liquidity could be materially and negatively affected disruption in the financial markets could result in lower fair values for our investment securities portfolio table start table end the companys availableforsale debt and trading securities as well as certain equity securities are carried at fair value accounting standards require the company to categorize these securities according to a fair value hierarchy as of december approximately of the companys availableforsale debt securities and equity securities with a readily determinable fair value were categorized in level or of the fair value hierarchy meaning that their fair values were determined by unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets quoted prices for similar assets or other observable inputs significant prolonged reduced investor demand could manifest itself in lower fair values for these securities and may result in recognition of an otherthantemporary or permanent impairment of availableforsale debt securities and unrealized losses of equity securities with a readily determinable fair value recognized in earnings which could lead to accounting charges and have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition and results of operations the remaining securities in our availableforsale debt securities and equity securities with a readily determinable fair value portfolios were categorized as level meaning that their fair values were determined by inputs that are unobservable in the market and therefore require a greater degree of management judgment the determination of fair value for securities categorized in level involves significant judgment due to the complexity of factors contributing to the valuation many of which are not readily observable in the market in addition the nature of the business of the third party source that is valuing the securities at any given time could impact the valuation of the securities consequently the ultimate sales price for any of these securities could vary significantly from the recorded fair value at december especially if the security is sold during a period of illiquidity or market disruption or as part of a large block of securities under a forced transaction there can be no assurance that decline in market value of availableforsale debt securities and equity securities with a readily determinable fair value associated with these disruptions will not result in credit or permanent impairments and unrealized losses respectively of these assets which would lead to accounting charges which could have a material negative effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we are a bank holding company and our sources of funds including to pay dividends are limited we are a bank holding company and our operations are primarily conducted by and through our operating banks which are subject to significant federal and state regulation cash available to pay dividends to our shareholders repurchase our shares or repay our indebtedness is derived primarily from dividends received from our banks and our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries is restricted various statutory provisions restrict the amount of dividends our banks can pay to us without regulatory approval the banks may not pay cash dividends if that payment could reduce the amount of their capital below that necessary to meet the adequately capitalized level in accordance with regulatory capital requirements it is also possible that depending upon the financial condition of the banks and other factors regulatory authorities could conclude that payment of dividends or other payments including payments to us is an unsafe or unsound practice and impose restrictions or prohibit such payments our inability to receive dividends from our banks could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations uncertainty about the future of libor may adversely affect our business we have derivative contracts borrowings variable rate loans and other financial instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on the libor central banks around the world including the federal reserve have commissioned committees and working groups of market participants and official sector representatives to replace libor and replace or reform other interest rate benchmarks the publication of most libor rates ceased as of the end of december while certain us dollar libor tenors are expected to continue to be published until june the us banking agencies have encouraged banks to cease entering into new contracts referencing libor no later than december a transition away from the widespread use of libor to alternative rates and other potential interest rate benchmark reforms has begun and will continue over the course of the next few years these reforms may cause such rates to perform differently than in the past or to disappear entirely or have other consequences which cannot be predicted while there is no consensus on what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to libor a group of market participants convened by the federal reserve the alternative reference rate committee arrc has selected the secured overnight financing rate sofr as its recommended alternative to libor sofr is a broad measure of the cost of overnight borrowings collateralized by treasury securities that was selected due to the depth and robustness of the us treasury repurchase market at this time it is impossible to predict whether sofr will become an accepted alternative to libor further the bank of england has commenced publication of a reformed sterling overnight index average reformed sonia comprised of a broader set of overnight sterling money market transactions as of april reformed sonia has been recommended as the alternative to sterling libor by the working group on sterling riskfree reference rates table start table end although sofr appears to be the preferred replacement rate for us dollar libor it is unclear if other benchmarks may emerge or if other rates will be adopted outside of the united states we cannot predict what effect any such alternatives will have on the value of liborbased securities or financial arrangements including the companys series d preferred stock junior subordinated debentures or other securities or financial arrangements given libors role in determining market interest rates globally uncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates and as to potential changes or other reforms to libor may adversely affect libor rates and other interest rates in the event that a published libor rate is unavailable after the dividend rate on the companys series d preferred stock which currently is based on the libor rate will be determined as set forth in the accompanying offering documents and the value of such securities may be adversely affected we anticipate significant operational challenges for the transition away from libor including but not limited to amending existing loan agreements with borrowers on loans that may have not been modified with fallback language and adding effective fallback language to new agreements in the event that libor is discontinued before maturity in addition the transition away from libor could prompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect of the companys preparation and readiness for the replacement of libor with an alternative reference rate as well as result in disputes litigation or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in liborbased contracts and securities currently the manner and impact of this transition and related developments as well as the effect of these developments on our funding costs loan derivative and investment portfolios assetliability management and business is uncertain risks related to general operations our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls over financial reporting disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures any system of controls however welldesigned and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system are met any circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition our operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of third parties could fail or be breached which could disrupt our business and adversely impact our results of operations liquidity and financial condition as well as cause legal or reputational harm the potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout our business and as a result of our interactions with and reliance on third parties is not limited to our own internal operational functions our operational and security systems and infrastructure including our computer systems data management and internal processes as well as those of third parties are integral to our performance we rely on our employees and third parties in our daytoday and ongoing operations who may as a result of human error misconduct malfeasance or failure or breach of our or of thirdparty systems or infrastructure expose us to risk for example our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to us or to third parties with whom we interact or upon whom we rely in addition our ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to thirdparty systems is more limited than with respect to our own systems our financial accounting data processing backup or other operating or security systems and infrastructure may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control which could adversely affect our ability to process transactions or provide services such events may include sudden increases in customer transaction volume electrical telecommunications or other major physical infrastructure outages natural disasters such as earthquakes tornadoes hurricanes and floods disease pandemics and events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters including wars and terrorist acts in addition we may need to take our systems offline if they become infected with malware or a computer virus or as a result of another form of cyberattack in the event that backup systems are utilized they may not process data as quickly as our primary systems and some data might not have been saved to backup systems potentially resulting in a temporary or permanent loss of such data we frequently update our systems to support our operations and growth and to remain compliant with all applicable laws rules and regulations this updating entails significant costs and creates risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones including business interruptions implementation and testing of controls related to our computer systems security monitoring and retaining and training personnel required to operate our systems also entail significant costs operational risk exposures could adversely impact our results of operations liquidity and financial condition as well as cause reputational harm in addition we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption table start table end we face security risks including denial of service attacks hacking social engineering attacks targeting our colleagues and customers malware intrusion and data corruption attempts in addition to the resulting identity theft that could result in the disclosure of confidential information all of which could adversely affect our business or reputation and create significant legal and financial exposure our computer systems and network infrastructure and those of third parties on which we are highly dependent are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyberattacks such as denial of service attacks hacking terrorist activities or identity theft our business relies on the secure processing transmission storage and retrieval of confidential personal proprietary and other information in our computer and data management systems and networks and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties in addition to access our network products and services our customers and other third parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of our network environment and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks we our customers regulators and other third parties including other financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have been subject to and are likely to continue to be the target of cyberattacks these cyberattacks include computer viruses malicious or destructive code phishing attacks denial of service or information ransomware improper access by employees or vendors attacks on personal email of employees ransom demands to not expose security vulnerabilities in our systems or the systems of third parties or other security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of confidential proprietary and other information of ours our employees our customers or of third parties damage to our systems or other material disruption of our or our customers or other third parties network access or business operations as cyber threats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents despite efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and implement controls processes policies and other protective measures we may not be able to anticipate all security breaches nor may we be able to implement guaranteed preventive measures against such security breaches cyber threats are rapidly evolving and we may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss cybersecurity risks for banking organizations have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies and the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions for example cybersecurity risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobilepayment and other internetbased product offerings and expand our internal usage of webbased products and applications in addition cybersecurity risks have significantly increased in recent years in part due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime affiliates terrorist organizations hostile foreign governments disgruntled employees or vendors activists and other external parties including those involved in corporate espionage even the most advanced internal control environment may be vulnerable to compromise targeted social engineering attacks and spear phishing attacks are becoming more sophisticated and are extremely difficult to prevent in such an attack an attacker will attempt to fraudulently induce colleagues customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to its data or that of its clients persistent attackers may succeed in penetrating defenses given enough resources time and motive the techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently and may not be recognized until launched or until well after a breach has occurred the risk of a security breach caused by a cyberattack at a vendor or by unauthorized vendor access has also increased in recent years additionally the existence of cyberattacks or security breaches at thirdparty vendors with access to our data may not be disclosed to us in a timely manner we also face indirect technology cybersecurity and operational risks relating to the customers clients and other third parties with whom we do business or upon whom we rely to facilitate or enable our business activities including for example financial counterparties regulators and providers of critical infrastructure such as internet access and electrical power as a result of increasing consolidation interdependence and complexity of financial entities and technology systems a technology failure cyberattack or other information or security breach that significantly degrades deletes or compromises the systems or data of one or more financial entities could have a material impact on counterparties or other market participants including us this consolidation interconnectivity and complexity increases the risk of operational failure on both individual and industrywide bases as disparate systems need to be integrated often on an accelerated basis any thirdparty technology failure cyberattack or other information or security breach termination or constraint could among other things adversely affect our ability to effect transactions service our clients manage our exposure to risk or expand our business cyberattacks or other information or security breaches whether directed at us or third parties may result in a material loss or have material consequences furthermore the public perception that a cyberattack on our systems has been successful whether or not this perception is correct may damage our reputation with customers and third parties with whom we do business hacking of personal information and identity theft risks in particular could cause serious reputational harm a successful table start table end penetration or circumvention of system security could cause us serious negative consequences including our loss of customers and business opportunities significant disruption to our operations and business misappropriation or destruction of our confidential information andor that of our customers or damage to our or our customers andor third parties computers or systems and could result in a violation of applicable privacy laws and other laws litigation exposure regulatory fines penalties or intervention remediation costs loss of confidence in our security measures reputational damage reimbursement or other compensatory costs remediation costs additional compliance costs and could adversely impact our results of operations liquidity and financial condition our vendors may be responsible for failures that adversely affect our operations we use and rely upon many external vendors to provide us with daytoday products and services essential to our operations we are thus exposed to risk that such vendors will not perform as contracted or at agreedupon
