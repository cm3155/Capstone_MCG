reserve system the occ and the fdic have adopted the regulatory capital standards in accordance with basel iii as developed by the basel committee on banking supervision basel iii capital rules the basel iii capital rules which were fully phasedin on january strengthened international capital standards by increasing institutions minimum capital requirements and holdings of high quality liquid assets and decreasing bank leverage under the basel iii capital rules websters assets exposures and certain offbalance sheet commitments and obligations are subject to risk weights used to determine riskweighted assets risk weights can range from for us government securities to for certain tranches of complex securitization or equity exposures riskweighted assets serve as the base against which regulatory capital is measured and are used to calculate websters and webster banks minimum capital ratios of cet1 capital to total riskweighted assets cet1 riskbased capital tier capital to total riskweighted assets tier riskbased capital total capital to total riskweighted assets total riskbased capital and tier capital to average tangible assets tier leverage capital as defined in the regulations which webster is required to maintain cet1 capital consists of common shareholders equity less deductions for goodwill and other intangible assets and certain deferred tax adjustments at the time of initial adoption of the basel iii capital rules webster had elected to optout of the requirement to include certain components of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci in cet1 capital tier capital consists of cet1 capital plus preferred stock total capital consists of tier capital and tier capital as defined in the regulations tier capital includes subordinated debt and the permissible portion of the acl the following table summarizes the ratio thresholds applicable to webster pursuant to the basel iii capital rules table start adequately capitalized well capitalized cet1 riskbased capital total riskbased capital tier riskbased capital tier leverage capital table end in addition the basel iii capital rules mandate that most deductions from or adjustments to regulatory capital be made to cet1 capital not to the other components for instance the deduction of mortgage servicing assets certain deferred tax assets dtas and capital investments in unconsolidated financial institutions is required to the extent that any one such category exceeds of cet1 capital or exceeds of cet1 capital in the aggregate the basel iii capital rules also include a capital conservation buffer comprised entirely of cet1 capital which is considered in addition to the cet1 capital ratio and is equal to of riskweighted assets for both webster and webster bank this buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress and is generally required in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers on july the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that simplified the regulatory capital treatment for mortgage servicing assets certain dtas arising from temporary differences investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions and the calculation of minority interest these provisions were effective as of april on august in response to the covid19 pandemic the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that provided banking organizations that implemented accounting standards update no financial instruments credit losses topic measurement of credit losses on financial instruments cecl during the option to delay an estimate of cecls effect on regulatory capital for two years ending on january followed by a threeyear transition period ending on december webster elected to utilize the capital transition relief and delayed the regulatory capital impact of adopting cecl both webster financial corporations and webster banks ratios remain in excess of being wellcapitalized even without the benefit of the delayed cecl adoption impact prompt corrective action pursuant to section of the fdia the federal banking agencies are required to take prompt corrective action if an insured depository institution fails to meet certain capital adequacy standards the following table summarizes the prompt corrective action categories table start well adequately under significantly capitalized capitalized capitalized under capitalized cet1 riskbased capital total riskbased capital tier riskbased capital tier leverage capital table end in addition an insured depository institution with a ratio of tangible equity less than or equal to is considered to be critically under capitalized if an insured depository institution has been determined after notice and opportunity for a heading to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives a lessthansatisfactory rating for asset quality management earnings or liquidity in its most recent examination the appropriate federal banking agency may downgrade a well capitalized adequately capitalized or under capitalized insured depository institution to the next lower capital category all insured depository institutions regardless of their capital category are prohibited from making capital distributions or paying management fees if such distributions or payments would result in the insured depository institution becoming under capitalized unless it is shown that the capital distribution would improve financial condition or the management fee is being paid to a person or entity without a controlling interest in the insured depository institution restrictions are placed on certain brokered deposit activity and on deposit rates offered as the capital category declines below well capitalized further if an insured depository institution receives notice that it is under capitalized significantly under capitalized or critically under capitalized the insured depository institution generally must file a written capital restoration plan with the appropriate federal banking agency within days of receipt and the bank holding company must guarantee the performance of that plan dividends the holding company is dependent upon dividends from webster bank to provide funds for its cash requirements including the payment of dividends to shareholders dividends paid by the bank are subject to various federal and state regulatory limitations express approval by the occ is required if the effect of dividends declared would cause the regulatory capital of the bank to fall below specified minimum levels or would exceed the net income for that year combined with the undistributed net income for the preceding two years during the year ended december webster bank paid million in dividends to the holding company and had million of undistributed net income available for the payment of dividends at december in addition federal banking regulators have the authority to prohibit webster from engaging in safe or unsound practices in conducting its business the payment of dividends depending on the financial condition of the bank could be deemed an unsafe or unsound practice especially if its capital base is depleted to an inadequate level the ability of webster bank to pay dividends in the future is currently and could be further influenced by bank regulatory policies and capital requirements enhanced prudential standards section of the doddfrank act requires the board of governors of the federal reserve system to establish enhanced prudential standards for larger bank holding companies on october pursuant to the enactment of the egrrcpa the federal reserve board along with other federal bank regulatory agencies adopted two rules outlining tailored prudential standards allowing bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of billion or less such as webster financial corporation to be exempt from certain enhanced capital and liquidity prudential standards imposed under section including companyrun stress testing capital planning liquidity coverage ratio and resolution planning requirements among others although webster financial corporation is no longer required to conduct companyrun stress testing for itself and webster bank the company continues to perform certain stress tests internally and incorporates the economic models and information developed through its stress testing program into its risk management and capital planning activities which continue to be subject to the regular supervisory processes of the federal reserve system and the occ in addition under a prior rule issued by the federal reserve board that implemented section of the doddfrank acts enhanced prudential standards certain publicly traded bank holding companies are required to establish a risk committee that is responsible for the oversight of enterprise risk management erm practices and that meets other statutory requirements the egrrcpa raised the threshold for mandatory application of the risk committee requirement from publicly traded bank holding companies with billion or more in total consolidated assets to billion or more notwithstanding this change implemented by egrrcpa webster has maintained its standing risk committee of the board of directors which is comprised of at least three independent directors volcker rule section of the doddfrank act commonly referred to as the volcker rule prohibits banking entities such as the holding company and webster bank from i engaging in shortterm proprietary trading of certain securities derivatives commodity futures and options on these investments for their own account and ii imposes limits on investments in and other relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds like the doddfrank act the volcker rule provides exemptions for certain activities including market making underwriting hedging trading in government obligations insurance company activities and organizing and offering hedge funds or private equity funds the volcker rule also clarifies that certain activities are not prohibited including acting as agent broker or custodian banking entities with significant trading operations those with billion or more in average trading assets and liabilities are required to establish a detailed compliance program to which their chief executive officers are required to attest that the program is reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the volcker rule the egrrcpa and subsequent promulgation of interagency rules have aimed to simplify and tailor the volcker rules requirements on june the federal reserve system commodity futures trading commission fdic occ and sec issued a final rule that modified the volcker rules prohibition on banking entities investing in or sponsoring hedge funds or private equity funds known as covered funds the final rule modifies three areas of the volcker rule by i streamlining the covered funds portion of the rule ii addressing the extraterritorial treatment of certain foreign funds and iii permitting banking entities to offer financial services and engage in other activities that do not raise concerns that the volcker rule was intended to address the new rule became effective october the federal reserve system had granted webster an extension until july to bring its holdings into compliance with the volcker rule webster dissolved its remaining holdings in illiquid covered funds during and is fully compliant with the volcker rule as of december federal reserve system federal reserve system regulations require depository institutions to maintain reserves against its transaction accounts and nonpersonal time deposits for the purposes of implementing monetary policy the reserve requirement must be satisfied in the form of vault cash and if vault cash is insufficient by maintaining a balance in an account at a federal reserve bank frb the federal reserve act fra authorizes different ranges of reserve requirement ratios depending on the amount of transaction account balances held at each depository institution pursuant to the fra a zero percent reserve requirement ratio shall be applied to total reservable liabilities that do not exceed a certain amount known as the reserve requirement exemption amount in addition transaction account balances maintained over the reserve requirement exemption amount and up to a certain amount known as the low reserve tranche may be subject to a reserve requirement ratio of not more than percent and which may be zero and transaction account balances over the low reserve tranche may be subject to a reserve requirement ratio of not more than percent and which may be zero the reserve requirement exemption and the low reserve tranche are both subject to adjustment on an annual basis as applicable by the board of governors of the federal reserve system effective march in response to the covid19 pandemic the reserve requirement ratios on all net transaction accounts were reduced to zero percent thereby eliminating reserve requirements for all depository institutions the annual indexation of the reserve requirement exemption amount and the low reserve tranche for was required by statute but did not affect depository institutions reserve requirements which has remained at zero further as a national bank and a member of the federal reserve system the bank is required to subscribe to the capital stock of its district frb in an amount equal to of its

the beginning of each year up to a maximum of million plus an amount that varies from to depending on the maturities of its fhlb advances of which there were million outstanding at december webster bank was in compliance with these requirements at december and held an fhlb of boston stock investment of million source of strength doctrine section of the doddfrank act and federal reserve system regulations require that bank holding companies serve as a source of financial strength to their subsidiary banks and commit resources to support each of their subsidiary banks this support may be required at times when the holding company is not in a financial position to provide such resources without adversely affecting its ability to meet other obligations the federal reserve system may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices if it fails to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank or if it undertakes actions that the federal reserve system believes might jeopardize the bank holding companys ability to commit resources to such subsidiary bank capital loans by banking holding companies to its subsidiary banks would be subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other debts of the subsidiary bank in the event of bankruptcy any commitment by a bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment in addition under the national bank act if webster banks capital stock is impaired by losses or otherwise the occ is authorized to require payment of the deficiency by assessment upon the holding company if the assessment is not paid within three months after receiving notice thereof the occ could order a sale of webster bank stock held to cover any deficiency safety and soundness standards

applicable to all insured depository institutions these guidelines prescribe standards relating to internal controls information systems internal audit systems loan documentation credit underwriting interest rate exposure asset growth compensation fees and benefits asset quality earnings and stock valuation as determined to be appropriate if a federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any of the established standards the agency may require the institution to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard in the event that an institution fails to submit an acceptable plan within the time allowed or fails in any material respect to implement an accepted plan the agency must require the institution to correct the deficiency and may take other supervisory and enforcement actions until the deficiency is corrected in more serious instances enforcement actions may include i the issuance of directives to increase capital the issuance of formal and informal agreements ii the imposition of civil monetary penalties iii the issuance of a cease and desist order that can be judicially enforced iv the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against officers directors and other institution affiliated parties v the termination of the insured depository institutions deposit insurance vi the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the

subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate and with all affiliates in the aggregate and ii requiring that all such transactions be on terms substantially the same or at least favorable to the institution or subsidiary as those provided to a nonaffiliate the term covered transaction includes the making of loans purchase of assets the issuance of a guarantee and similar types of transactions certain covered transactions must be collateralized according to a schedule set forth in the statue in addition section 22h of the fra and federal reserve regulation o restricts loans to directors executive officers and principal stockholders or insiders pursuant to section 22h loans to directors executive officers and principal stockholders must be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons except that such insiders may receive preferential loans made under a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to the institutions employees and does not give preference to the insider over the employees further loans to insiders and their related interests may not exceed together with all other outstanding loans to such persons and affiliated entities the institutions total capital and surplus loans to insiders above specified amounts must receive prior approval from the companys board of directors section 22g of the fra places additional limitations on loans to executive officers consumer protection and consumer financial protection bureau supervision the doddfrank act centralized the

designed to protect borrowers and promote lending including but not limited to the equal credit opportunity act the fair credit reporting act the fair debt collection procedures act the truth in lending act the home mortgage disclosure act the real estate settlement practices act and the consumer financial protection act of which is part of the doddfrank act the doddfrank act permits states to adopt more stringent consumer protection laws and allows state attorneys general to enforce the consumer protection rules issued by the cfpb in addition the truth in lending act requires creditors to make a reasonable good faith determination of a consumers ability to repay their mortgage loans prior to extending them credit in making abilitytorepay determinations creditors must consider numerous underwriting factors as prescribed therein and use reliable thirdparty records to verify the information they use to evaluate such factors alternatively the creditor can originate qualified mortgages qms which are entitled to a presumption that the creditor making the loan satisfied the abilitytorepay requirements a qm is generally defined as a loan without negative amortization interestonly payments balloon payments or terms exceeding years the consumer is also required to have a total debttoincome ratio that is less than or equal to further the truth in lending act provides a safe harbor for loans that satisfy the definition of a qualified mortgage and are not higherpriced and a rebuttable presumption for higherpriced mortgage loans on december the cfpb issued two final rules amending the abilitytorepay and qm rules of the truth in lending act the first replaces the existing debttoincome ratio limit in the general qm definition with pricebased thresholds among other changes and the second creates a new category of qms called the seasoned qm a loan is eligible to become a seasoned qm if the loan meets certain product restrictions at the end of the 36month seasoning period including i is secured by a first lien ii has a fixed rate iii has regular substantially equal periodic payments that are fully amortizing does not allow negative amortization and does not have a balloon payment iv the term does not exceed years and v is not a higherpriced mortgage the first rule has a mandatory compliance date of october the second rule applies to covered transactions for which institutions received an application after march however due to the 36month seasoning period there was no immediate impact to webster in addition on december the cfpb issued a final rule amending regulation z which implements the truth in lending act to address the anticipated sunset of libor for consumer financial products which is expected to be discontinued for most us dollar usd tenors in june specifically the cfpb is amending i the openend and closedend provisions to provide examples of replacement indices for libor indices that meet certain regulation z standards ii to permit creditors for home equity lines of credit and card issuers for credit card accounts to transition existing accounts that use a libor index to a replacement index on or after april if certain conditions are met iii to address changeinterms notice for home equity lines of credit and credit card accounts and how they apply to accounts transitioning away from using a libor index and iv to address how the rate reevaluation provisions applicable to credit card accounts apply to the transition from using a libor index to a replacement index for closedend credit the final rule identified certain sofrbased spreadadjusted indices recommended by the alternative reference rates committee arrc for consumer products as examples to illustrate a reference rate that would be comparable to replace 1month 3month or 6month tenors of usd libor for openend credit the final rule states that the chosen replacement index must have historical fluctuations that are substantially similar to those of the libor index and identifies certain sofrbased spreadadjusted indices recommended by the arrc for consumer products and the prime rate as examples that meet this standard however the cfpb is reserving judgment about whether to include references to a 1year usd libor index and its replacement index until it obtains additional information the final rule becomes effective april
