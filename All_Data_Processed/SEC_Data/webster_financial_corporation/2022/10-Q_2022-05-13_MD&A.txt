analysts investors and other interested parties to assess peer company operating performance management believes this presentation together with the accompanying reconciliations provides a complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting websters business and allows investors to view its performance in a similar manner tangible book value per common share represents shareholders equity

creditdeteriorated pcd loans and leases that were acquired from sterling during the three months ended march and total net chargeoffs were million and million respectively the million increase is primarily attributed to an increased volume of net chargeoffs in the commercial nonmortgage portfolio partially offset by a decreased volume of net chargeoffs in the commercial real estate and other

million and million for the three months ended march and respectively reflecting an effective tax benefit rate of for the three months ended march and an effective tax expense rate of for the three months ended march the income tax benefit and related effective tax benefit rate for the three months ended march reflects the effects of the pretax loss as well as taxexempt income and tax credits recognized during the period and a million deferred state and local tax salt benefit associated with the merger with sterling of which million related to a change in managements estimate about the realizability of its salt deferred tax assets dtas due to an estimated increase in future taxable income these effects were partially offset by the effect of million of mergerrelated expenses recognized during the period that were estimated to be nondeductible for income tax purposes at march and december webster recorded a valuation allowance on its dtas of million and million respectively the million at march reflects a reduction of million for the change in estimate discussed above and includes a million valuation allowance related to the bend acquisition at march and december websters gross dtas included million and million respectively applicable to salt net operating loss carryforwards that are available to offset future taxable income the million at march includes million related to the sterling merger and million related to the bend acquisition websters total gross dtas at march also included million and million respectively of federal net operating loss and credit carryforwards related to the sterling merger and bend acquisition which are subject to annual limitations on utilization the ultimate realization of dtas is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the net operating loss and credit carryforwards are available in making its assessment management considers the companys forecasted future results of operations estimates the content and apportionment of its income by legal entity over the near term for salt purposes and also applies longerterm growth rate assumptions based on its estimates management believes it is more likely than not that the company will realize its dtas net of the valuation allowance at march however it is possible that some or all of websters net operating loss and credit carryforwards could expire unused or that more net operating loss and credit carryforwards could be utilized than estimated either as a result of changes in future forecasted levels of taxable income or if future economic or market conditions or interest rates were to vary significantly from the companys forecasts and in turn impact its future results of operations additional information regarding websters income taxes including its dtas can be found within note income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item financial statements and supplementary data of the companys annual report on form 10k for the year ended december segment reporting websters operations are organized into three reportable segments that represent its primary

the underlying collateral provided by the borrower warehouse lending loans are primarily made based on the borrowers ability to originate highquality firstmortgage residential loans that can be sold into the agency government or private jumbo markets and secondarily on the underlying cash flows of the borrower however the cash flows of borrowers may not be as expected and the collateral securing these loans as applicable may fluctuate in value most commercial nonmortgage assetbased and equipment finance loans are secured by the assets being financed and may incorporate personal guarantees of the principal balance warehouse lending loans are generally uncommitted facilities commercial real estate loans including multifamily are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to those for commercial nonmortgage assetbased equipment finance and warehouse lending loans these loans are primarily viewed as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate repayment of commercial real estate loans is largely dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loan the market in which the property is located and the tenants of the property securing the loan the properties securing the companys commercial real estate portfolio are diverse in terms of type and geographic location which reduces the companys exposure to adverse economic events that may affect a particular market management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on collateral geography and risk grade criteria all transactions are appraised to validate market value commercial real estate loans may be adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy management periodically utilizes thirdparty experts to provide insight and guidance about economic conditions and trends affecting its commercial real estate loan portfolio consumer loans are subject to policies and procedures developed to manage the specific risk characteristics of the portfolio these policies and procedures coupled with relatively small individual loan amounts and predominately collateralized loan structures are spread across many different borrowers minimizing the level of credit risk trend and outlook reports are reviewed by management on a regular basis and policies and procedures are modified or developed as needed underwriting

bank originates both qualified mortgage and nonqualified mortgage loans as defined by applicable consumer financial protection bureau cfpb rules allowance for credit losses on loans and leases the acl on loans and leases increased million or from million at december to million at march primarily due to the initial acl of million and million recorded for pcd and nonpcd loans and leases respectively that were acquired from sterling the establishment of the initial acl for pcd loans and leases is net of million in chargeoffs which were recognized upon completion of the merger in accordance with gaap the following table summarizes the percentage allocation of the acl across the loans and leases categories at march at december  in thousands amount amount commercial nonmortgage assetbased commercial real estate multifamily equipment financing warehouse lending residential home equity other consumer total acl on loans and leases the acl allocated to a single loan and lease category does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other categories methodology websters acl on loans and leases is considered to be a critical accounting policy the acl on loans and leases is a contraasset account that offsets the amortized cost basis of loans and leases for the credit losses that are expected to occur over the life of the asset executive management reviews and advises on the adequacy of the allowance which is maintained at a level that management deems to be sufficient to cover expected losses within the loan and lease portfolios the acl on loans and leases is determined using the cecl model whereby an expected lifetime credit loss is recognized at the origination or purchase of an asset including those acquired through a business combination which is then reassessed at each reporting date over the contractual life of the asset the calculation of expected credit losses includes consideration of past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts generally expected credit losses are determined through a pooled collective assessment of loans and leases with similar risk characteristics however if the risk characteristics of a loan or lease change such that it no longer matches that of the collectively assessed pool it is removed from the population and individually assessed for credit losses the total acl on loans and leases recorded by management represents the aggregated estimated credit loss determined through both the collective and individual assessments collectively assessed loans and leases collectively assessed loans and leases are segmented based on product type credit quality risk ratings andor collateral types within its commercial and consumer portfolios and expected losses are determined using a probability of default pd loss given default lgd and exposure at default ead loss rate or discounted cash flow framework for portfolios using the pdlgdead framework credit losses are calculated as the product of the probability of a loan defaulting expected loss given the occurrence of a default and the expected exposure of a loan at default summing the product across loans over their lives yields the lifetime expected credit losses for a given portfolio managements pd and lgd calculations are predictive models that measure the current risk profile of the loan pools using forecasts of future macroeconomic conditions historical loss information loanlevel risk attributes and credit risk ratings the calculation of ead follows an iterative process to determine the expected remaining principal balance of a loan based on historical paydown rates for loans of a similar segment within the same portfolio the calculation of portfolio exposure in future quarters incorporates expected losses the loans amortization schedule and prepayment rates under the loss rate method expected credit losses are estimated using a loss rate that is multiplied by the amortized cost of the asset at the balance sheet date for each loan segment identified above we apply an expected historical loss trend based on thirdparty loss estimates correlate them to observed economic metrics and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions under the discounted cash flow method expected credit losses are determined by comparing the amortized cost of the asset at the balance sheet date to the present value of estimated future principal and interest payments expected to be collected over the remaining life of the asset our loss model generates cash flow projections at the loan level based on reasonable and supportable projections from which we estimate payment collections adjusted for curtailments recovery time probability of default and loss given default websters models incorporate an economic forecast scenario and macroeconomic assumptions over a reasonable and supportable forecast period the development of the reasonable and supportable forecast assumes each macroeconomic variable will revert to longterm expectations with reversion characteristics unique to specific economic indicators and forecasts reversion towards longterm expectations generally begins two to three years from the forecast start date and is complete within three to five years certain models revert to mean historical portfolio loss rates on a straightline basis in the third year of the forecast and are therefore considered to be explicitly mean reverting at output level in other models the reasonable and supportable economic variable forecasts are mean reverting and therefore the modeled results are considered to be implicitly mean reverting at input level webster incorporates forecasts of macroeconomic variables in the determination of expected credit losses macroeconomic variables are selected for each class of financing receivable based on relevant factors such as asset type the correlation of the variables to credit losses among others data from the forecast scenario of these variables is used as an input to the modeled loss calculation a portion of the collective acl is comprised of qualitative adjustments for risk characteristics that are not reflected or captured in the quantitative models but are likely to impact the measurement of estimated credit losses qualitative factors are based on our judgement of the company market industry or business specific data including loan trends portfolio segment composition and loan rating or credit scores qualitative adjustments may be applied in relation to economic forecasts when relevant facts and circumstances are expected to impact credit losses particularly in times of significant volatility in economic activity individually assessed loans and leases if the risk characteristics of a loan or lease change such that it no longer matches the risk characteristics of the collectively assessed pool it is removed from the population and individually assessed for credit losses generally all nonaccrual loans tdrs potential tdrs loans with a chargeoff and collateral dependent loans where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty are individually assessed the measurement method used to calculate the expected credit loss on an individually assessed loan or lease is dependent on the type and whether the loan or lease is considered to be collateral dependent methods for collateral dependent loans are either based on the fair value of the collateral less estimated cost to sell when the basis of repayment is the sale of collateral or the present value of the expected cash flows from the operation of the collateral for noncollateral dependent loans either a discounted cash flow method or other loss factor method is used any individually assessed loan or lease for which no specific valuation allowance is deemed necessary is either the result of sufficient cash flows or sufficient collateral coverage relative to the amortized cost of the asset additional information regarding websters acl methodology can be found within note summary of significant accounting policies in the

results of operations respectively assetliability management and market risk an effective assetliability management process must balance the risks and rewards from both shortterm and longterm interest rate risks when determining managements strategy and action to facilitate this interest rate sensitivity is monitored on an ongoing basis by the assetliability committee alco the primary goal of alco is to manage interest rate risk and to maximize net income and net economic value over time in changing interest rate environments alco meets at least monthly to make decisions on the investment securities and funding portfolios based on the economic outlook its interest rate expectations the portfolio risk position and other factors four main tools are used for managing interest rate risk the size duration and credit risk of the investment portfolio the size and duration of the wholesale funding portfolio interest rate contracts and the pricing and structure of loans and deposits management measures interest rate risk using simulation analysis to calculate websters earnings at risk and equity at risk essentially interest rates are assumed to change up or down in a parallel fashion and the net interest income results in each scenario are compared to a flat rate based scenario the flat rate scenario holds the end of period yield curve constant over a twelve month forecasted horizon at march and december the flat rate scenario assumed a federal funds rate of and respectively the federal funds rate target range was at march and at december due to the lower rate environment management did not run standard scenarios with negative interest rate assumptions to model the down rate scenarios that were previously modeled when market rates were higher the following table summarizes the estimated impact that gradual parallel changes in interest rates of and basis points might have on websters net interest income over a twelve month period starting at march and december as compared to actual net interest income and assuming no changes in interest rates 200bp 100bp 100bp 200bp march na na december na na asset sensitivity in terms of net interest income increased at march as compared to december primarily due to changes in the overall composition and size of the balance sheet on a combined basis postmerger and the relative size and duration of the securities portfolio loans at floors have increased billion from billion at december to billion at march while loans with floors which are considered in the money have the impact of reducing overall asset sensitivity as interest rates start to rise these loans will move through their floors and begin to reprice accordingly the following table summarizes the estimated impact that yield curve twists or immediate nonparallel changes in interest rates might have on websters net interest income for the subsequent twelve month period starting at march and december short end of the yield curve long end of the yield curve 100bp 50bp 50bp 100bp 100bp 50bp 50bp 100bp march na na december na na these nonparallel scenarios are modeled with the short end of the yield curve moving up or down and basis points while the long end of the yield curve remains unchanged and vice versa the short end of the yield curve is defined as terms less than eighteen months and the long end of the yield curve is defined as terms greater than eighteen months the results reflect the annualized impact of immediate interest rate changes sensitivity to the short end and long end of the yield curve for net interest income decreased at march as compared to december primarily due to changes in the overall composition and size of the balance sheet on a combined basis postmerger as well as the relative size and duration of the securities portfolio and slower forecasted prepayment speeds as a result of increases in the long end of the yield curve which in turn extends the duration for mortgagebacked securities and residential mortgage loans the following table summarizes the estimated economic value of financial assets financial liabilities and offbalance sheet financial instruments and the corresponding estimated change in economic value if interest rates were to instantaneously increase or decrease by basis points at march and december  in thousands book value estimated economic value estimated economic value change bp bp march assets na liabilities na net na net change as base net economic value na december assets na liabilities na net na net change as base net economic value na changes in economic value can best be described through duration which is a measure of the price sensitivity of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates for fixedrate financial instruments it can be thought of as the weightedaverage expected time to receive future cash flows whereas for floatingrate financial instruments it can be thought of as the weightedaverage expected time until the next rate reset overall the longer the duration the greater the price sensitivity due to changes in interest rates generally increases in interest rates reduce the economic value of fixedrate financial assets as future discounted cash flows are worth less at higher interest rates in a rising interest rate environment the economic value of financial liabilities decreases for the same reason a reduction in the economic value of financial liabilities is a benefit to webster floatingrate financial instruments may have durations as short as one day and therefore may have very little price sensitivity due to changes in interest rates duration gap represents the difference between the duration of financial assets and financial liabilities a duration gap at or near zero would imply that the balance sheet is matched and therefore would exhibit no change in estimated economic value for changes in interest rates at march and december websters duration gap was negative years and negative years respectively a negative duration gap implies that the duration of financial liabilities is longer than the duration of financial assets and therefore liabilities have more price sensitivity than assets and will reset their interest rates at a slower pace consequently websters net estimated economic value would generally be expected to increase when interest rates rise as the benefit of the decreased value of financial liabilities would more than offset the decreased value of financial assets the opposite would generally be expected to occur when interest rates fall earnings would also generally be expected to increase when interest rates rise and decrease when interest rates fall over the long term absent the effects of any new business booked in the future at march longterm rates have risen by basis points as compared to december this higher starting point extends financial asset duration by decreasing residential mortgage loans and mortgagebacked securities prepayment speeds these earnings and economic values estimates are subject to factors that could cause actual results to differ and also assume that management does not take any additional action to mitigate any positive or negative effects from changing interest rates management believes that the companys interest rate risk position at march represents a reasonable level of risk given the current interest rate outlook management is prepared to take additional action in the event that interest rates do change rapidly additional information regarding websters assetliability

operations of the companys annual report on form 10k for the year ended december critical accounting estimates the preparation of websters condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying

consolidated financial statements contained in item financial statements and in note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included in the companys annual report on form 10k for the year ended december critical accounting policies are defined as those that are most important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results of operations and that require management to make difficult subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and which could potentially result in materially different amounts using different assumptions or under different conditions accounting estimates are necessary in the application of certain accounting policies and can be susceptible to significant change in the near term critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with gaap that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on websters financial condition or results of operations websters most critical accounting policies and accounting estimates are those related to the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases and business combinations these critical accounting policies including its underlying estimates are discussed directly with the audit committee of the board of directors allowance for credit losses on loans and leases the acl on loans and leases is a reserve established through a provision for credit losses charged to expense which represents managements best estimate of expected lifetime credit losses within websters loan and lease portfolios at the balance sheet date the calculation of expected credit losses is determined using predictive methods and models that follow a pdlgdead loss rate or discounted cash flow framework and include consideration of past events current conditions macroeconomic variables such as unemployment gross domestic product property values and interest rate spreads and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts changes to the acl on loans and leases and therefore to the related provision for credit losses can materially affect financial results the determination of the appropriate level of acl on loans and leases inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires webster to make significant estimates of current credit risks and trends using existing qualitative and quantitative information and reasonable supportable forecasts of future economic conditions all of which may undergo frequent and material changes changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers and macroeconomic variables that webster is more susceptible to unforeseen events such as natural disasters and pandemics along with new information regarding existing loans identification of additional problems loans the fair value of underlying collateral and other factors both within and outside the companys control may indicate the need for an increase or decrease in the acl on loans and leases it is difficult to estimate the sensitivity of how potential changes in any one economic factor or input might affect the overall reserve because a wide variety of factors and inputs are considered in estimating the acl and changes in those factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all product types further changes in factors and inputs may also be directionally inconsistent such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in others executive management reviews and advises on the adequacy of the acl on loans and leases on a quarterly basis although the overall balance is determined based on specific portfolio segments and individually assessed assets the entire balance is available to absorb credit losses for any of the loan and lease portfolios business combinations the acquisition method of accounting generally requires that the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date the determination of fair value often involves the use of internal or thirdparty valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow analyses or appraisals particularly the valuation techniques used to estimate the fair value of loans and leases and the core deposit intangible asset acquired in the sterling merger include estimates related to discount rates credit risk and other relevant factors which are inherently subjective a description of the

consolidated financial statements of webster have been prepared in accordance with gaap for interim financial information and article of regulation sx certain information and footnote disclosures required by gaap for complete financial statements have been omitted or condensed therefore the condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with websters annual report on form 10k for the year ended december the results of operations for the three months ended march are not necessarily indicative of the future results that may be attained for the entire year or other interim periods in the opinion of management all necessary adjustments have been reflected to present fairly the financial position results of operations and cash flows for the reporting periods presented intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation assets under administration or assets under management that webster holds or manages in a fiduciary or agency capacity for customers are not included in the consolidated financial statements reclassifications certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation these reclassifications did not have a significant impact on the companys consolidated financial statements use of estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates business combinations business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method in which the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are generally measured and recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date with the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired capitalized as goodwill items such as acquired rightofuse rou lease assets and operating lease liabilities as lessee employee benefit plans and incometax related balances are recognized in accordance with other applicable gaap which may result in measurements that differ from fair value business combinations are included in the consolidated financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition historical reporting periods reflect only the results of legacy webster operations mergerrelated costs are expensed in their applicable noninterest expense categories in the period incurred additional information regarding websters mergers and acquisitions can be found within note mergers and acquisitions purchased creditdeteriorated loans and leases purchased creditdeteriorated pcd loans and leases are defined as those that have experienced a morethaninsignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination webster considers a variety of factors to evaluate and identify whether acquired loans are pcd including but not limited to nonaccrual status delinquency tdr classification partial chargeoffs decreases in fico scores risk rating downgrades and other factors upon acquisition expected credit losses are added to the fair value of individual pcd loans and leases to determine the amortized cost basis after initial recognition any changes to the estimate of expected credit losses favorable or unfavorable are recorded as a provision for credit loss during the period of change pcd accounting is also applied to loans and leases previously chargedoff by the acquiree if webster has contractual rights to the cash flows at the acquisition date webster recognizes an additional allowance for credit loss for these amounts previously chargedoff by the acquiree with a corresponding increase to the amortized costs basis balances deemed to be uncollectible are immediately chargedoff in accordance with websters chargeoff policies resulting in the establishment of the initial allowance for credit losses for pcd loans and leases to be recorded net of these uncollectible balances relevant accounting standards issued but not yet adopted in march the fasb issued asu no 202202financial instrumentscredit losses topic troubled debt restructurings and vintage disclosures which eliminates the accounting guidance for tdrs by creditors in subtopic receivablestroubled debt restructurings by creditors while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty specifically rather than applying the recognition and measurement guidance for tdrs an entity must apply the loan refinancing and restructuring guidance in paragraphs through to determine whether a modification results in a new loan or a continuation of an existing loan in addition asu no requires that an entity disclose currentperiod gross writeoffs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases within the scope of subtopic financial instrumentscredit lossesmeasured at amortized cost in the vintage disclosures required by paragraph asu no is effective for fiscal years beginning after december with early adoption permitted the amendments should be applied prospectively however an entity has the option to apply a modified retrospective transition method related to the recognition and measurement of tdrs which would result in a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings in the period of adoption the company is in the early assessment stage of evaluating the amendments as well as determining under which transition method it plans to adopt for tdrs therefore the company is currently unable to reasonably estimate the impact of adoption on the consolidated financial statements note mergers and acquisitions merger with sterling bancorp on january webster completed its previously announced merger with sterling pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated as of april the merger agreement in which sterling merged with and into webster with webster continuing as the surviving corporation following the merger on february sterling national bank a whollyowned subsidiary of sterling merged with and into webster bank with webster bank continuing as the surviving bank sterling was a fullservice regional bank headquartered in pearl river new york that primarily served the greater new york metropolitan area the merger expanded websters geographic footprint and combined two complementary organizations to create one of the largest commercial banks in the northeast us each share of sterling common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the merger other than certain shares held by webster and sterling was converted into the right to receive a fixed share of webster common stock in connection with the completion of the merger and in accordance with the merger agreement the number of authorized shares of webster common stock was increased from million shares to million shares as of january cash was also paid to sterling common shareholders in lieu of fractional shares as applicable in addition each share of sterling series a noncumulative perpetual preferred stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the merger was converted into the right to receive one share of newly created webster series g noncumulative perpetual preferred stock having substantially the same terms on january webster registered and issued depositary shares each representing 140th interest in a share of series g noncumulative preferred perpetual stock par value per share with a liquidation preference equal to per share equivalent to per depositary share the series g preferred stock the series g preferred stock ranks on parity with webster series f noncumulative preferred perpetual stock par value per share with a liquidation preference of per share equivalent to per depositary share and senior to webster common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and distributions upon the liquidation dissolution or windingup of webster series g preferred stock dividends are payable quarterly on the fifteenth day of each january april july and december if and when declared by the board of directors webster may redeem the series g preferred stock at its option in whole or in part subject to the approval of federal reserve board on october or any dividend payment date occurring thereafter or in whole but not in part upon the occurrence of a regulatory capital treatment event at a redemption price equal to the liquidation preference plus any declared and unpaid dividends without accumulation of any undeclared dividends further certain equity awards granted under sterlings equity compensation plans were converted into a corresponding award with respect to webster common stock generally subject to the same terms and conditions with the number of shares underlying such awards adjusted based on the fixed exchange ratio the following table summarizes the determination of the purchase price consideration in thousands except share and price per share data webster common stock issued price per share of webster common stock on january consideration for outstanding common stock consideration for preferred stock exchanged consideration for replacement equity awards cash in lieu of fractional shares total purchase price consideration the fair value of the replacement equity awards issued by webster and included in the consideration transferred pertain to services performed prior to the merger effective date the fair value attributed to services performed after the merger effective date will be recognized over the required service vesting period for each award and recorded as compensation and benefits expense on the consolidated statements of income webster recognized an incremental million of stock compensation expense related to the replacement equity awards during the three months ended march the merger was accounted for as a business combination accordingly the purchase price has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of the merger effective date the determination of fair value requires management to make estimates about discount rates future expected cash flows market conditions and other future events that are highly subjective in nature and are subject to change fair value estimates of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed may be adjusted for a period up to one year the measurement period from the closing date of the merger if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the merger effective date that if known would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date webster considers its valuations of loans and leases tax receivables and payables and certain other assets and other liabilities to be preliminary as management continues to identify and assess information regarding the nature of these assets acquired and liabilities assumed including extended information gathering management review procedures and any new information that may arise as a result of integration activities accordingly the amounts recorded for current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are also considered preliminary as webster continues to evaluate the nature and extent of permanent and temporary differences between the book and tax bases of the acquired assets and liabilities assumed while the company believes that the information available as of january provides a reasonable basis for estimating fair value it is possible that additional information may become available during the measurement period that would result in changes to the fair values presented any adjustments identified during the measurement period would be recognized in the corresponding reporting period the following table summarizes the preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of the

operating lease liabilities reported within premises and equipment and accrued expenses and other liabilities respectively which were measured based upon the estimated present value of the remaining lease payments in addition rou lease assets were adjusted for favorable and unfavorable terms of the lease when compared to market terms as applicable in connection with the merger webster recorded billion of goodwill which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired information regarding the allocation of goodwill to the companys reportable segments as well as the carrying amounts and amortization of the core deposit intangible and customer relationship intangible assets can be found within note segment reporting and note goodwill and other intangible assets respectively the following is a description of the valuation methodologies used to estimate the fair values of the significant assets acquired and liabilities assumed cash and due from banks and interestbearing deposits the carrying amount of these assets is a reasonable estimate of fair value based on the shortterm nature of these assets investment securities availableforsale the fair values for investment securities availableforsale were based on quoted market prices where available if quoted market prices were not available fair value estimates are based on observable inputs including quoted market prices for similar instruments investment securities heldtomaturity were reclassified to investment securities availableforsale based on the companys intent at closing loans and leases the fair values for loans and leases were estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology that considered factors including the type of loan or lease and the related collateral classification status fixed or variable interest rate remaining term amortization status and current discount rates in addition the probability of default loss given default and prepayment assumptions that were derived based on loan and lease characteristics historical loss experience comparable market data and current and forecasted economic conditions were used to estimate expected credit losses loans and leases generally were valued individually the discount rates used for loans and leases were based on current market rates for new originations or comparable loans and leases and include adjustments for liquidity the discount rate did not include credit losses as that was included as a reduction to the estimated cash flows premises and equipment the fair values for land and buildings were based on appraised values using the cost approach which estimates the price a buyer would pay if they were to rebuild or reconstruct a similar property on a comparable piece of land intangible assets a core deposit intangible asset represents the value of relationships with deposit clients the fair value of the core deposit intangible asset was estimated using a net cost savings method a form of discounted cash flow methodology that gave appropriate consideration to expected client attrition rates and other applicable adjustments to the projected deposit balance the interest cost and net maintenance cost associated with the client deposit base alternative cost of funds and a discount rate used to discount the future economic benefits of the core deposit intangible asset to present value the core deposit intangible asset is being amortized on an accelerated basis over years based upon the period over which the estimated economic benefits are estimated to be received customer relationship intangible assets for payroll finance factoring receivables finance and wealth businesses were estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology that reflects the estimated value of the future net earnings for each relationship with adjustments for attrition the customer relationship intangible assets are being amortized on an accelerated basis over their estimated useful life of years bankowned life insurance policies the cash surrender value of these insurance policies is a reasonable estimate of fair value since it reflects the amount that would be realized by the contract owner upon discontinuance or surrender deposits the fair values used for the demand and savings deposits by definition equal the amount payable on demand at the merger date the fair values for time deposits were estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology that applies interest rates currently being offered to the contractual interest rates on such time deposits securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings the carrying amount of these liabilities is a reasonable estimate of fair value based on the shortterm nature of these liabilities longterm debt the fair values of longterm debt instruments are estimated based on quoted market prices for the instrument if available or for similar instruments if not available or by using a discounted cash flow methodology based on current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of instruments pcd loans and leases purchased loans and leases that have experienced morethaninsignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination are considered pcd for pcd loans and leases the initial estimate of expected credit losses was established through an adjustment to the unpaid principal balance and noncredit discount at acquisition subsequent to the merger effective date webster recorded an acl for nonpcd loans and leases of million through an increase to the provision for credit losses there was no carryover of sterlings previously recorded acl on loans and leases the following table reconciles the unpaid principal balance to the fair value of pcd loans

liabilities of sterling subsequent to the merger on january due to the various conversions of sterling systems during the first quarter of as well as other streamlining and integration of operating activities into those of the company historical reporting for the former sterling operations after january is impracticable and thus disclosures of sterlings revenue and earnings since the merger effective date that are included in the condensed consolidated statements of income for the reporting period is impracticable bend financial inc acquisition on february webster acquired of the equity interests of bend a cloudbased platform solution provider for hsas in exchange for cash of million the acquisition accelerates websters efforts underway to deliver enhanced user experiences at hsa bank the transaction was accounted for as a business combination and resulted in the addition of million in net assets which primarily comprises million of internal use software and a million customer relationship intangible asset note strategic initiatives during the fourth quarter of webster launched a strategic plan the strategic initiatives to drive incremental revenue and cost savings measures across the organization through the consolidation of banking centers and corporate facilities process automation ancillary spend reduction and other organizational actions by the end of key project milestones had been completed including the completion of all planned banking center closures the delivery of a new digital onboarding platform for retail consumers an investment in foundational technology modernization and the realignment of certain business banking and investment service operations across the companys reportable segments collectively these initiatives have contributed to the realization of operational efficiencies and ancillary spend reductions in connection with the sterling merger webster reevaluated its strategic priorities as a combined organization which resulted in modifications to the outstanding strategic initiatives as a result the company released million from its previously recorded severance accrual during the first quarter of with a corresponding adjustment to compensation and benefits expense on the condensed consolidated statements of income at march and december respectively million and million of accrued severance and other benefits

profile has ten grades with each grade corresponding to a progressively greater risk of loss grades to are considered pass ratings and grades to are considered criticized as defined by the regulatory agencies a special mention rating has a potential weakness that if left uncorrected may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset a substandard rating has a welldefined weakness that jeopardizes the full repayment of the debt a doubtful rating has all of the same weaknesses as a substandard asset with the added characteristic that the weakness makes collection or liquidation

into fixedrate debt while certain receive fixedpay variable interest rate swaps are designated as fair value hedges to effectively convert fixedrate longterm debt into variablerate debt certain purchased options are designated as cash flow hedges purchased options allow the company to limit the potential adverse impact of variable interest rates by establishing a cap or floor rate in exchange for an upfront premium the purchased options designated as cash flow hedges represent interest rate caps where payment is received from the counterparty if interest rates rise above the cap rate and interest rate floors where payment is received from the counterparty when interest rates fall below the floor rate derivatives not designated in hedge relationships the company also enters

adjustment over time including changes in the credit spreads of the parties to the contracts as well as changes in market rates and volatilities which affect the total expected exposure of the derivative instruments note fair value measurements fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the determination of fair value may require the use of estimates when quoted market prices are not available fair value estimates made at a specific point in time are based on managements judgments regarding future expected losses current economic conditions the risk characteristics of each financial instrument and other subjective factors that cannot be determined with precision the framework for measuring fair value provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure value the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs the three levels within the fair value hierarchy are as follows level inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that webster has the ability to access at the measurement date level inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as interest rates rate volatility prepayment speeds and credit ratings or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by market data correlation or other means level inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement this includes certain pricing models or other similar techniques that require significant management judgment or estimation assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis availableforsale investment securities when unadjusted quoted prices are available in an active market webster classifies availableforsale investment securities within level of the fair value hierarchy us treasury notes have a readily determinable fair value and therefore are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy when quoted market prices are not available webster employs an independent pricing service that utilizes

corporate debt and other securities availableforsale are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy derivative instruments the fair values presented for derivative instruments include any accrued interest foreign exchange contracts are valued based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and accordingly are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy except for mortgage banking derivatives all other derivative instruments are valued using thirdparty valuation software which considers the present value of cash flows discounted using observable forward rate assumptions the resulting fair value is then validated against valuations performed by independent third parties these derivative instruments are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy mortgage banking derivatives webster uses forward sales of mortgage loans and mortgagebacked securities to manage the risk of loss associated with its mortgage loan commitments and mortgage loans held for sale prior to closing and funding certain singlefamily residential mortgage loans an interest rate lock commitment is generally extended to the borrower during this inbetween time period webster is subject to the risk that market interest rates may change if rates rise investors generally will pay less to purchase mortgage loans which would result in a reduction in the gain on sale of the loans or possibly a loss in an effort to mitigate this risk forward delivery sales commitments are established in which webster agrees to either deliver whole mortgage loans to various investors or issue mortgagebacked securities the fair value of mortgage banking derivatives is determined based on current market prices for similar assets in the secondary market accordingly mortgage banking derivatives are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy originated loans held for sale webster has elected to measure originated loans held for sale at fair value under the fair value option per asc topic financial instruments electing to measure originated loans held for sale at fair value reduces certain timing differences and better reflects the price webster would expect to

pricing and allocations for noninterest expense provision for credit losses income taxes and equity capital these estimates and allocations certain of which are subjective in nature are periodically reviewed and refined changes in estimates and allocations that affect the results of any one reportable segment do not affect the consolidated financial position or results of operations of webster as a whole the full profitability measurement reports which are prepared for each reportable segment reflect nongaap reporting methodologies the differences between full profitability and gaap results are reconciled in the corporate and reconciling category webster allocates interest income and interest expense to each business through an internal matched maturity funds transfer pricing ftp process the goal of the ftp allocation is to encourage loan and deposit growth consistent with the websters overall profitability objectives the ftp process considers the specific interest rate risk and liquidity risk of financial instruments and other assets and liabilities in each line of business loans and leases are assigned an ftp rate for funds used and deposits are assigned an ftp rate for funds provided the allocation considers the origination date and the earlier of the maturity date or the repricing date of a financial instrument to assign an ftp rate for loans and leases and deposits originated each day the ftp process transfers the corporate interest rate risk exposure to the treasury function included within the corporate and reconciling category where such exposures are centrally managed webster allocates a majority of noninterest expense to each reportable segment using an activity and driverbased costing process costs including shared services and backoffice support areas are analyzed pooled by process and assigned to the appropriate reportable segment the combination of direct revenue direct expenses funds transfer pricing and allocations of noninterest expense produces ppnr which is the basis the segments are reviewed by executive management webster also allocates the provision for credit losses to each reportable segment based on managements

a fee substantially all of the companys commitments to extend credit are contingent upon its customers maintaining specific credit standards at the time of loan funding and are often secured by real estate collateral since the majority of the companys commitments typically expire without being funded the total contractual amount does not necessarily represent websters future payment requirements standby letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by the company to guarantee its customers performance to a third party in the event the customer does not perform in accordance with the terms of its agreement with a thirdparty webster would be required to fund the commitment the contractual amount of each standby letter of credit represents the maximum amount of potential future payments the company could be required to make historically the majority of websters standby letters of credit expire without being funded however if the commitment were funded the company has recourse against the customer websters standby letter of credit agreements are often secured by cash or other collateral commercial letters of credit are issued to finance either domestic or foreign

likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and the loss is reasonably estimable once established each accrual is adjusted to reflect any subsequent developments legal contingencies are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings may occur that could cause webster to either adjust its litigation accrual or incur actual losses that exceed the current estimate which ultimately could have a material adverse effect either individually or in the aggregate on its business financial condition or operating results webster will consider settlement of cases when it is in the best interests of the company and its stakeholders webster intends to defend itself in all claims asserted against it and management currently believes that the outcome of these contingencies will not be
