item risk factors investment in websters securities involves risks and uncertainties some of which are inherent in the financial services industry and others of which are more specific to our business the discussion below addresses the material risks and uncertainties of which we are currently aware that could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition before making an investment decision you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report if any of these events or circumstances actually occurs our business results of operations or financial condition could be significantly impacted strategic risk we may encounter significant difficulties in integrating with sterling and may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected although webster consummated its merger with sterling on january we expect integration of systems operations and personnel to continue over the next several years the successful integration of webster and sterling will depend in part on our ability to combine and manage the businesses of webster and sterling in a manner that permits growth opportunities including enhanced revenues and revenue synergies operating efficiencies an expanded market reach and that does not materially disrupt the existing customer relationships of webster or sterling nor could result in decreased revenues due to loss of customers if we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be fully realized or at all or may take longer to realize than expected failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could also result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of managements time and energy and could have an adverse effect on the combined companys business financial condition results of operations and prospects in addition it is possible that the integration process could result in the disruption of our ongoing business or cause inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger we will continue to incur substantial expenses related to the merger and integration with sterling webster has incurred and will continue to incur significant nonrecurring costs in connection with its merger with sterling as there are a large number of processes policies procedures operations technologies and systems that need to be integrated in addition the merger may increase the companys compliance and legal risks including increased litigation or regulatory actions such as fines or restrictions related to business practices or operations of the combined business while the company has planned that a certain level of expenses will be incurred there are many factors beyond websters control that could affect the total amount or timing of integration expenses further many of the expenses that will be incurred are by nature difficult to estimate accurately and could particularly in the near term exceed the anticipated cost savings that webster expects to achieve overall the amount and timing of future charges to earnings as a result of the merger and integration are uncertain and there is no assurance that the expected benefits realized will offset the transaction costs over time new lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risk on occasion we may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business there are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts particularly in instances where markets are not fully developed in developing and marketing new lines of business andor new products and services we may invest significant time and resources initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business andor new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible external factors such as compliance with regulations competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business andor a new product or service further any new line of business andor new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business andor new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people and loss of key employees may disrupt relationships with customers our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain skilled people competition for the best people in most activities in which we engage can be intense and we may not be able to hire sufficiently skilled people or retain them in addition the transition to an increased remote work environment which we believe is likely to survive the covid19 pandemic for many organizations may exacerbate the challenges of attracting and retaining skilled employees as job markets may be less constrained by physical geography the unexpected loss of services of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on the business because of their skills knowledge of our markets years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel further our business is primarily relationshipdriven in that many of our key employees have extensive customer relationships the loss of a key employee with such customer relationships may lead to the loss of business if the customers were to follow that employee to a competitor or otherwise choose to transition to another financial services provider while we believe that our relationships with key personnel is good we cannot guarantee that all of our key personnel will remain with our organization we operate in a highly competitive industry and market area we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors both within and beyond our financial markets many of which are larger and may have more financial resources than we do such competitors primarily include national regional community and internet banks within the various markets in which we operate we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions including savings and loans credit unions nonbank health savings account trustees finance companies brokerage firms insurance companies online lenders factoring companies and other financial intermediaries some of these organizations are not subject to the same degree of regulation as is imposed on bank holding companies and federally insured depository institutions which may give them greater flexibility in accessing funding and providing various services other organizations are larger than we are and may be able to achieve greater economies of scale or offer a broader range of products and services or better pricing on products and services than we can offer the financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative and regulatory changes and continued consolidation in addition as customer preferences and expectations continue to evolve technology has lowered barriers to entry and has made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks the financial services industry also faces increasing competitive pressure from the introduction of disruptive new technologies such as blockchain and digital payments often by nontraditional competitors and financial technology companies among other things technology and other changes are allowing customers to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks at one or both ends of the transaction our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including among other things the ability to develop maintain and build upon longterm customer relationships based on top quality service high ethical standards and safe sound assets the ability to expand our market position the scope relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands the rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors customer satisfaction with our level of service and products and industry and general economic trends failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position which could adversely affect our growth and profitability and in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations failure to keep pace with and adapt to technological change could adversely impact our business the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technologydriven products and services these new technologies may be superior to or render obsolete the technologies currently used in our products and services our future success depends in part upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations many of our competitors because of their larger size and available capital have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements developing or acquiring new technologies and incorporating them into our products and services may require significant investment take considerable time and ultimately may not be successful we cannot predict which technological developments or innovations will become widely adopted or how those technologies may be regulated we also may not be able to effectively market new technologydriven products and services to our customers failure to successfully keep pace with and adapt to technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations the loss of key partnerships could adversely affect our hsa bank division our hsa bank division relies on partnerships with various health insurance carriers and other partners to maximize our distribution model in particular health plan partners who provide high deductible health plan options are a significant source of new and existing hsa holders if these health plan partners or other partners choose to align with our competitors or develop their own solutions our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected financial risk difficult conditions in the us economy and financial markets may have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our business and financial performance is highly dependent upon the us economy and strength of its financial markets difficult economic and market conditions could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition in particular we could face some of the following risks and other unforeseeable risks in connection with a downturn in the us economic and market environment loss of confidence in the financial services industry and the debt and equity markets by investors placing pressure on websters common share price decreased consumer and business confidence levels may decrease credit usage and investment or increase in delinquencies and default rates decreased household or corporate incomes which could reduce demand for our products and services decreased value of collateral securing loans to borrowers causing a decrease in the asset quality of our loan and lease portfolio andor an increase in chargeoffs decreased confidence in the creditworthiness of the us government and agency securities that we hold increased concern over and scrutiny of capital and liquidity levels increased competition or consolidation in the financial services industry and increased limitations on or potential additional regulation of financial service companies the us business environment and financial markets have experienced volatility in recent years and may continue to do so in the foreseeable future the prolonged lowinterest rate environment resulting from the covid19 pandemic despite a recovering economy has presented a challenge for the financial services industry there can be no assurance that economic conditions will return to prepandemic levels or will not further worsen our profitability depends significantly on local economic conditions in the states in which we conduct business the success of our business depends on the general economic conditions of the significant markets in which we operate particularly connecticut massachusetts rhode island new york and new jersey difficult economic conditions or adverse changes in such local markets whether caused by inflation recession unemployment changes in housing or securities markets or other factors could reduce demand for our loans and deposits increase problem loans and chargeoffs cause a decline in the value of collateral securing loans and otherwise negatively affect our performance and financial condition changes in interest rates and spreads may have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our financial condition and results of operations are significantly affected by changes in market interest rates to a large degree our consolidated earnings are dependent on net interest income which is the difference between the interest income earned from our interestearning assets and the interest expense paid on our interestbearing liabilities interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control including general economic conditions the competitive environment within our markets consumer preferences for specific loan and deposit products and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies in particular the frb changes in monetary policy including changes in interest rates could influence the amount of interest we receive on loans and securities the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits and the fair market value of our financial assets and liabilities increased interest rates may decrease demand for interestrate based products and services including loans and deposits and may it more difficult for borrowers to meet obligations under variable or adjustablerate loans and other debt instruments decreased interest rates often result in increased prepayments on loans and securities as borrowers refinance their loans to reduce borrowing costs under these circumstances we are further subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that we are unable to reinvest the cash received from such prepayments that have interest rates comparable to preexisting loans and securities moreover if the rates paid on interestbearing liabilities increase at a faster rate than the yields received on interestearning assets our net interest income and therefore earnings could be adversely affected conversely earnings could also be adversely affected if the yields received on interestearning assets fall more quickly than the rates paid on interestbearing liabilities although management believes that it has designed and implemented effective asset and liability management strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on our results of operations an unexpected or prolonged period of interest rate changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations further our interest rate modeling techniques and assumption may not fully predict or capture the impact of actual interest rate changes on net interest income we may be subject to more stringent capital and liquidity requirements which could limit our business activities the holding company and webster bank are subject to capital and liquidity requirements and standards imposed as a result of the doddfrank act as amended by egrrcpa and the us basel iii capital rules regulators have and may implement changes to these standards if we fail to meet the minimum capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines and other requirements our business activities including lending and our ability to expand either organically or through acquisitions could be limited it could also result in us being required to take steps to increase our regulatory capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit our ability to pay dividends or sell or refrain from acquiring assets the holding company may not pay dividends to shareholders if it is not able to receive dividends from its subsidiary webster bank the holding company is a separate and distinct legal entity from our banking and nonbanking subsidiaries a substantial portion of the holding companys revenues comes from dividends paid by webster bank these dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends to common and preferred shareholders whether the bank is able to pay dividends depends on its ability to generate sufficient net income and meet certain regulatory requirements and the amount of such dividends may then be limited by federal and state laws in the event the bank is unable to pay the holding company dividends we may not be able to pay dividends to our common and preferred shareholders changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially impact how we report our financial results our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to understanding how we record and report our results of operations and financial condition accordingly we exercise judgment in selecting and applying these accounting policies and methods so they comply with gaap the financial accounting standards board fasb sec and other regulatory bodies that establish accounting standards periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards or the interpretation of those standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements these changes are beyond our control can be hard to predict and could materially impact how we report our results of operations and financial condition we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively which may result in us having to restate our prior period financial statements by material amounts the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make difficult subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain which include assumptions and estimates of current risks and future trends all of which may undergo material changes materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions and estimates because of the inherent uncertainty of estimates involved in preparing our financial statements we may be required to significantly adjust the financial statements as actual events unfold which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in particular we could be required to take actions that include but are not limited to increasing the acl andor sustaining credit losses that are significantly higher than the provided allowance increasing the valuation allowance on our dtas should new negative evidence become available indicating that it is more likely than not that some or a portion of our net dta will not be realized or recognizing a significant impairment charge for assets a significant merger or acquisition requires us to make estimates including the fair values of acquired assets and liabilities gaap requires us to record the assets and liabilities of an acquired business to their fair values at the time of the acquisition with larger transactions such as our recent merger with sterling fair value and other estimations can take up to four quarters to finalize these estimates and their revisions can have a substantial effect on the presentation of our financial condition and operating results after the transaction closes in addition the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired net of liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill if the estimates that we have used at any financial statement date are significantly revised in the future there could be a material negative impact on our goodwill or other acquisitionrelated intangibles and our results of operations for the period in which the revisions are made if our goodwill were determined to be impaired it could have a negative impact on our profitability gaap requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on at least an annual basis or more frequently should a triggering event occur an impairment loss is to be recognized if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit a significant decline in our expected future cash flows a continued period of local and national economic disruption changes to financial markets slower growth rates or other external factors all of which can be highly unpredictable may impact fair value calculations and require us to recognize an impairment loss in the future such impairment loss may be significant and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations our investments in certain taxadvantaged projects may not generate returns as anticipated or at all and may have an adverse impact on our results of operations we invest in certain taxadvantaged investments that support qualified affordable housing projects and other community development initiatives our investments in these projects rely on the ability of the projects to generate a return primarily through the realization of federal and state income tax credits and other tax benefits we face the risk that tax credits which remain subject to recapture by taxing authorities based on compliance with relevant requirements at the project level may not be able to be realized the risk of not being able to realize the tax credits and other tax benefits associated with a particular project depends on many factors that are outside our control a projects failure to realize these tax credits and other tax benefits may have a negative impact on our investment and as a result on our financial condition and results of operations information risk a failure or breach of our information systems or those of our thirdparty vendors and service providers including as a result of cyberattacks could disrupt our businesses result in the misuse of confidential or proprietary information damage our reputation and cause losses as a financial institution we depend on our ability to process record and monitor a large number of customer transactions accordingly our operational systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures disruptions and breakdowns our business financial accounting data processing systems or other operating systems and facilities including mobile banking and other recently developed technologies may stop operating properly or become disabled or compromised as a result of a number of factors that may be beyond our control for example there could be sudden increases in customer transaction volume electrical or telecommunications outages natural disasters pandemics events arising from political or social matters including terrorist acts and cyberattacks although we have business continuity plans and robust information security procedures and controls in place disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers or cyberattacks or security breaches of the networks systems or devices on which customers personal information is stored and that they use to access our products and services could result in customer attrition regulatory fines penalties or intervention reputational damage reimbursement or other compensation costs which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition additionally third parties with whom we do business or that facilitate our business activities including exchanges clearing houses financial intermediaries or vendors that provide services or security solutions for our operations could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us including breakdowns or failures of their own systems capacity constraints and cyberattacks in recent years information security risks for financial institutions have risen due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists hostile foreign governments activists and other external parties there have been instances involving financial services and consumerbased companies reporting unauthorized access to and disclosure of client or customer information or the destruction or theft of corporate data there have also been highly publicized cases where hackers have requested ransompayments in exchange for allowing access to systems andor not disclosing customer information in addition as a result of the covid19 pandemic and the related increase in remote working by our personnel and the personnel of other companies the risk of cyberattacks breaches or similar events whether through our systems or those of third parties on which we rely has increased although webster has not experienced any material losses relating to cyberattacks or other information security breaches there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future our inherent risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened and as a result the continued development and enhancement of our controls processes and practices designed to protect and facilitate the recovery of our systems computers software data and networks from attack damage or unauthorized access remains a high priority for us while we have purchased network and privacy liability insurance coverage which includes digital asset loss business interruption loss network security liability privacy liability network extortion and data breach coverage there can be no assurance that such insurance will cover any and all actual losses as cyber threats and related regulations continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities credit risk our allowance for credit losses on loans and leases may be insufficient we maintain an acl on loans and leases which is a reserve established through a provision for credit losses charged to expense that represents managements best estimate of probable credit losses over the life of the loan or lease within our existing portfolio the determination of the appropriate level of acl on loans and leases inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and trends using existing qualitative and quantitative information and reasonable supportable forecasts of future economic conditions all of which may undergo frequent and material changes changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers the softening of macroeconomic variables that we are more susceptible to along with new information regarding existing loans identification of additional problems loans and other factors both within and outside our control may indicate the need for an increase in the acl on loans and leases bank regulatory agencies also periodically review our acl and may require an increase in the provision for credit losses or the recognition of additional loan chargeoffs based on judgments different than those of management in addition if chargeoffs in future periods exceed the acl we may need depending on an analysis of the adequacy of the acl additional provisions to increase the acl an increase in the acl would result in a decrease in net income and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and regulatory capital position the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect our business our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients as a result defaults by or even rumors or questions about one or more financial services companies or the financial services industry in general have led and may further lead to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions many of these transactions could expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client in addition our credit risk may be impacted if the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instruments exposure due to us there is no assurance that any such losses would not materially or adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations we are subject to the risk of default by our counterparties and clients particularly with respect to certain types of loans many of our routine transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparties or clients our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices insufficient to cover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure to us in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of counterparties and clients including financial statements credit reports and other information we may also rely on representations of those counterparties clients or other third parties such as independent auditors as to the accuracy and completeness of that information the inaccuracy of that information or those representation affects our ability to accurately evaluate the default risk of a counterparty or client and could cause us to enter into unfavorable transactions which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition we consider our commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans to be higher risk categories in our loan portfolio because these loans are particularly sensitive to economic conditions commercial real estate loans generally have large balances and can be significantly affected by adverse conditions in the economy that are outside of the borrowers control because payments on such loans typically depend on the successful operation and management of the businesses that hold the loans in the case of commercial and industrial loans related collateral often consists of accounts receivable inventory and equipment this type of collateral typically does not yield substantial recovery in the event of foreclosure and may rapidly deteriorate disappear or be misdirected in advance of foreclosure in addition many of our commercial real estate and commercial and industrial borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us consequently an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship may expose us to significantly greater risk of loss the risks associated with these types of loans could have a significant negative affect on our earnings in any quarter operational and compliance risk we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision which may interfere with our ability to conduct our business operations we are subject to extensive federal and applicable state regulation and supervision primarily through webster bank and certain nonbank subsidiaries banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors the federal deposit insurance fund and the safety and soundness of the us banking system as a whole not shareholders these regulations affect our lending practices capital structure investment practices dividend policy and growth among other things congress and federal regulatory agencies continuously review banking laws regulations and policies for possible changes and proposed changes are to be expected from the current administration changes to statutes regulations or regulatory policies including changes in interpretation or implementation thereof could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways for example such changes could subject us to additional costs limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and restrict what we are able to charge for certain banking services failure to comply with laws regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies civil penalties and reputation damage which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent these types of violations there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur we face risks related to the adoption of future legislation and potential changes in federal regulatory agency leadership policies and priorities under the current administration financial institutions have recently become subject to increased scrutiny and therefore it is expected that the baking sector will be subject to more extensive legal and regulatory requirements within the next few years than under the prior presidential and congressional regime in addition changes in key personnel at the regulatory agencies including the federal banking regulators may result in differing interpretations of existing rules and guidelines including more stringent enforcement and more severe penalties than previously climate change manifesting as physical or transition risks could adversely affect our operations businesses and customers there is an increasing concern over the risks of climate change and related environmental sustainability matters the physical risks of climate change include discrete events such as flooding and wildfires and longerterm shifts in climate patterns such as extreme heat sea level rise and more frequent and prolonged drought such events could disrupt our operations those of our customers or third parties on which we rely including through direct damage to assets and indirect impacts from supply chain disruption and market volatility in addition transitioning to a lowcarbon economy may entail extensive policy legal technological and market initiatives transition risks including changes in consumer preferences and additional regulatory requirements or taxes could increase our expenses and undermine our strategies our reputation and client relationships may be damaged as a result of our practices related to climate change including our involvement or our customers involvement in certain industries or projects associated with causing or exacerbating climate change as well as any decisions we make to conduct or change our activities in response to considerations relating to climate change we have developed and continue to enhance processes to assess and monitor the banks exposure to climate however because the timing and impact of climate change has limited predictability our risk management strategies may not be effective in mitigating climate risk exposure changes in federal state or local tax laws may negatively impact our financial performance we are subject to changes in tax laws that could increase our effective tax rates or cause an increase or decrease in our income tax liabilities these law changes may be retroactive to previous periods and as a result could negatively impact our current and future financial performance on september the house ways and means committee released their proposed tax reform legislation which includes an increase in the federal corporate tax rate from to for corporations earning more than million and alters selected provisions of the internal revenue code among other changes at this time we are unable to predict whether this change or any other proposed tax law will ultimately be enacted we are subject to examinations and challenges by taxing authorities we are subject to federal and applicable state and local income tax regulations income tax regulations are often complex and require interpretation in the normal course of business we are routinely subject to examinations and challenges from federal and applicable state and local taxing authorities regarding the amount of taxes due in connection with investments we have made and the businesses in which we have engaged recently federal and state and local taxing authorities have been increasingly aggressive in challenging tax positions taken by financial institutions these tax positions may relate to compliance sales and use franchise gross receipts payroll property and income tax issues such as tax base apportionment and tax credit planning the challenges made by taxing authorities may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions if any such challenges are made and are not resolved in our favor they could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations our internal controls may be ineffective circumvented or fail management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures any system of controls however well designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system are met any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures failure to implement any necessary improvement of controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition our business may be adversely affected by fraud as a financial institution we are inherently exposed to risk in the form of theft and other fraudulent activities by employees customers or other third parties targeting webster or websters customers or data such activity may take many forms including check fraud electronic fraud wire fraud phishing social engineering and other dishonest acts although we devote substantial resources to maintaining effective policies and internal controls to identify and prevent such incidents given the increasing sophistication of possible perpetrators we may experience financial losses or reputational harm as a result of fraud health care reform could adversely affect our hsa bank division the enactment of future health care reform affecting hsas at the federal or state level may affect our hsa bank division as a bank custodian of hsas we cannot predict if any such reforms will occur ultimately become law or if enacted what the terms or regulations promulgated pursuant to such laws will be any health care reform enacted may be phased in over a number of years but could with respect to the operations of hsa bank reduce revenues increase costs and require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or put us at risk for loss of business in addition our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by such changes we rely on third parties to perform significant operational services for us third parties perform significant operational services on our behalf for instance we depend on our vendorprovided core banking processing systems to process a large number of increasingly complex transactions on a daily basis accordingly we are exposed to the risk that vendors and thirdparty service providers might not perform in accordance with their contracts or service agreements whether due to changes in their organizational structure strategic focus support for existing products technology services financial condition or for any other reason their failure to perform could be disruptive to our operations which could have a materially adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition although we require thirdparty service providers to have business continuity and disaster recovery plans that are aligned with our plans we cannot be assured that such plans will operate successfully or in a timely manner so as to prevent any such material adverse impact the replacement of libor could adversely affect our business and financial condition libor and certain other interest rate benchmarks are the subject of recent national international and other regulatory guidance and reform on march the united kingdom administrator of libor announced that the 1month 3month 6month and 12month usd libor settings would cease to exist after june and certain other libor settings including the 1week and 2month usd libor settings would cease to exist after december accordingly all existing libor obligations will transition to another benchmark after december june or earlier the us federal banking agencies issued a statement in november encouraging banks to transition away from usd libor as soon as practicable and to stop entering into new contracts that use usd libor by december central banks and regulators in major jurisdictions including the united states have convened working groups to find and implement the transition to suitable replacements for interbank offered rates to identify a successor rate for usd libor the board of governors of the federal reserve board and the frb of new york formed the arrc on july the arrc formally recommended sofr as its preferred alternative replacement rate for libor webster has adopted sofr as the libor replacement rate and began offering sofrbased lending solutions and derivative contracts to our customers in october as of january webster no longer originates new contracts using any libor index as defined by regulatory guidance the market transition away from libor to alternative reference rates is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on our business financial condition and results of operations in particular the transition could adversely affect the interest rates received or paid on the revenues and expenses associated with or the value of our liborbased assets and liabilities or the value of other securities or financial arrangements given libors role in determining market interest rates globally prompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect of our preparation and readiness for the replacement of libor with sofr as the alternative reference rate and result in disputes litigation or other actions with borrowers or counterparties about the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in liborbased contracts and securities the transition away from libor to sofr will require the transition to or development of appropriate systems models and analytics to effectively transition our risk management and other processes from liborbased products to those based on sofr webster has developed a working group steering committee and libor transition plan aligned with regulatory guidance and arrc best practices and is actively working to develop processes systems and personnel to support this transition timelines and priorities include assessing the impact on our customers as well as assessing system requirements for operational processes there can be no guarantee that our efforts will successfully mitigate the operational risks associated with the transition away from libor to sofr as the alternative reference rate the effect of these developments on our funding costs loan investment and securities portfolios is uncertain and could adversely impact our business and increase operational and legal costs legal and reputational risk we are subject to financial and reputational risks from potential liability arising from lawsuits the nature of our business ordinarily results in certain legal proceedings and claims whether claims or legal actions are founded or unfounded if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to us they may result in significant financial liability andor adversely affect how the market perceives us the products and services we offer as well as customer demand for those products and services any financial liability or reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on our business which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations we assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with outstanding legal proceedings and certain threatened claims and assessments using the latest and most reliable information for matters identified where it is probable that we will incur a loss and the amount can be reasonably estimated we will establish an accrual for the loss once established the accrual is then adjusted as needed to reflect any relevant developments however the actual cost of an outstanding legal proceeding or threatened claim and assessment may turn out to be substantially higher than the amount accrued by management we are exposed to environmental liability risk with respect to properties to which we obtain title a significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property in the normal course of business we may foreclose on and take title of properties securing certain loans and there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties if hazardous or toxic substances are found we may be held liable for remediation costs including significant investigation and cleanup costs and for personal injury or property damage in addition environmental contamination could materially reduce the affected propertys value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property although we have policies and procedures to perform environmental reviews prior to lending against or initiating any foreclosure action on real property these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards further if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site we may be subject to common law claims based on damages and costs incurred by others due to environmental contamination emanating from the property these remediation costs and liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations general risk factors our stock price can be volatile stock price volatility may make it more difficult for shareholders to resell their common stock when they want and at prices that they find attractive our stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including among other things actual or anticipated variations in results of operations recommendations or projections by securities analysts operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us news reports relating to trends concerns and other issues in the financial services and healthcare industries perceptions in the marketplace regarding us andor our competitors new technology used or services offered by competitors significant acquisitions or business combinations strategic partnerships joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving us or our competitors changes in dividends and capital returns issuance of additional shares of webster common stock changes in government regulations and geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military
