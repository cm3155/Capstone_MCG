inspects reports generated by the companys loan reporting systems related to loan production loan quality concentrations of credit loan delinquencies nonperforming loans and potential problem loans commercial nonmortgage assetbased equipment finance and warehouse lending loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding the borrowers ability to operate and service its debt assessment of the borrowers management is a critical element of the underwriting process and credit decision once it has been determined that the borrowers management possesses sound ethics and a solid business acumen current and projected cash flows are examined to determine the ability of the borrower to repay obligations as contracted commercial nonmortgage assetbased and equipment finance loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower warehouse lending loans are primarily made based on the borrowers ability to originate highquality firstmortgage residential loans that can be sold into the agency government or private jumbo markets and secondarily on the underlying cash flows of the borrower however the cash flows of borrowers may not be as expected and the collateral securing these loans as applicable may fluctuate in value most commercial nonmortgage assetbased and equipment finance loans are secured by the assets being financed and may incorporate personal guarantees of the principal balance warehouse lending loans are generally uncommitted facilities commercial real estate loans including multifamily are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to those for commercial nonmortgage assetbased equipment finance and warehouse lending loans these loans are primarily viewed as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate repayment of commercial real estate loans is largely dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loan the market in which the property is located and the tenants of the property securing the loan the properties securing the companys commercial real estate portfolio are diverse in terms of type and geographic location which reduces the companys exposure to adverse economic events that may affect a particular market management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on collateral geography and risk grade criteria all transactions are appraised to determine market value commercial real estate loans may be adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy management periodically utilizes thirdparty experts to provide insight and guidance about economic conditions and trends affecting its commercial real estate loan portfolio consumer loans are subject to policies and procedures developed to manage the specific risk characteristics of the portfolio these policies and procedures coupled with relatively small individual loan amounts and predominately collateralized loan structures are spread across many different borrowers minimizing the level of credit risk trend and outlook reports are reviewed by management on a regular basis and policies and procedures are modified or developed as needed underwriting factors for residential mortgage and home equity loans include the borrowers fico score the

for credit losses on loans and leases the acl on loans and leases increased million or from million at december to million at march due to the impact of the current macroeconomic environment on credit performance and organic loan growth the following table summarizes the percentage allocation of the acl across the loans and leases categories at march at december  in thousands amount amount commercial nonmortgage assetbased commercial real estate multifamily equipment financing warehouse lending residential home equity other consumer total acl on loans and leases the acl allocated to a single loan and lease category does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other categories methodology the companys acl on loans and leases is considered to be a critical accounting policy the acl on loans and leases is a contraasset account that offsets the amortized cost basis of loans and leases for the credit losses that are expected to occur over the life of the asset executive management reviews and advises on the adequacy of the allowance which is maintained at a level that management deems to be sufficient to cover expected losses within the loan and lease portfolios the acl on loans and leases is determined using the cecl model whereby an expected lifetime credit loss is recognized at the origination or purchase of an asset including those acquired through a business combination which is then reassessed at each reporting date over the contractual life of the asset the calculation of expected credit losses includes consideration of past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts generally expected credit losses are determined through a pooled collective assessment of loans and leases with similar risk characteristics however if the risk characteristics of a loan or lease change such that it no longer matches that of the collectively assessed pool it is removed from the population and individually assessed for credit losses the total acl on loans and leases recorded by management represents the aggregated estimated credit loss determined through both the collective and individual assessments collectively assessed loans and leases collectively assessed loans and leases are segmented based on product type credit quality risk ratings andor collateral types within its commercial and consumer portfolios and expected losses are determined using a pd lgd and ead loss rate or discounted cash flow framework for portfolios using the pdlgdead framework credit losses are calculated as the product of the probability of a loan defaulting expected loss given the occurrence of a default and the expected exposure of a loan at default summing the product across loans over their lives yields the lifetime expected credit losses for a given portfolio managements pd and lgd calculations are predictive models that measure the current risk profile of the loan pools using forecasts of future macroeconomic conditions historical loss information loanlevel risk attributes and credit quality indicators the calculation of ead follows an iterative process to determine the expected remaining principal balance of a loan based on historical paydown rates for loans of a similar segment within the same portfolio the calculation of portfolio exposure in future quarters incorporates expected losses the loans amortization schedule and prepayment rates under the loss rate method expected credit losses are estimated using a loss rate that is multiplied by the amortized cost of the asset at the balance sheet date for each loan segment identified above management applies an expected historical loss trend based on thirdparty loss estimates and correlates them to observed economic metrics and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions under the discounted cash flow method expected credit losses are determined by comparing the amortized cost of the asset at the balance sheet date to the present value of estimated future principal and interest payments expected to be collected over the remaining life of the asset the companys loss model generates cash flow projections at the loan level based on reasonable and supportable projections from which management estimates payment collections adjusted for accelerated payments recovery time pd and lgd the companys models incorporate a single economic forecast scenario and macroeconomic assumptions over a reasonable and supportable forecast period the development of the reasonable and supportable forecast assumes each macroeconomic variable will revert to longterm expectations with reversion characteristics unique to specific economic indicators and forecasts reversion towards longterm expectations generally begins two to three years from the forecast start date and is complete within three to five years certain models use output reversion and revert to mean historical portfolio loss rates on a straightline basis in the third year of the forecast other models use input reversion and revert to the mean of macroeconomic variables in reasonable and supportable forecasts the company incorporates forecasts of macroeconomic variables in the determination of expected credit losses macroeconomic variables are selected for each class of financing receivable based on relevant factors such as asset type and the correlation of the variables to credit losses among others data from the forecast scenario of these variables is used as an input to the modeled loss calculation a portion of the collective acl is comprised of qualitative adjustments for risk characteristics that are not reflected or captured in the quantitative models but are likely to impact the measurement of estimated credit losses qualitative factors are based on managements judgement of the company market industry or business specific data including loan trends portfolio segment composition and loan rating or credit scores qualitative adjustments may be applied in relation to economic forecasts when relevant facts and circumstances are expected to impact credit losses particularly in times of significant volatility in economic activity individually assessed loans and leases if the risk characteristics of a loan or lease change such that it no longer matches the risk characteristics of the collectively assessed pool it is removed from the population and individually assessed for credit losses generally all nonaccrual loans loans with a chargeoff and collateral dependent loans where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty are individually assessed the measurement method used to calculate the expected credit loss on an individually assessed loan or lease is dependent on the type and whether the loan or lease is considered to be collateral dependent methods for collateral dependent loans are either based on the fair value of the collateral less estimated cost to sell when the basis of repayment is the sale of collateral or the present value of the expected cash flows from the operation of the collateral for noncollateral dependent loans either a discounted cash flow method or other loss factor method is used any individually assessed loan or lease for which no specific valuation allowance is deemed necessary is either the result of sufficient cash flows or sufficient collateral coverage relative to the amortized cost of the asset additional information regarding the companys acl methodology can be found within note

effective assetliability management process must balance the risks and rewards from both shortterm and longterm interest rate risk when determining the companys strategy and action to facilitate this process interest rate sensitivity is monitored on an ongoing basis by the companys alco whose primary goal is to manage interest rate risk and maximize net income and net economic value over time in changing interest rate environments the alco meets frequently to make decisions on the companys investment and funding portfolios based on the economic outlook its interest rate expectations the risk position and other factors four main tools are used for managing interest rate risk the size duration and credit risk of the investment portfolio the size and duration of the wholesale funding portfolio interest rate contracts and the pricing and structure of loans and deposits management measures interest rate risk using simulation analysis and assetliability modeling software to calculate the companys earnings at risk and equity at risk interest rates are generally assumed to change up or down in a parallel fashion and the net interest income results in each scenario are compared to a flat rate base scenario the flat rate base scenario holds the end of period yield curve constant over a twelvemonth forecast horizon at march and december the flat rate base scenario assumed a federal funds rate of and respectively the federal funds rate target range was at march and at december since interest rates rose sharply in and have continued to rise during the first quarter of management has incorporated the up and down basis point rate scenarios back into its assessment of interest rate risk the following table summarizes the estimated impact that gradual parallel changes in interest rates of up and down and basis points might have on the companys net interest income over a twelvemonth period starting at march and december as compared to actual net interest income and assuming no changes in interest rates 300bp 200bp 100bp 100bp 200bp 300bp march december na na asset sensitivity in terms of net interest income decreased at march as compared to december primarily due to increased interest paid on deposits the impact of additional customer cash flow hedges entered into during the quarter and liquidity actions taken in response to bank failures loans at floors were billion at both december and march while loans with floors which are considered in the money have the impact of reducing overall asset sensitivity as interest rates continue to rise these loans will move through their floors and reprice accordingly the following table summarizes the estimated impact that yield curve twists or immediate nonparallel changes in interest rates of up and down and basis points might have on the companys net interest income for the subsequent twelvemonth period starting at march and december short end of the yield curve long end of the yield curve 100bp 50bp 50bp 100bp 100bp 50bp 50bp 100bp march december these nonparallel scenarios are modeled with the short end of the yield curve moving up or down and basis points while the long end of the yield curve remains unchanged and vice versa the short end of the yield curve is defined as terms less than eighteen months and the long end of the yield curve is defined as terms greater than eighteen months the results reflect the annualized impact of immediate interest rate changes sensitivity to both the short end and the long end of the yield curve for net interest income decreased at march as compared to december primarily due to changes in balance sheet composition the following table summarizes the estimated economic value of financial assets financial liabilities and offbalance sheet financial instruments and the corresponding estimated change in economic value if interest rates were to instantaneously increase or decrease by basis points at march and december  in thousands book value estimated economic value estimated economic value change bp bp march assets liabilities net net change as base net economic value december assets liabilities net net change as base net economic value changes in economic value can best be described through duration which is a measure of the price sensitivity of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates for fixedrate financial instruments it can be thought of as the weightedaverage expected time to receive future cash flows whereas for floatingrate financial instruments it can be thought of as the weightedaverage expected time until the next rate reset overall the longer the duration the greater the price sensitivity due to changes in interest rates generally increases in interest rates reduce the economic value of fixedrate financial assets as future discounted cash flows are worth less at higher interest rates in a rising interest rate environment the economic value of financial liabilities decreases for the same reason a reduction in the economic value of financial liabilities is a benefit to the company floatingrate financial instruments may have durations as short as one day and therefore may have very little price sensitivity due to changes in interest rates duration gap represents the difference between the duration of financial assets and financial liabilities a duration gap at or near zero would imply that the balance sheet is matched and therefore would exhibit no change in estimated economic value for changes in interest rates at march and december the companys duration gap was negative years and negative years respectively a negative duration gap implies that the duration of financial liabilities is longer than the duration of financial assets and therefore liabilities have more price sensitivity than assets and will reset their interest rates at a slower pace consequently the companys net estimated economic value would generally be expected to increase when interest rates rise as the benefit of the decreased value of financial liabilities would more than offset the decreased value of financial assets the opposite would generally be expected to occur when interest rates fall earnings would also generally be expected to increase when interest rates rise and decrease when interest rates fall over the long term absent the effects of any new business booked in the future at march longterm rates fell by basis points as compared to december these earnings and net economic value estimates are subject to factors that could cause actual results to differ and also assume that management does not take any additional action to mitigate any positive or negative effects from changing interest rates management believes that the companys interest rate risk position at march represents a reasonable level of risk given the current interest rate outlook management continues to monitor interest rates and other relevant factors given recent market volatility and is prepared to take additional action as necessary additional information regarding the companys assetliability management process can be found under the section captioned assetliability management and market risk contained in part ii item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the companys annual report on form 10k for the year ended december critical accounting estimates the preparation of the companys condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto in accordance with gaap and practices generally applicable to the financial services industry requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities while managements estimates are made based on historical experience current available information and other factors that are deemed to be relevant actual results could significantly differ from those estimates accounting estimates are necessary in the application of certain accounting policies and can be susceptible to significant change in the near term critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with gaap that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the companys financial condition or results of operations management has identified that the companys most critical accounting estimates are those related to the acl on loans and leases and business combinations accounting policies these accounting policies and their underlying estimates are discussed directly with the audit committee of the board of directors allowance for credit losses on loans and leases the acl on loans and leases is a reserve established through a provision for credit losses charged to expense which represents managements best estimate of expected lifetime credit losses within the companys loan and lease portfolios at the balance sheet date the calculation of expected credit losses is determined using predictive methods and models that follow a pdlgdead loss rate or discounted cash flow framework and include consideration of past events current conditions macroeconomic variables ie unemployment gross domestic product property values and interest rate spreads and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts changes to the acl on loans and leases and therefore to the related provision for credit losses can materially affect financial results the determination of the appropriate level of acl on loans and leases inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires the company to make significant estimates of current credit risks and trends using existing qualitative and quantitative information and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions all of which may undergo frequent and material changes changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers and macroeconomic variables that the company is more susceptible to unforeseen events such as natural disasters and pandemics along with new information regarding existing loans identification of additional problem loans the fair value of underlying collateral and other factors both within and outside the companys control may indicate the need for an increase or decrease in the acl on loans and leases it is difficult to estimate the sensitivity of how potential changes in any one economic factor or input might affect the overall reserve because a wide variety of factors and inputs are considered in estimating the acl and changes in those factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all product types further changes in factors and inputs may also be directionally inconsistent such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in others executive management reviews and advises on the adequacy of the acl on loans and leases on a quarterly basis although the overall balance is determined based on specific portfolio segments and individually assessed assets the entire balance is available to absorb credit losses for any of the loan and lease portfolios additional information regarding the determination of the acl on loans and leases
