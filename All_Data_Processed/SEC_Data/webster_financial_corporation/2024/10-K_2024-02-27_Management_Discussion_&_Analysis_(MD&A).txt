measures identified in the preceding table provide both management and investors with information useful in understanding the companys financial position results of operations the strength of its capital position and overall business performance these nongaap financial measures are used by management for performance measurement purposes as well as for internal planning and forecasting and by securities analysts investors and other interested parties to assess peer company operating performance management believes that this presentation together with the accompanying reconciliations provides investors with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the companys business and allows investors to view its performance in a similar manner tangible book value per

the tangible common equity ratio represents tangible common equity divided by total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets tangible assets both of these measures are used by management to evaluate the companys capital position the annualized return on average tangible common stockholders equity is calculated using net income available to common stockholders adjusted for the annualized taxeffected amortization of intangible assets as a percentage of average tangible common equity this measure is used by management to assess the companys performance against its peer financial institutions the efficiency ratio which represents the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue is calculated excluding certain nonoperational items in order to measure how well the company is managing its recurring operating expenses these nongaap financial measures should not be considered a substitute for gaap basis financial measures because nongaap financial measures are not

and are used by management to evaluate the comparability of the companys revenue arising from both taxable and nontaxable sources fte adjustments are determined assuming a statutory federal income tax rate of net interest income and net interest margin are influenced by the volume and mix of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities changes in interest rate levels repricing frequencies contractual maturities prepayment behavior and the use of interest rate derivative financial instruments these factors are affected by changes in economic conditions which impacts monetary policies competition for loans and deposits as well as the extent of interest lost on nonperforming assets given the merger with sterling on january net interest income for the year ended december does not reflect a full year of combined average balances and combined average yieldsrates when compared to the year ended december the timing of the sterling merger was a contributing factor to the year over year change in the majority of the companys interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities in addition to the drivers that are discussed in more detail below net interest income increased billion or from billion for the year ended december to billion for the year ended december on an fte basis net interest income also increased billion net interest margin increased basis points from for the year ended december to for the year ended december these net increases are primarily attributed to higher average loan and lease balances higher average deposit balances the impact of the higher interest rate environment and lower purchase accounting accretion on interestearning assets that were acquired from sterling average total interestearning assets increased billion or from

corporate debt securities at december and average total investment securities comprised and of average total interestearning assets respectively the average yield on total investment securities increased basis points from for the year ended december to for the year ended december primarily due to the reinvestment of funds received from securities that either had matured or were sold at higher yields average fhlb and frb stock increased billion or from billion for the year ended december to billion for the year ended december primarily due to the additional fhlb stock investment required as a result of the increase in average fhlb advances at december and average fhlb and frb stock comprised and of total average interestearning assets respectively the average yield on fhlb and frb stock increased basis points from for the year ended december to for the year ended december primarily due to the higher interest rate environment average total interestbearing liabilities

on interestbearing liabilities increased basis points from for the year ended december to for the year ended december primarily due to the higher interest rate environment average total deposits increased billion or from billion for the year ended december to billion for the year ended december reflecting an increase of billion in interestbearing deposits partially offset by a decrease of billion in noninterestbearing deposits the overall increase in deposits was primarily due to the acquisition of interlink as well as time deposit and hsa deposit growth partially offset by decreases in noninterestbearing and savings deposits the decreases in noninterest bearing and savings deposits and the increase in time deposits were driven by increased market interest rates as customers sought higher yielding deposit products december and average total deposits comprised and of average total interestbearing liabilities respectively the average rate on deposits increased basis points from for the year ended december to for the year ended december primarily due to the higher interest rate environment and growth in higher costing deposit products average higher cost time deposits as a percentage of average total interestbearing deposits increased from for the year ended december to for the year ended december primarily due to a shift in customer preferences from lower rate checking and savings products into higher rate certificates of deposit products average fhlb advances increased billion or from billion for the year ended december to billion for the year ended december primarily due to shortterm funding needs and a direct result of the companys risk management approach to hold higher levels of onbalance sheet liquidity in at december and average fhlb

the company sold million of us treasury notes corporate debt securities and municipal bonds and notes classified as availableforsale for proceeds of million which resulted in million of gross realized losses the million loss on sale of investment securities included in noninterest income for the year ended december represents the portion of the total charge that was not attributed to a decline in

the financial statement caption as a whole did not change significantly notable fluctuations were experienced in compensation and benefits occupancy technology and equipment professional and outside services deposit insurance and other expense compensation and benefits decreased million or from million for the year ended december to million for the year ended december primarily due to a million decrease in mergerrelated expenses particularly as it relates to severance and retention the outsourcing of the consumer investment services platform effective as of the fourth quarter of and decreases in incentive compensation and commissions partially offset by increases in salaries group insurance and other compensation costs occupancy decreased million or from million for the year ended december to million for the year ended december primarily due to the launch of the companys corporate real estate consolidation plan in the second quarter of which resulted in a million rou asset impairment charge and a combined million in related exit costs and accelerated depreciation on property and equipment for the year ended december there were no such charges or similar charges for the year ended december technology and equipment increased million or from million for the year ended december to million for the year ended december primarily due to an increase in technology

insurance increased million or from million for the year ended december to million for the year ended december primarily due to the million fdic special assessment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of and the impact of the increased initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules adopted by the fdic which took effect in the first quarter of for all insured depository institutions other expense decreased million or from million for the year ended december to million for the year ended december primarily due to the million common stock contribution to the webster bank charitable foundation in the third quarter of as there was no such charge for the year ended december income taxes for the years ended december and the company recognized income tax expense of million and million respectively reflecting effective tax rates of and respectively the million increase in income tax expense is primarily due the increase in pretax income in which included lower onetime charges associated with the sterling merger as compared to the point increase in the effective tax rate primarily reflects the effects of the lower onetime charges and related tax benefits in associated with the sterling merger partially offset by the effects of higher taxexempt income and lower salt expense in as compared to at december and the company recorded a valuation allowance on its dtas of million and million respectively the valuation allowance at december is primarily related to the portion of salt net operating loss carryforwards that in managements judgment is not more likely than not to be realized at december and the companys gross dtas included million and million respectively applicable to salt net operating loss and credit carryforwards that are available to offset future taxable income generally through the ultimate realization of dtas is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the net operating loss and credit carryforwards are available in making its assessment management considers the companys forecasted future results of operations estimates the content and apportionment of its income by legal entity over the near term for salt purposes and also applies longerterm growth rate assumptions based on its estimates management believes it is more likely than not that the company will realize its dtas net of the valuation allowance at december however it is possible that some or all of the companys net operating loss and credit carryforwards could expire unused or that more net operating loss and credit carryforwards could be utilized than estimated either as a result of changes in future forecasted levels of taxable income or if future economic or market conditions or interest rates were to vary significantly from the companys forecasts and in turn impact its future results of operations additional information regarding the companys income taxes including dtas can be found within note income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item financial statements and supplementary data segment reporting the companys operations are organized into three reportable segments that represent its primary businesses commercial banking hsa bank and consumer banking these segments reflect how executive management responsibilities are assigned how discrete financial information is evaluated the type of customer served and how products and services are provided segments are evaluated using ppnr certain treasury activities including the operations of interlink along with the amounts required to reconcile profitability metrics to those reported in accordance with gaap are included in the corporate and reconciling category additional information regarding the companys reportable segments and its segment reporting methodology can be found within note segment reporting in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item financial statements and supplementary data given the merger with sterling on january operating results for the commercial banking and consumer banking segments for the year ended december do not reflect a full year of combined business activities when compared to the year ended december similarly operating results for the hsa bank segment for the year ended december do not reflect a full year of business activities associated with bend given the acquisition on february the timing of both the sterling merger and bend acquisition was a contributing factor to the year over year change in their corresponding segments ppnr in addition to the drivers that are discussed in more detail throughout this section the following is a description of the companys three reportable segments and their primary services at december commercial banking serves businesses with more than million of revenue through its commercial real estate and equipment finance middle market business banking assetbased lending and commercial services public sector finance mortgage warehouse sponsor and specialty finance verticals and support private banking and treasury management business units hsa bank offers a comprehensive consumerdirected healthcare solution that includes hsas health reimbursement arrangements flexible spending accounts and commuter benefits hsas are used in conjunction with high deductible health plans in order to facilitate tax advantages for account holders with respect to health care spending and savings in accordance with applicable laws hsas are distributed nationwide directly to employers and individual consumers as well as through national and regional insurance carriers benefit consultants and financial advisors hsa bank deposits provide long duration lowcost funding that is used to minimize the companys use of wholesale funding in support of its loan growth in addition noninterest revenue is generated predominantly through service fees and interchange income consumer banking serves individual customers and small businesses with less than million of revenues by offering consumer deposits residential mortgages home equity lines secured and unsecured loans debit and credit card products and investment services consumer banking operates a distribution network consisting of banking centers and atms a customer care center and a full range of web and mobilebased banking services primarily throughout southern new england and the new york metro and suburban markets effective as of the fourth quarter of the presentation of consumer bankings operating results was impacted by the restructuring of a process by which the company offers brokerage investment advisory and certain insurancerelated services to customers the staff providing these services which had previously been employees of the bank are now employees of a thirdparty service provider as a result the company now recognizes income from this program on a net basis which thereby reduces gross reported noninterest income and corresponding compensation noninterest expense commercial banking operating results table start years ended december in thousands net interest income noninterest income noninterest expense pretax preprovision net revenue table end commercial bankings ppnr increased million or for the year ended december as compared to the year ended december due to increases in both net interest income and noninterest income partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense the million increase in net interest income is primarily due to organic loan growth the impact of the higher interest rate environment and lower deposit balances the million decrease in noninterest income is primarily due to lower customer interest rate derivative activities other loan servicing fees prepayment penalties syndication fees cash management fees and other miscellaneous income the million increase in noninterest expense is primarily due to an increase in both technology and employeerelated costs in order to support balance sheet growth selected balance sheet and offbalance sheet information table start at december in thousands loans and leases deposits assets under

commercial nonmortgage categories partially offset by net principal paydowns in the warehouse lending equipment finance and assetbased lending categories total portfolio originations for the years ended december and were billion and billion respectively the billion decrease was primarily due to a decrease in commercial real estate and commercial nonmortgage originations deposits decreased billion or at december as compared to at december primarily due to a decrease in noninterestbearing deposits as increased interest rates drove customers to seek higher yielding deposit products and other alternatives elsewhere this decrease was partially offset by the seasonal inflow of municipal deposits commercial banking held billion and billion in assets under administration and billion and

growth and the impact of the higher interest rate environment the million decrease in noninterest income is primarily due to lower net investment services income driven by the outsourcing of the consumer investment services platform in the fourth quarter of and lower deposit fees and loan servicing fee income partially offset by higher miscellaneous fee income the million decrease in noninterest expense is primarily due to lower technology and lower compensation and benefits expenses driven by the outsourcing of the consumer investment services platform effective as of the fourth

commercial loans partially offset by net principal paydowns in home equity and other consumer loans total portfolio originations for the years ended december and were billion and billion respectively the billion decrease was primarily due to the increase in market rates and low housing inventories which resulted in lower residential mortgage originations particularly mortgage refinances deposits increased billion or at december as compared to at december primarily due to the impact of the higher interest rate environment which has attracted consumers to certificates of deposit products partially offset by lower money market savings and demand deposit account balances assets under administration remained flat at billion at both december and as customer investment activities were offset by higher valuations in the equity markets during financial condition total assets increased billion or from billion at december to billion at december the change in total assets was primarily attributed to the following which experienced changes greater than million cash and cash equivalents increased million primarily due to the companys risk management approach to hold higher levels of onbalance sheet liquidity in total investment securities net increased billion reflecting increases of billion and billion in the availableforsale and heldtomaturity portfolios respectively the increase in total investment securities was primarily due to purchases exceeding paydown activities primarily across the agency mbs and agency cmbs categories partially offset by billion in sales of availableforsale us treasury notes corporate debt securities and municipal bonds and notes fhlb and frb stock decreased million primarily due to the lower fhlb stock investment required as a result of the decrease in fhlb advances loans and leases increased billion primarily due to billion of originations during the year ended december particularly across the commercial nonmortgage and commercial real estate categories partially offset by net principal paydowns and sales of commercial and consumer loans not originated for sale goodwill and other net intangible assets increased a combined million goodwill increased million which reflects the million recognized in connection with the interlink acquisition partially offset by the impact of the sterling merger measurement period adjustments recorded during the first quarter of the million increase in other net intangible assets is primarily due to the million broker dealer relationship and million noncompetition agreement recognized in connection with the interlink acquisition partially offset by amortization charges and accrued interest receivable and other assets increased million notable drivers of the change included increases in lihtc and other alternative investments and accrued interest receivable which were partially offset by decreases in miscellaneous receivables and income taxes receivable total liabilities increased billion or from billion at december to billion at december the change in total liabilities was attributed to the following total deposits increased billion reflecting a billion increase in interestbearing deposits partially offset by a billion decrease in noninterestbearing deposits the overall increase in deposits is primarily due to billion of sweep money market deposits added at december as a result of the interlink acquisition as well as time deposit and hsa deposit growth partially offset by decreases in checking and savings account products securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings decreased billion primarily due to the additional liquidity generated from the interlink deposit sweep program which allowed for a billion decrease in federal funds fhlb advances decreased billion primarily due to the additional liquidity generated from the interlink deposit sweep program which also allowed for a decrease in fhlb advances longterm debt decreased million primarily due to the repurchase and retirement of million of the senior fixedrate notes due february and accrued expenses and other liabilities increased million notable drivers of the change included increases in unfunded lihtc commitments and accrued interest payable as well as the impact of the fdic special assessment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of which were partially offset by a decrease in treasury derivative liabilities total stockholders equity increased billion or from billion at december to billion at december the change in stockholders equity was attributed to the following the adoption of asu no which resulted in a million cumulativeeffect adjustment to retained earnings net income recognized of million other comprehensive income net of tax

the company maintains and invests in debt securities that are primarily used to provide a source of liquidity for operating needs to generate interest income and as a means to manage the companys interestrate risk the companys investment securities are classified into two major categories availableforsale and heldtomaturity the alco manages the companys investment securities in accordance with regulatory guidelines and corporate policies which include limitations on aspects such as concentrations in and types of investments as well as minimum risk ratings per type of security in addition the occ may further establish individual limits on certain types of investments if the concentration in such security presents a safety and soundness concern at december and the company had total investment securities of billion and billion respectively with an average risk weighting for regulatory purposes of and respectively although the bank held the entirety of the companys investment

primarily due to purchases exceeding paydown activities particularly across the agency mbs and agency cmbs categories partially offset by sales of billion in us treasury notes corporate debt securities and municipal bonds and notes the sale of availableforsale securities during the year ended december resulted in million of gross realized losses million of which was attributed to a decline in credit quality and therefore has been included in the provision for credit losses the average fte yield on the availableforsale portfolio was for the year ended december as compared to for the year ended december the basis point increase is primarily due to higher market rates on securities purchased throughout at december and gross unrealized losses on availableforsale securities were

and no acl was recorded on availableforsale securities as each of the securities in the companys portfolio are investment grade and current as to principal and interest and their price changes are consistent with interest and credit spreads when adjusting for convexity rating and industry differences as of december based on current market conditions and the companys targeted balance sheet composition strategy the company intends to hold its availableforsale securities in unrealized loss positions through the anticipated recovery period heldtomaturity securities increased billion or

finance and warehouse lending loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding the borrowers ability to operate and service its debt assessment of the borrowers management is a critical element of the underwriting process and credit decision once it has been determined that the borrowers management possesses sound ethics and a solid business acumen current and projected cash flows are examined to determine the ability of the borrower to repay obligations as contracted commercial nonmortgage assetbased and equipment finance loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower warehouse lending loans are primarily made based on the borrowers ability to originate highquality firstmortgage residential loans that can be sold into the agency government or private jumbo markets and secondarily on the underlying cash flows of the borrower however the cash flows of borrowers may not be as expected and the collateral securing these loans as applicable may fluctuate in value most commercial nonmortgage assetbased and equipment finance loans are secured by the assets being financed and may incorporate personal guarantees of the principal balance warehouse lending loans are generally uncommitted facilities commercial real estate loans including multifamily are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to those for commercial nonmortgage assetbased equipment finance and warehouse lending loans these loans are primarily viewed as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate repayment of commercial real estate loans is largely dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loan the market in which the property is located and the tenants of the property securing the loan the properties securing the companys commercial real estate portfolio are diverse in terms of type and geographic location which reduces the companys exposure to adverse economic events that may affect a particular market management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on collateral geography and risk grade criteria all transactions are appraised to determine market value commercial real estate loans may be adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy management periodically utilizes thirdparty experts to provide insight and guidance about economic conditions and trends affecting its commercial real estate loan portfolio consumer loans are subject to policies and procedures developed to manage the specific risk characteristics of the portfolio these policies and procedures coupled with relatively small individual loan amounts and predominately collateralized loan structures are spread across many different borrowers minimizing the level of credit risk trend and outlook reports are reviewed by management on a regular basis and policies and

partially offset by net chargeoffs the following table summarizes the percentage allocation of the acl across the loans and leases categories table start at december in thousands amount amount commercial nonmortgage assetbased commercial real estate multifamily equipment financing warehouse lending residential home equity other consumer total acl on loans and leases table end the acl allocated to a single loan and lease category does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other categories methodology the companys acl on loans and leases is considered to be a critical accounting policy the acl on loans and leases is a contraasset account that offsets the amortized cost basis of loans and leases for the credit losses that are expected to occur over the life of the asset executive management reviews and advises on the adequacy of the allowance which is maintained at a level that management deems to be sufficient to cover expected losses within the loan and lease portfolios the acl on loans and leases is determined using the cecl model whereby an expected lifetime credit loss is recognized at the origination or purchase of an asset including those acquired through a business combination which is then reassessed at each reporting date over the contractual life of the asset the calculation of expected credit losses includes consideration of past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts generally expected credit losses are determined through a pooled collective assessment of loans and leases with similar risk characteristics however if the risk characteristics of a loan or lease change such that it no longer matches that of the collectively assessed pool it is removed from the population and individually assessed for credit losses the total acl on loans and leases recorded by management represents the aggregated estimated credit loss determined through both the collective and individual assessments collectively assessed loans and leases collectively assessed loans and leases are segmented based on product type and credit quality and expected losses are determined using models that follow a pd lgd ead or loss rate framework for portfolios using the pd lgd and ead framework expected credit losses are calculated as the product of the probability of a loan defaulting expected loss given the occurrence of a default and the expected exposure of a loan at default summing the product across loans over their lives yields the lifetime expected credit losses for a given portfolio the companys pd and lgd calculations are predictive models that measure the current risk profile of the loan pools using forecasts of future macroeconomic conditions historical loss information loanlevel risk attributes and credit quality indicators the calculation of ead follows an iterative process to determine the expected remaining principal balance of a loan based on historical paydown rates for loans of a similar segment within the same portfolio the calculation of portfolio exposure in future quarters incorporates expected losses the loans amortization schedule and prepayment rates under the loss rate framework expected credit losses are estimated using a loss rate that is multiplied by the amortized cost of the asset at the balance sheet date for each loan segment identified management applies an expected historical loss trend based on thirdparty loss estimates and correlates them to observed economic metrics and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions the companys models incorporate a single economic forecast scenario and macroeconomic assumptions over a reasonable and supportable forecast period the development of the reasonable and supportable forecast assumes each macroeconomic variable will revert to longterm expectations with reversion characteristics unique to specific economic indicators and forecasts reversion towards longterm expectations generally begins two to three years from the forecast start date and is complete within three to five years certain models use output reversion and revert to mean historical portfolio loss rates on a straightline basis in the third year of the forecast other models incorporate a reasonable and supportable forecast of various macroeconomic variables over the remaining life of the companys assets the company incorporates forecasts of macroeconomic variables in the determination of expected credit losses macroeconomic variables are selected for each class of financing receivable based on relevant factors such as asset type and the correlation of the variables to credit losses among others data from the forecast scenario of these macroeconomic variables are used as inputs to the modeled loss calculation a portion of the collective acl is comprised of qualitative adjustments for risk characteristics that are not reflected or captured in the quantitative models but are likely to impact the measurement of estimated credit losses qualitative factors are based on managements judgement of the company market industry or business specific data including loan trends portfolio segment composition and loan rating or credit scores qualitative adjustments may be applied in relation to economic forecasts when relevant facts and circumstances are expected to impact credit losses particularly in times of significant volatility in economic activity individually assessed loans and leases if the risk characteristics of a loan or lease change such that it no longer matches the risk characteristics of the collectively assessed pool it is removed from the population and individually assessed for credit losses generally all nonaccrual loans and loans with a chargeoff are individually assessed the measurement method used to calculate the expected credit loss on an individually assessed loan or lease is dependent on the type and whether the loan or lease is considered to be collateral dependent methods for collateral dependent loans are either based on the fair value of the collateral less estimated cost to sell when the basis of repayment is the sale of collateral or the present value of the expected cash flows from the operation of the collateral for noncollateral dependent loans either a discounted cash flow method or other loss factor method is used any individually assessed loan or lease for which no specific valuation allowance is deemed necessary is either the result of sufficient cash flows or sufficient collateral

in part ii item financial statements and supplementary data assetliability management and market risk an effective assetliability management process must balance the risks and rewards from both shortterm and longterm interest rate risk when determining the companys strategy and action to facilitate this process interest rate sensitivity is monitored on an ongoing basis by the companys alco whose primary goal is to manage interest rate risk and maximize net income and net economic value over time in changing interest rate environments limits for earnings at risk are set for parallel ramps in interest rates over a twelvemonth period of up and down and basis points and for interest rate curve twist shocks of up and down and basis points limits for net economic value referred to as equity at risk are set for parallel shocks in interest rates of up and down and basis points the alco also regularly reviews earnings at risk scenarios for nonparallel changes in interest rates as well as longerterm earnings at risk for up to four years in the future management measures interest rate risk using simulation analysis and assetliability modeling software to calculate the companys earnings at risk and equity at risk key assumptions relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads prepayment speeds and the runoff of deposits from these simulations interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are formulated and implemented earnings at risk is defined as the change in net interest income due to changes in interest rates essentially interest rates are assumed to change up or down in a parallel fashion and the net interest income results in each scenario are compared to a flat rate base scenario the flat rate base scenario holds the end of period yield curve constant over a twelvemonth forecast horizon the earnings at risk simulation analysis incorporates assumptions about balance sheet changes ie product mix growth and loan and deposit pricing overall it is a measure of shortterm interest rate risk at december and the flat rate base scenario assumed a federal funds rate of and respectively the federal funds rate target range was at december and at december since interest rates rose sharply throughout and continued to rise into the third quarter of management has incorporated the up and down basis point rate scenarios back into its assessment of interest rate risk equity at risk is defined as the change in the net economic value of financial assets and financial liabilities due to changes in interest rates compared to a base net economic value equity at risk analyzes sensitivity in the present value of cash flows over the expected life of existing financial assets financial liabilities and offbalance sheet financial instruments it is a measure of the longterm interest rate risk to future earnings streams embedded in the current balance sheet asset sensitivity is defined as earnings or net economic value increasing when interest rates rise and decreasing when interest rates fall as compared to a base scenario in other words financial assets are more sensitive to changing interest rates than liabilities and therefore reprice faster likewise liability sensitivity is defined as earnings or net economic value decreasing when interest rates rise and increasing when interest rates fall as compared to a base scenario key assumptions underlying the present value of cash flows include the behavior of interest rates and spreads asset prepayment speeds and attrition rates on deposits cash flow projections from the model are compared to market expectations for similar collateral types and adjusted based on experience with the banks own portfolio the models valuation results are compared to observable market prices for similar instruments whenever possible the behavior of deposit and loan customers is studied using historical time series analysis to model future customer behavior under varying interest rate environments the equity at risk simulation process uses multiple interest rate paths generated by an arbitragefree trinomial lattice term structure model the base case rate scenario against which all others are compared currently uses the monthend sofrswap yield curve as a starting point to derive forward rates for future months using interest rate swap option volatilities as inputs the model creates multiple rate paths for this scenario with forward rates as the mean in shock scenarios the starting yield curve is shocked up or down in a parallel fashion future rate paths are then constructed in a similar manner to the base case scenario cash flows for all financial instruments are generated using product specific prepayment models and account specific system data for properties such as maturity date amortization type coupon rate repricing frequency and repricing date the assetliability simulation software is enhanced with a mortgage prepayment model and a collateralized mortgage obligation database financial instruments with explicit options ie caps floors puts and calls and implicit options ie prepayment and early withdrawal abilities require such modeling approach to quantify value and risk more accurately on the asset side risk is impacted the most by residential mortgage loans and mortgagebacked securities which can typically prepay at any time without penalty and may have embedded caps and floors in the loan portfolio floors are a benefit to interest income in low interest rate environments floatingrate loans at floors pay a higher interest rate than a loan at a fully indexed rate without a floor as with a floor there is a limit on how low the interest rate can fall as market rates rise however the interest rate paid on these loans does not rise until the fully indexed rate rises through the contractual floor on the liability side there is a large concentration of customers with indeterminate maturity deposits who have options to add or withdraw funds from their accounts at any time implicit floors on deposits based on historical data are modeled the bank also has the option to change the interest rate paid on these deposits at any time four main tools are used for managing interest rate risk the size duration and credit risk of the investment portfolio the size and duration of the wholesale funding portfolio interest rate contracts and the pricing and structure of loans and deposits the alco meets frequently to make decisions on the investment and funding portfolios based on the economic outlook its interest rate expectations the risk position and other factors the alco delegates pricing and product design responsibilities to individuals and subcommittees but continuously monitors and influences their actions on a regular basis various interest rate contracts including futures options swaps caps and floors can be used to manage interest rate risk these contracts involve to varying degrees levels of credit and interest rate risk the notional amount of the derivative instrument or the amount from which interest and other payments are derived is not exchanged and therefore should not be used as a measure of credit risk in addition certain derivative instruments are used by the bank to manage the risk of loss associated with its mortgage banking activities generally prior to closing and funds disbursement an interestrate lock commitment is extended to the borrower during this time the bank is subject to the risk that market interest rates may change which could impact pricing on loan sales in an effort to mitigate this risk the bank establishes forward delivery sales commitments thereby setting the sales price the company will also hold futures options and forward foreign currency exchange contracts to minimize the price volatility of certain financial assets and financial liabilities changes in the market value of these derivative positions are recognized in earnings additional information regarding derivatives can be found within note derivative financial instruments in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item financial statements and supplementary data the following table summarizes the estimated impact that gradual parallel changes in interest rates of up and down and basis points might have on the companys net interest income over a twelvemonth period starting at december and as compared to actual net interest income and assuming no changes in interest rates table start 300bp 200bp 100bp 100bp 200bp 300bp december december na na table end asset sensitivity in terms of net interest income decreased at december as compared to at december primarily due to changes in the overall balance sheet composition which included the addition of billion in pricesensitive deposits from interlink an increase in interest paid on deposits and the implementation of incremental asset sensitivity measures such as hedges and the investment of fixedrate debt securities to extend duration loans at floors were billion and billion at december and respectively while loans with floors which are considered in the money have the impact of reducing overall asset sensitivity as interest rates continue to rise these loans will move through their floors and reprice accordingly the following table summarizes the estimated impact that yield curve twists or immediate nonparallel changes in interest rates of up and down and basis points might have on the companys net interest income for the subsequent twelvemonth period starting at december and table start short end of the yield curve long end of the yield curve 100bp 50bp 50bp 100bp 100bp 50bp 50bp 100bp december december table end these nonparallel scenarios are modeled with the short end of the yield curve moving up or down and basis points while the long end of the yield curve remains unchanged and vice versa the short end of the yield curve is defined as terms less than eighteen months and the long end of the yield curve is defined as terms greater than eighteen months the results reflect the annualized impact of immediate interest rate changes sensitivity to the both the short end and long end of the yield curve for net interest income decreased at december as compared to december primarily due to changes in the overall balance sheet composition the following table summarizes the estimated economic value of financial assets financial liabilities and offbalance sheet financial instruments and the corresponding estimated change in economic value if interest rates were to instantaneously increase or decrease by basis points at december and table start book value estimated economic value estimated economic value change in thousands 100bp 100bp at december assets liabilities net net change as base net economic value at december assets liabilities net net change as base net economic value table end changes in economic value can best be described through duration which is a measure of the price sensitivity of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates for fixedrate financial instruments it can be thought of as the weightedaverage expected time to receive future cash flows whereas for floatingrate financial instruments it can be thought of as the weightedaverage expected time until the next rate reset overall the longer the duration the greater the price sensitivity due to changes in interest rates generally increases in interest rates reduce the economic value of fixedrate financial assets as future discounted cash flows are worth less at higher interest rates in a rising interest rate environment the economic value of financial liabilities decreases for the same reason a reduction in the economic value of financial liabilities is a benefit to the company floatingrate financial instruments may have durations as short as one day and therefore may have very little price sensitivity due to changes in interest rates duration gap represents the difference between the duration of financial assets and financial liabilities a duration gap at or near zero would imply that the balance sheet is matched and therefore would exhibit no change in estimated economic value for changes in interest rates at december and the companys duration gap was negative years and negative years respectively a negative duration gap implies that the duration of financial liabilities is longer than the duration of financial assets and therefore liabilities have more price sensitivity than assets and will reset their interest rates at a slower pace consequently the companys net estimated economic value would generally be expected to increase when interest rates rise as the benefit of the decreased value of financial liabilities would more than offset the decreased value of financial assets the opposite would generally be expected to occur when interest rates fall earnings would also generally be expected to increase when interest rates rise and decrease when interest rates fall over the long term absent the effects of any new business booked in the future these earnings and net economic value estimates are subject to factors that could cause actual results to differ and also assume that management does not take any additional action to mitigate any positive or negative effects from changing interest rates management believes that the companys interest rate risk position at december represents a reasonable level of risk given the current interest rate outlook management continues to monitor interest rates and other relevant factors given recent market volatility and is prepared to take additional action as necessary critical accounting estimates the preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto in accordance with gaap and practices generally applicable to the financial services industry requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities while managements estimates are made based on historical experience current available information and other factors that are deemed to be relevant actual results could significantly differ from those estimates accounting estimates are necessary in the application of certain accounting policies and can be susceptible to significant change in the near term critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with gaap that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the companys financial condition or results of operations management has identified that the companys most critical accounting estimates are those related to the acl on loans and leases and business combinations accounting policies these accounting policies and their underlying estimates are discussed directly with the audit committee of the board of directors allowance for credit losses on loans and leases the acl on loans and leases is a reserve established through a provision for credit losses charged to expense which represents managements best estimate of expected lifetime credit losses within the companys loan and lease portfolios at the balance sheet date the calculation of expected credit losses is determined using predictive methods and models that follow a pd lgd ead or loss rate framework and include consideration of past events current conditions macroeconomic variables ie unemployment gross domestic product property values and interest rate spreads and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts changes to the acl on loans and leases and therefore to the related provision for credit losses can materially affect financial results the determination of the appropriate level of acl on loans and leases inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires the company to make significant estimates of current credit risks and trends using existing qualitative and quantitative information and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions all of which may undergo frequent and material changes changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers and macroeconomic variables that the company is more susceptible to unforeseen events such as natural disasters and pandemics along with new information regarding existing loans identification of additional problem loans the fair value of underlying collateral and other factors both within and outside the companys control may indicate the need for an increase or decrease in the acl on loans and leases it is difficult to estimate the sensitivity of how potential changes in any one economic factor or input might affect the overall reserve because a wide variety of factors and inputs are considered in estimating the acl and changes in those factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all product types further changes in factors and inputs may also be directionally inconsistent such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in others executive management reviews and advises on the adequacy of the acl on loans and leases on a quarterly basis although the overall balance is determined based on specific portfolio segments and individually assessed assets the entire balance is available to absorb credit losses for any of the loan and lease portfolios additional information regarding the determination of the acl on loans and leases including the companys valuation methodology can be found in part ii under the section captioned allowance for credit losses on loans and leases contained elsewhere in this item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and within note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item financial statements and supplementary data business combinations the acquisition method of accounting generally requires that the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date the determination of fair value often involves the use of internal or thirdparty valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow analyses or appraisals particularly the valuation techniques used to estimate the fair value of loans and leases and the core deposit intangible asset acquired in the sterling merger include estimates related to discount rates credit risk and other relevant factors which are inherently subjective a description of the valuation methodologies used to estimate the fair values of the significant assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the sterling merger can be found within note mergers and acquisitions in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item financial statements and
