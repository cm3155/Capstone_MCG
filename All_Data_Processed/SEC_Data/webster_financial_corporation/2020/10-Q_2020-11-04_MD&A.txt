notes thereto for the year ended december included in the companys annual report on season selected balance sheet and offbalance sheet information in thousands at september at december deposits assets under administration through linked brokerage accounts offbalance sheet total footings deposits increased million at september compared to december due to organic growth in existing account balances and an acquired portfolio deposit growth was partially offset by the exit of thirdpartyadministrator accounts in the second quarter hsa bank deposits accounted for and of total deposits at september and december respectively assets under administration through linked brokerage accounts increased million at september compared to december primarily due to new investment account growth and market value increases community banking operating results three months ended september nine months ended september in thousands net interest income noninterest income noninterest expense pretax preprovision net revenue comparison to prior year quarter pretax preprovision net revenue increased million or for the three months ended september as compared to the same period in net interest income increased million as a result of loan and deposit growth partially offset by the impact of the lower rate environment noninterest income increased million driven by increased fee income from mortgage banking activities partially offset by lower deposit related fees and investment services fees noninterest expense decreased million primarily resulting from lower operations costs as well as a business optimization charge taken in comparison to prior year to date pretax preprovision net revenue decreased million or for the nine months ended september as compared to the same period in net interest income decreased million as a result of the lower interest rate environment partially offset by loan and deposit growth noninterest income decreased million as a result of lower deposit related fees loan servicing income and fees from investment services partially offset by increased fee income from mortgage banking activities noninterest expense increased million primarily due to higher employee related expenses continued investments in technology and other corporate overhead mostly offset by decreased deposit and loan operations costs marketing expenses sales activity related expenses and card processing costs selected balance sheet and offbalance sheet information in thousands at september at december loans deposits assets under administration offbalance sheet loans increased million at september compared to december the increase is due to the originations of ppp loans by business banking partially offset by lower residential mortgage balances due to increased refinancing activity and the continuing net paydowns in the home equity portfolio loan originations in the nine months ended september and were billion and billion respectively the increase was driven by the originations of the ppp loans and increased residential mortgage originations partially offset by a decline in home equity originations ppp loans at september were million deposits increased billion at september compared to december resulting from higher balances in business and consumer transactional accounts coupled with increases in savings and money market products the balance increases were driven by proceeds from the ppp loans cares act stimulus payments and the shifting of deposits from maturing certificates of deposits webster banks investment services division had assets under administration through its strategic partnership with lpl of billion at both september and december financial condition at september total assets of billion increased by billion compared to december primarily driven by increases of billion in loans million in investment securities and million in accrued interest receivable and other assets total liabilities of billion increased by billion compared to december primarily reflecting increases of billion in demand deposits billion in interestbearing deposits and million in hsas total shareholders equity of billion increased by million compared to december the increase in shareholders equity reflects million of net income and million of other comprehensive income partially offset by a million decrease in connection with the common stock repurchase program a million decrease for a cumulative effect of change in accounting principles in connection with the adoption of cecl and million and million in dividends paid to common and preferred shareholders respectively book value was per common share as of september compared with per common share as of december on october the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend to shareholders maintaining it at per common share given the current economic forecast anticipated earnings and capital position the company anticipates continuation of the dividend at its current level the company will continue to monitor its ability to pay dividends at this level as of september both the company and the bank were considered wellcapitalized meeting all capital requirements under the basel iii capital rules in accordance with regulatory capital rules the company elected an option to delay the impact of cecl on its regulatory capital over a twoyear deferral and subsequent threeyear transition period ending december therefore capital ratios and amounts as of september exclude the impact of the increased allowance for credit losses on loans and leases heldtomaturity debt securities and unfunded loan commitments attributed to the adoption of cecl this resulted in a and basis point benefit to the companys cet1 risk based capital total risk based capital tier risk based

activity within an acceptable level of risk management reviews and approves these policies and procedures on a regular basis to assist management with its review reports related to loan production loan quality concentrations of credit loan delinquencies nonperforming loans and potential problem loans are generated by loan reporting systems the company has implemented additional monitoring procedures in connection with covid19 commercial loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding the borrowers ability to operate and service its debt assessment of management is a critical element of the underwriting process and credit decision once it is determined that the borrowers management possesses sound ethics and solid business acumen current and projected cash flows are examined to determine the ability of the borrower to repay obligations as agreed all transactions are appraised to determine market value commercial and industrial loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower the cash flows of borrowers however may not be as expected and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value most commercial and industrial loans are secured by the assets being financed and may incorporate personal guarantees of the principals commercial real estate loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial and industrial loans in addition to those specific to real estate loans these loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate repayment of these loans is largely dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loan the market in which the property is located and the tenants of the property securing the loan the properties securing the companys commercial real estate portfolio are diverse in terms of type and geographic location which reduces the companys exposure to adverse economic events that may affect a particular market management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on collateral geography and risk grade criteria commercial real estate loans may be adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy management periodically utilizes thirdparty experts to provide insight and guidance about economic conditions and trends affecting its commercial real estate loan portfolio consumer loans are subject to policies and procedures developed to manage the risk characteristics of the portfolio policies and procedures coupled with relatively small individual loan amounts and predominately collateralized structures spread across many different borrowers minimize risk trend and outlook reports are reviewed by management on a regular basis with policies and procedures modified or developed as needed underwriting factors for mortgage and home equity loans include the borrowers fair isaac corporation fico score the loan amount relative to property value and the borrowers debt to income level and are also influenced by regulatory requirements additionally webster bank originates both qualified mortgage and nonqualified mortgage loans as defined by applicable consumer financial protection bureau cfpb rules loan modifications webster works with customers to modify loan agreements when borrowers are experiencing financial difficulty webster will modify a loan to minimize the risk of loss and achieve the best possible outcome for both the borrower and the company loan modifications can take various forms including payment deferral rate reduction covenant waiver term extension or other action depending on the nature of modification it may or may not be accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring tdr covid19 payment modification activities the company has accommodated over customers impacted by covid19 through paymentrelated deferrals as of september loan balances associated with these modifications in their deferral period totaled approximately million this balance includes all loans associated with a customer relationship where at least one loan has been modified or is in process of modification a significant portion of the loan balances associated with these modifications would not be considered a tdr based on the nature of the modification certain other modifications that would otherwise be considered a tdr are subject to tdr accounting relief through the cares act and interagency statement included in the million are million of loan balances associated with the cares act and interagency statement as discussed below the company continues to actively monitor customer relationships associated with these modified loans the impact of these modifications is reflected in our allowance for credit losses on loans and leases the cares act and interagency statement in response to the covid19 pandemic financial institutions were provided relief from certain tdr accounting and disclosure requirements for qualifying loan modifications specifically section of the cares act provided temporary relief from certain gaap requirements for modifications related to covid19 in addition a group of banking regulatory agencies issued a revised interagency statement that offers practical expedients for evaluating whether covid19 loan modifications are tdrs as of september loan balances associated with loan modifications designated in connection with these relief provisions in their deferral period totaled approximately million these modifications represent payment deferrals generally three to six months in length the decrease of million from million at june is the result of borrowers exiting their payment deferral period as of september of the loan balances that have exited their deferral period are contractually current the company will continue to evaluate the effectiveness of the loan modification program as the deferral periods end for additional information on the accounting for loan modifications under section of the cares act and the revised interagency statement refer to note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report troubled debt restructurings a modified loan is considered a tdr when two conditions are met i the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and ii the modification constitutes a concession modified terms are dependent upon the financial position and needs of the individual borrower the company considers all aspects of the restructuring in determining whether a concession has been granted including the debtors ability to access market rate funds in general a concession exists when the modified terms of the loan are more attractive to the borrower than standard market terms common modifications include material changes in covenants pricing and forbearance loans for which the borrower has been discharged under chapter bankruptcy are considered collateral dependent tdrs and thus impaired at the date of discharge and charged down to the fair value of collateral less cost to sell the companys policy is to place consumer loan tdrs except those that were performing prior to tdr status on nonaccrual status for a minimum period of six months commercial tdrs are evaluated on a casebycase basis for determination of accrual status loans qualify for return to accrual status once they have demonstrated performance with the restructured terms of the loan agreement for a minimum of six months generally a tdr is classified and reported as a tdr for the remaining life of the loan tdr classification may be removed if the loan was restructured under market conditions and the borrower demonstrates compliance with the modified terms for a minimum of six months in the limited circumstance that a loan is removed from tdr classification it is the companys policy to continue to base its measure of credit loss on the contractual terms specified by the loan agreement the following tables provide information for tdrs nine months ended september in

leveraging established risk tolerance levels through its underwriting standards servicing and portfolio management of loans and leases loans and leases particularly where a heightened risk of loss has been identified are regularly monitored to mitigate further deterioration which could potentially impact key measures of asset quality in future periods past due loans and leases nonperforming assets

net chargeoffs calculated for the september period based on the yeartodate net chargeoffs annualized the ratios as calculated above include the impact of ppp loans totaling billion for which there was no allowance for credit losses recorded at september the economic environment and uncertainty related to the pandemic could result in severe deterioration of asset quality particularly in sectors disproportionately impacted from covid19 and the related economic slowdown such as retail transportation leisure construction restaurants hotels and oil at september commercial loans with exposure to these sectors totaled billion or approximately of total loans potential problem loans and leases potential problem loans and leases are defined by management as certain loans and leases that for the commercial portfolio are performing loans and leases that are classified as substandard and have a welldefined weakness that could jeopardize the full repayment of the debt and the consumer portfolio are performing loans that are days past due and accruing potential problem loans and leases exclude loans and leases past due days or more and accruing nonaccrual loans and leases and troubled debt restructurings tdrs certain loans with modifications related to covid19 are not reflected as potential problem loans and are not reported as tdrs due to relief provisions of the cares act and interagency statements as discussed elsewhere in this document as there are many uncertainties related to the pandemic there is a risk that some of these modified loans may become potential problem loans management monitors potential problem loans and leases due to a higher degree of risk associated with those loans and leases the current expectation of lifetime losses is included in the acl on loans and leases however management cannot predict whether these potential problem loans and leases ultimately will become nonperforming or result in a loss the company had potential problem loans and leases of million at september compared to million at december allowance for credit losses on loans and leases on january the company adopted a new accounting standard which introduced the cecl impairment model that applies to most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments including the companys loans net investment in leases offbalance sheet credit exposures and heldtomaturity debt securities cecl requires the measurement of expected credit losses over the life of the instrument to be recognized at purchase or origination and also requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information including economic forecasts methodology the companys policy for acl on loans and leases is considered a critical accounting policy the acl on loans and leases is a contraasset account that offsets the amortized cost basis of loans and leases for the credit losses expected to occur over the life of the asset executive management reviews and advises on the adequacy of the reserve which is maintained at a level management deems sufficient to cover expected losses within the loan and lease portfolios the acl on loans and leases is determined using the cecl model which requires recognition of expected lifetime credit losses at the purchase or origination of an asset expected losses are determined through pooled collective assessment of loans and leases with similar risk characteristics if the risk characteristics of a loan or lease change and no longer match that of the collective assessment pool it is removed and individually assessed for credit impairment management applies significant judgments and assumptions that influence the loss estimate and acl on loan and lease balances collectively assessed loans and leases collectively assessed loans and leases are segmented based on the commercial and consumer portfolios and expected losses are determined using a probability of defaultloss given defaultexposure at default pdlgdead framework expected credit losses are calculated as the product of the probability of a loan defaulting expected loss given the occurrence of a default and the current exposure of a loan at default summing the product across loans and across time yields the lifetime expected credit losses for a given portfolio the companys pd and lgd calculations are predictive models that measure the current risk profile of the loan pools using forecasts of future macroeconomic conditions historical loss information and credit risk ratings the companys models incorporate a single economic forecast scenario and macroeconomic assumptions over a reasonable and supportable forecast period after the reasonable and supportable forecast period the company reverts on a straightline basis to its historical loss rates evaluated over the historical observation period for the remaining life of the loans and leases the calculation of exposure at default follows an iterative process to determine the expected remaining principal balance of a loan based on historical paydown rates for loans of similar segment within the same portfolio the calculation of portfolio exposure in future quarters incorporates expected losses and principal paydown ppd ppd is the combination of contractual repayment and prepayment a portion of the collective acl is comprised of qualitative adjustments for risk characteristics which are not reflected or captured in the quantitative models but are likely to impact the measurement of estimated credit losses macroeconomic variables are used as inputs to the loss models and are selected based on the correlation of the variables to credit losses for each class of financing receivable as follows the commercial model uses unemployment gross domestic product gdp and retail sales the residential model uses the case shiller home price index home equity loan and line of credit models use interest rate spreads between us treasuries and corporate bonds and the home equity loan model also uses the federal housing finance agency fhfa home price index personal loan and credit line models use the case shiller and fhfa home price indices forecasted economic scenarios are sourced from a third party data from the baseline forecast scenario is used as the input to the modeled loss calculation changes in forecasts of macroeconomic variables will impact expectations of lifetime credit losses calculated by the loss models however the impact of changes in macroeconomic forecasts may be different for each portfolio and will reflect the credit quality and nature of the underlying assets at that time to further refine the expected loss estimate qualitative factors are applied in the loss calculation including credit concentration credit quality trends the quality of internal loan reviews the nature and volume of portfolio growth staffing levels underwriting exceptions and economic considerations not reflected in the base loss model management may apply additional qualitative adjustments to reflect their assessment of other relevant facts and circumstances that impact expected credit losses these economic and qualitative inputs are used to forecast expected losses over a reasonable and supportable forecast period the company uses a 2year reasonable and supportable forecast period after which loss rates revert to historical loss rates on a linear basis over a 1year period historical loss rates are based on approximately years of recently available data and are updated annually in addition to the above considerations the collective assessment calculation includes expectations of prepayments and expected recoveries extensions renewals and modifications are not included in the collective assessment however if there is a reasonable expectation of a tdr the loan is removed from the collective assessment pool and is individually assessed individually assessed loans and leases when loans and leases no longer match the risk characteristics of the collective assessment pool they are removed from the collectively assessed population and individually assessed for credit losses generally all nonaccrual loans tdrs potential tdrs loans with a chargeoff and collateral dependent loans when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty are individually assessed individual assessment for collateral dependent commercial loans facing financial difficulty is based on the fair value of the collateral less estimated cost to sell or the present value of the expected cash flows from the operation of the collateral or a scenario weighted approach of both of these methods if a loan is not collateral dependent the individual assessment is based on a discounted cash flow approach for collateral dependent commercial loans and leases websters impairment process requires the company to determine the fair value of the collateral by obtaining a thirdparty appraisal or asset valuation an interim valuation analysis blue book reference or other internal methods fair value of the collateral for commercial loans is reevaluated quarterly whenever the company has a thirdparty real estate appraisal performed by independent licensed appraisers a licensed inhouse appraisal officer or qualified individual reviews these appraisals for compliance with the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act and the uniform standards of professional appraisal practice individual assessments for residential and home equity loans are based on a discounted cash flow approach or the fair value of collateral less the estimated costs to sell other consumer loans are individually assessed using a loss factor approach based on historical loss rates for residential and consumer collateral dependent loans a thirdparty appraisal is obtained upon loan default fair value of the collateral for residential and consumer collateral dependent loans is reevaluated every six months by either obtaining a new appraisal or other internal valuation method fair value is also reassessed with any excess amount charged off for residential and home equity loans that reach days past due per federal financial institutions examination council guidelines a fair value shortfall relative to the amortized cost balance is reflected as an impairment reserve within the acl on loans and leases subsequent to an appraisal or other fair value estimate should reliable information come to managements attention that the value has declined further additional impairment may be recorded to reflect the particular situation thereby increasing the acl on loans and leases any individually assessed loan for which no specific valuation allowance was necessary at september and december is the result of either sufficient cash flow or sufficient collateral coverage relative to the amortized cost if the credit quality subsequently improves the allowance is reversed up to a maximum of the previously recorded credit losses the acl on loans and leases represents the total of estimated losses calculated through collective and individual assessments to assist management with its review reports related to loan production loan quality concentrations of credit loan delinquencies nonperforming loans and potential problem loans are generated by loan reporting systems while actual future conditions and losses realized may vary significantly from present judgments and assumptions management believes the acl on loans and leases is adequate as of september allowance for credit losses on loans and leases balances and ratios the company adopted the cecl accounting standard on january with a cumulative effect adjustment recorded upon adoption which increased the acl on loans and leases by million upon adoption the allowance reflects expected lifetime credit losses of the portfolio the companys acl calculation reflects managements best estimate of expected lifetime credit losses as of period end including current forecasts of macroeconomic activity and borrower risk ratings at september the acl on loans and leases was million compared to million at december the increase of million in the reserve at september compared to december is primarily due to the adoption of cecl and the impact of covid19 acl on loans and leases as a percentage of loans and leases also known as the reserve coverage increased to at september from at december reflecting lifetime credit losses under cecl and the impact of covid19 acl on loans and leases as a percentage of nonperforming loans and leases

amounts such transactions are utilized in the normal course of business for general corporate purposes or for customer financing needs corporate purpose transactions are structured to manage credit interest rate and liquidity risks or to optimize capital customer transactions are structured to manage their funding requirements or facilitate certain trade arrangements these transactions give rise to in varying degrees elements of credit interest rate and liquidity risk for additional information refer to note variable interest entities and note commitments and contingencies in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report assetliability management and market risk an effective assetliability management process must balance the risks and rewards from both short and longterm interest rate risks in determining management strategy and action to facilitate and manage this process interest rate sensitivity is monitored on an ongoing basis by the companys alco the impact has not been calculated for scenarios which would require negative interest rates the following table summarizes the estimated impact that gradual parallel changes in interest rates of and basis points might have on net interest income over a twelve month period starting september and december for each subsequent twelve month period as compared to nii assuming no

200bp september na na december na interest rates are assumed to change up or down in a parallel fashion and nii and ppnr results in each scenario are compared to a flat rate scenario as a base the flat rate scenario holds the end of period yield curve constant over a twelve month forecast horizon the flat rate scenario as of september and december assumed a fed funds rate of and respectively asset sensitivity for both nii and ppnr was lower as of september when compared to december for the majority of scenarios this lower asset sensitivity is primarily due to the reduction of the shortterm market rates since december which resulted in approximately billion in loans at their floors as of september when interest rates start to rise not all of these loans will immediately lift off their floors due to the lower rate environment as of september we do not run standard scenarios with negative interest rate assumptions to model the down rate scenarios that were modeled as of december webster can also hold futures options and forward foreign currency contracts to minimize the price volatility of certain assets and liabilities changes in the market value of these positions are recognized in earnings the following table summarizes the estimated impact that yield curve twists or immediate nonparallel changes in interest rates might have on nii for the subsequent twelve

of greater than eighteen months the results above reflect the annualized impact of immediate rate changes sensitivity to the short end of the yield curve for nii and ppnr decreased as of september when compared to december due to floors on loans as rates rise not all loans will immediately lift off their floors nii and ppnr were more sensitive to changes in the long end of the yield curve as of september when compared to december due to increased forecast prepayment speeds resulting from decreases in the long end of the yield curve which shortens asset duration for mbs and residential mortgages due to the lower rate environment as of september we do not run standard scenarios with negative interest rate assumptions to model the down rate scenarios that were modeled as of december the following table summarizes the estimated economic value of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet contracts at september and december and the projected change to economic values if interest rates instantaneously increase or decrease by basis points dollars in thousands book value estimated economic value estimated economic value change bp bp september assets na liabilities na net na net change as base net economic value na december assets liabilities net net change as base net economic value changes in economic value can be best described using duration duration is a measure of the price sensitivity of financial instruments for small changes in interest rates for fixedrate instruments it can also be thought of as the weightedaverage expected time to receive future cash flows for floatingrate instruments it can be thought of as the weightedaverage expected time until the next rate reset the longer the duration the greater the price sensitivity for given changes in interest rates floatingrate instruments may have durations as short as one day and therefore have very little price sensitivity due to changes in interest rates increases in interest rates typically reduce the value of fixedrate assets as future discounted cash flows are worth less at higher discount rates a liabilitys value decreases for the same reason in a rising rate environment a reduction in value of a liability is a benefit to webster duration gap is the difference between the duration of assets and the duration of liabilities a duration gap near zero implies that the balance sheet is matched and would exhibit no change in estimated economic value for a small change in interest rates websters duration gap was negative years at september and negative years at december a negative duration gap implies that liabilities are longer than assets and therefore they have more price sensitivity than assets and will reset their interest rates slower than assets consequently websters net estimated economic value would generally be expected to increase when interest rates rise as the benefit of the decreased value of liabilities would more than offset the decreased value of assets the opposite would generally be expected to occur when interest rates fall earnings would also generally be expected to increase when interest rates rise and decrease when interest rates fall over the longer term absent the effects of new business booked in the future as of september longterm rates have fallen by over basis points when compared to december this lower starting point shortens asset duration by increasing residential loan and mbs prepayment speeds these estimates assume that management does not take any additional action to mitigate any positive or negative effects from changing interest rates the earnings and economic values estimates are subject to factors that could cause actual results to differ management believes that websters interest rate risk position at september represents a reasonable level of risk given the current interest rate outlook management as always is prepared to take additional action in the event that interest rates do change rapidly for a detailed description of the companys assetliability management process refer to the section captioned assetliability management and market risk in item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in its form 10k for the year ended december impact of inflation and changing prices the condensed consolidated financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with gaap which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results principally in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation unlike most industrial companies substantially all of the assets and liabilities of a banking institution are monetary in nature as a result interest rates have a more significant impact on websters performance than the effects of general levels of inflation interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the price of goods and services use of estimates economic strategic and market assumptions are key factors in developing estimates declining economic activity and volatile market conditions related to covid19 as well as the potential impact of our strategic initiatives could impact our accounting estimates particularly those described below actual results could differ significantly from our assumptions resulting in material changes for impacted accounting estimates in future periods allowance for credit losses our credit loss allowances under the cecl model reflect our estimate of lifetime credit losses on loans and leases heldtomaturity debt securities and unfunded commitments in addition when the amortized cost of an availableforsale debt security exceeds its fair value an expected credit loss is measured using a discounted cash flow approach recognized through our credit loss allowances the recorded allowances may be insufficient if the impact of covid19 is prolonged resulting in decreases in housing activity employment levels and economic activity beyond current estimated levels refer to the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases section of managements discussion and analysis within this document for further discussion on the methodology for calculating the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases the most material of our allowances deferred tax assets as of september we had million of dtas attributable to state and local tax net operating loss nol and credit carryforwards available to offset taxable income and reduce our income taxes payable in future periods the nol and credit carryforwards are subject to expiration if they are not used within certain periods and our million valuation allowance represents the portion of the million that has been estimated to expire unused between the years and of the million of net dtas net of the million valuation allowance million is subject to expiration over the next four years including million in and million is subject to expiration between and we regularly assess all available positive and negative evidence to determine the appropriate level of our valuation allowance to help determine whether the level of our valuation allowance is appropriate we must forecast our expected future results of operations the continued economic decline and market volatility as a result of covid19 has increased the uncertainty inherent in such expectations and in the realizability of our dtas at this time we consider it morelikelythannot that we will generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize our net dtas however it is possible that some or all of our nol or credit carryforwards could expire unused if the economic decline were to be prolonged and negatively affect our current expectation that sufficient taxable income will morelikelythannot be generated in future periods over the longer term or as a result of market conditions and interestrate forecasts it is possible we could utilize more nol or credit carryforwards and realize more net dtas than has been estimated if we were to conclude that a significant portion of our net dtas is not morelikelythannot to be realized the associated valuation allowance would increase the recognition of which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations goodwill the net carrying amount of goodwill at september was million comprised of million in community banking and million in hsa bank we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually but more frequently when there are indications that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value we have assessed whether current circumstances indicate that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than carrying value as of september our assessment considered current macroeconomic conditions fiscal and monetary policy actions taken to stabilize the economy industry and market developments expected future cash flows of the reporting units forecasted growth rates performance of the companys stock and other relevant considerations based on our assessment it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeds its carrying value this assessment included assumptions that are rapidly changing and are increasingly difficult to predict due to the pandemic our next annual goodwill impairment evaluation will be performed as of november a significant decline in our expected future cash flows a continuing period of market disruption market capitalization to book value deterioration or slower growth rates could require us to record a goodwill impairment charge which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations rightofuse rou lease assets for leases where we are the lessee an rou lease asset is recorded within property plant and equipment on the consolidated balance sheet as of september rou lease assets were million and represent the present value of future minimum lease payments adjusted for the effect of uneven lease payments rou lease assets are tested for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable our rou lease assets primarily represent real estate including retail banking center locations and office space if the impact of covid19 continues to cause any of those locations to be underutilized over an extended period of time we may be required to writedown the carrying value recording an impairment of these assets may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and to a lesser effect regulatory capital ratios investments in equity securities our equity investments include tax credit finance investments small business investment companies and other strategic direct investments as of september equity investments represented million recorded within accrued interest receivable and other assets on the consolidated balance sheet equity investments are subject to various impairment standards depending on the nature of the investment if our equity investments experience significant losses or we are otherwise required to record an impairment to these investments there may be a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and to a lesser effect regulatory capital ratios application of critical accounting policies and accounting estimates the companys significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in its annual report on form 10k modifications to significant accounting policies if made during the year are described in note to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in item of this report the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap and practices generally applicable to the financial services industry requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and to disclose contingent assets and liabilities actual results could differ from those estimates management has identified the companys most critical accounting policies as allowance for credit losses on loans and leases and realizability of deferred tax assets these particular accounting policies are considered most critical in that they are important to the companys financial condition and results and they require managements subjective and complex judgment as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain accounting policies and estimates including the nature of the estimates and types of assumptions used are described throughout part ii item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in websters form 10k and item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report recently issued accounting standards updates refer to note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report for a summary of recently issued asus and the expected impact on the companys financial statements supervision and regulation the following information is intended to update and should be read in conjunction with the information contained under the caption supervision and regulation in both the companys annual report on form 10k for the year ended december and the supplemental disclosure related thereto contained its quarterly reports on form 10q filed since then cares act the cares act signed into law by the president on march provided approximately trillion in direct economic relief in response to the public health and economic impacts of covid19 many of the cares acts programs are dependent upon the direct involvement of us financial institutions like the company and webster bank these programs have been implemented through rules and guidance adopted by federal departments and agencies including the us department of treasury the federal reserve and other federal bank regulatory authorities including those with direct supervisory jurisdiction over the company and webster bank furthermore as the covid19 pandemic evolves federal regulatory authorities continue to issue additional guidance with respect to the implementation lifecycle and eligibility requirements for the various cares act programs as well as industryspecific recovery procedures for covid19 in addition it is possible that congress will enact supplementary covid19 response legislation including new bills comparable in scope to the cares act prior to the end of set forth below is a brief overview of select provisions of the cares act and other regulations and supervisory guidance related to the covid19 pandemic that are applicable to the operations and activities of the company and its subsidiaries including webster bank the following description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the cares act and the statutes regulations and policies described herein future legislation andor amendments to the provisions of the cares act or changes to any of the statutes regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the company and its subsidiaries could have a material effect on the company such legislation and related regulations and supervisory guidance will be implemented over time and will remain subject to review by congress and the implementing regulations issued by federal regulatory authorities the company continues to assess the impact of the cares act the potential impact of new covid19 legislation and other statutes regulations and supervisory guidance related to the covid19 pandemic paycheck protection program the cares act amended the sbas loan program in which webster bank participates to create a guaranteed unsecured loan program the ppp to fund operational costs of eligible businesses organizations and selfemployed persons during covid19 on june the president signed the paycheck protection program flexibility act into law which among other things gave borrowers additional time and flexibility to use ppp loan proceeds shortly thereafter and due to the evolving impact of the covid19 pandemic the president signed additional legislation authorizing the sba to resume accepting ppp applications on july and extending the ppp application deadline to august it is anticipated that additional revisions to the sbas interim final rules on forgiveness and loan review procedures will be forthcoming to address these and related changes as a participating lender in the ppp webster bank continues to monitor legislative regulatory and supervisory developments related thereto troubled debt restructuring and loan modifications for affected borrowers the cares act permits banks to suspend requirements under gaap for loan modifications to borrowers affected by covid19 that would otherwise be characterized as tdrs and suspend any determination related thereto if i the loan modification is made between march and the earlier of december or days after the end of the covid19 emergency declaration and ii the applicable loan was not more than days past due as of december federal bank regulatory authorities also issued guidance to encourage banks to make loan modifications for borrowers affected by covid19 and to assure banks that they will not be criticized by examiners for doing so the company is applying this guidance to qualifying loan modifications for additional information see note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report federal reserve programs and other recent initiatives main street lending program the cares act encouraged the federal reserve in coordination with the secretary of the treasury to establish or implement various programs to help midsize businesses nonprofits and municipalities on april the federal reserve proposed the creation of the mslp to implement certain of these recommendations on june the federal reserve bank of boston opened the mslp for lender registration the mslp supports lending to small and mediumsized businesses that were in sound financial condition before the onset of the covid19 pandemic the mslp operates through five facilities the main street new loan facility the main street priority loan facility the main street expanded loan facility the nonprofit organization new loan facility and the nonprofit organization expanded loan facility frb boston maintains the necessary legal forms and agreements for eligible borrowers and lenders to participate in these facilities and is working to refine the mslps operational infrastructure and facilities the bank has registered as a lender under the mslp and continues to monitor developments related thereto temporary regulatory capital relief related to impact of cecl concurrent with enactment of the cares act the federal bank regulatory authorities issued an interim final rule that delays the estimated impact on regulatory capital resulting from the adoption of cecl the interim final rule provides banking organizations that implement cecl before the end of the option to delay for two years the estimated impact of cecl on regulatory capital relative to regulatory capital determined under the prior incurred loss methodology followed by a threeyear transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of capital benefit provided during the initial twoyear delay on august the federal banking agencies issued a final rule confirming the relief provided under the interim final rule and expanding the pool of eligible institutions to include any institution that adopts cecl in the company has elected this capital relief and delayed the regulatory capital impact of adopting cecl during the first quarter of as a result capital ratios and amounts as of september exclude the impact of the increased allowance for credit losses on loans heldtomaturity debt securities and unfunded loan commitments attributed to the adoption of cecl adjusted for an approximation of the aftertax provision for credit losses attributable to cecl relative to the incurred loss methodology during the deferral period supervisory developments on june the federal reserve announced that it would take several actions to ensure large banks remain resilient despite the ongoing economic impact of covid19 specifically in the third quarter the federal reserve will require large banks to preserve capital by suspending share repurchases capping dividend payments and allowing dividends according to a formula based on recent income the company and webster bank continue to monitor these developments to assess what effect if any they will have but does not anticipate any material impact at this time modification of the volcker rule also on june the federal reserve along with the commodity futures trading commission fdic the office of the comptroller of the currency and the sec issued a final rule modifying the volcker rules prohibition on banking entities investing in or sponsoring hedge funds or private equity funds commonly known as covered funds the volcker rule generally prohibits banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading and from acquiring or retaining ownership interests in sponsoring or having certain relationships with a hedge fund or private equity fund the final rule modifies three areas of the volcker rule by i streamlining the covered funds portion of the rule ii addressing the extraterritorial treatment of certain foreign funds and iii permitting banking entities to offer financial services and engage in other activities that do not raise concerns that the volcker rule was intended to address the new rule became effective october the company and webster bank do not anticipate any material impact from the modified volcker rule at this time item financial statements

with us gaap the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the company have been prepared in conformity with the instructions for form 10q and rule of regulation sx accordingly they do not include all the information and notes required by gaap for complete financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the companys consolidated financial statements and related notes for the year ended december included in our form 10k filed with the sec there have been no changes to the companys significant accounting policies from those described within that form 10k except as described within the recently adopted accounting standards updates section of this note certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current years presentation these reclassifications had an immaterial effect on the companys consolidated financial statements use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates loan modifications under the cares act and interagency statement the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act section and the revised interagency statement on loan modifications and reporting for financial institutions working with customers affected by the coronavirus on march the cares act which provides relief from certain requirements under gaap was signed into law section of the cares act gives entities temporary relief from the accounting and disclosure requirements for troubled debt restructurings tdrs under asc in certain situations in addition on april certain regulatory banking agencies issued an interagency statement that offers practical expedients for evaluating whether loan modifications in response to the covid19 pandemic are tdrs the interagency statement was originally issued on march but was revised to address the relationship between their original tdr guidance and the guidance in section of the cares act to qualify for tdr accounting and disclosure relief under the cares act the applicable loan must not have been more than days past due as of december and the modification must be executed during the period beginning on march and ending on the earlier of december or the date that is days after the termination date of the national emergency declared by the president on march under the national emergencies act related to the outbreak of covid19 the cares act applies to modifications made as a result of covid19 including forbearance agreements interest rate modifications repayment plans and other arrangements to defer or delay payment of principal or interest the interagency statement does not require the modification to be completed within a certain time period if it is related to covid19 and the loan was not more than days past due as of the date of the companys implementation of its modification programs moreover the interagency statement applies to shortterm modifications including payment deferrals fee waivers extensions of repayment terms or other insignificant payment delays as a result of covid19 the company continues to apply section of the cares act and the interagency statement in connection with applicable modifications for modifications that qualify under either the cares act or the interagency statement tdr accounting and reporting is suspended through the period of the modification however the company will continue to apply its existing nonaccrual policies including consideration of the loans past due status which is determined on the basis of the contractual terms of the loan once a loan has been contractually modified the past due status is generally based on the updated terms including payment deferrals recently adopted accounting standards updates effective january the following new accounting guidance was adopted by the company asu no reference rate reform topic facilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting the update provides optional expedients and exceptions available to contracts hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform in addition to expedients for contract modifications the update allows for a onetime transfer or sale of heldtomaturity securities that reference an eligible rate the company will consider this onetime securities transfer along with other expedients available under the update as the company proceeds with reference rate reform activities for additional information on reference rate reform refer to the risk factors previously disclosed in websters annual report on form 10k for the year ended december the update became effective during the first quarter and applies to contract modifications and amendments made as of the beginning of the reporting period including the update issuance date march and applies through december the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial statements asu no codification improvements to topic financial instruments credit losses topic derivatives and hedging and topic financial instruments the update amends guidance on credit losses hedge accounting and recognition and measurement of financial instruments the changes provide clarifications and codification improvements in relation to recently issued accounting updates the amendments to the guidance on credit losses are considered in the paragraphs below related to our adoption of asu and has been adopted concurrently with those updates the company adopted the update during the first quarter on a prospective basis the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial statements asu no intangibles goodwill and other internaluse software subtopic customers accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract the update aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internaluse software the updated guidance also requires an entity to amortize the capitalized implementation costs as an expense over the term of the hosting arrangement and to present in the same income statement line item as the fees associated with the hosting arrangement the company adopted the update during the first quarter on a prospective basis to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial statements asu no fair value measurement topic disclosure framework changes to the disclosure requirements for fair value measurement the update modifies the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements the updated guidance no longer requires entities to disclose the amount and reasons for transfers between level and level of the fair value hierarchy however it requires public companies to disclose changes in unrealized gains and losses for the period included in other comprehensive income oci for recurring level fair value measurements held at the end of the reporting period and the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop level measurements the company adopted the update during the first quarter on a prospective basis the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial statements asu no intangibles goodwill and other topic simplifying the test for goodwill impairment the update simplifies quantitative goodwill impairment testing by requiring entities to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge for any amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit up to but not exceeding the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit the update changes current guidance by eliminating the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis which involves calculating the implied fair value of goodwill determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination upon acquisition entities still have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary the company adopted the update during the first quarter on a prospective basis the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial statements asu no financial instruments credit losses topic measurement of credit losses on financial instruments and subsequent asus issued to clarify this topic the updates replace the existing incurred loss approach for recognizing credit losses with a new credit loss methodology known as the current expected credit loss cecl model the cecl methodology requires earlier recognition of credit losses using a lifetime credit loss measurement approach for financial assets carried at amortized cost the updates also revised the accounting for credit losses on availableforsale debt securities which is outside the scope of the cecl methodology the cecl accounting model applies to all assets measured at amortized cost including loans net investments in leases off balance sheet credit exposures and heldtomaturity debt securities cecl requires recognition of credit losses at purchase or origination using a lifetime credit loss measurement approach the allowance for credit losses is based on the composition characteristics and credit quality of the loan and securities portfolios as of the reporting date and includes consideration of current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts at that date the cecl methodology also requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to determine the allowance for credit losses including economic forecasts allowance for credit losses on loans and leases under cecl the company determines its allowance for credit losses on loans and leases collectively using pools of assets with similar risk characteristics loans that no longer match the risk profile of the pool are individually assessed for credit losses collective assessments are performed based on two portfolio segments commercial loans and leases and consumer loans expected losses within the commercial and consumer portfolios are collectively assessed using pdlgdead framework based on the portfolio or class of financing receivable the companys lifetime credit loss models are based on historical data and incorporate forecasts of macroeconomic variables qualitative factors expected prepayments and recoveries macroeconomic variables are selected based on the correlation of the variables to credit losses for each class of financing receivable as follows the commercial model uses unemployment gross domestic product gdp and retail sales the residential model uses the case shiller home price index home equity loan and line of credit models use interest rate spreads between us treasuries and corporate bonds and the home equity loan model also uses the federal housing finance agency fhfa home price index personal loan and credit line models use the case shiller and fhfa home price indices forecasted economic scenarios are sourced from a third party data from the baseline forecast scenario is used in the modeled loss calculation qualitative factors are applied to further refine the expected loss calculation for each portfolio considering factors such as credit concentration credit quality trends the quality of internal loan reviews the nature and volume of portfolio growth staffing levels underwriting exceptions and economic considerations not reflected in the base loss model other qualitative adjustments may be applied for relevant facts and circumstances expected to impact credit losses a two year reasonable and supportable forecast period is used for all loan and lease portfolios subsequently the expected loss models revert to historical loss rates on a linear basis over a one year period historical loss rates are based on approximately years of recently available data and are updated annually when the risk characteristics of a loan no longer match the characteristics of the collective pool the loan is removed from the pool and individually assessed for credit losses generally all nonaccrual loans tdrs potential tdrs loans with a chargeoff and collateral dependent loans are individually assessed the individual assessment for credit impairment is generally based on a discounted cash flow approach unless the asset is collateral dependent a loan is considered collateral dependent when repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty collateral dependent loans are individually assessed and the expected credit loss is based on the fair value of the collateral the fair value is reduced for estimated costs to sell if the value of the collateral is expected to be realized through sale the company has elected to present accrued interest receivable separately from the amortized cost basis on the balance sheet and is not estimating an allowance for credit loss on accrued interest this election applies to loans and leases as well as debt securities the companys nonaccrual policies have not changed as a result of adopting the updates allowance for credit losses on investment securities heldtomaturity heldtomaturity debt securities follow the cecl accounting model expected losses are calculated on a pooled basis using statistical models which include forecasted scenarios of future economic conditions the forecasts revert to longrun loss rates implicitly through the economic scenario generally over three years if the risk of a heldtomaturity debt security no longer matches the collective assessment pool it is removed and individually assessed for credit deterioration a zero credit loss assumption is maintained for us treasuries and agencybacked securities in both the heldtomaturity and availableforsale portfolios the zero loss assumption is reconsidered on a quarterly basis to ensure it is still appropriate securities are placed on nonaccrual status when collection of principal and interest in accordance with contractual terms is doubtful generally when principal or interest payments become days delinquent unless the security is well secured and in process of collection or sooner if management concludes circumstances indicate that the borrower may be unable to meet contractual principal or interest payments allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments accounting for unfunded loan commitments also follows the cecl model with an allowance recorded on commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable by the company the calculation of the allowance includes the probability of funding to occur and a corresponding estimate of expected lifetime credit losses on amounts assumed to be funded the allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and the related credit expense is recorded in other noninterest expense in the consolidated statements of income accounting for availableforsale debt securities the updates revised the accounting for availableforsale debt securities by eliminating the otherthantemporary impairment model and requiring credit losses be presented as an allowance rather than a direct writedown of availableforsale debt securities under certain circumstances availableforsale debt securities continue to be recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in oci when the fair value of an availableforsale debt security falls below the amortized cost basis it is evaluated to determine if any of the decline in value is attributable to credit loss decreases in fair value attributable to credit loss are recorded directly to earnings with a corresponding allowance for credit losses limited to the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis if the credit quality subsequently improves the allowance is reversed up to a maximum of the previously recorded credit losses availableforsale debt securities follow the same nonaccrual policy as heldtomaturity debt securities when the company intends to sell an impaired availableforsale debt security or if it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the security prior to recovering the amortized cost basis the entire fair value adjustment will immediately be recognized in earnings with no corresponding allowance for credit losses impact of adoption the company adopted the updates during the first quarter using the modified retrospective method upon adoption the company recorded an increase in its allowance for credit losses as a cumulative effect adjustment this adjustment net of tax reduced the companys beginning total shareholders equity at january upon adoption the companys allowance for credit losses reflected all credit losses expected over the lifetime of the companys financial assets held at amortized cost the total increase in allowance and corresponding decrease in equity did not have a material impact to the companys regulatory capital amounts and ratios periods prior to january are reported in

definition of a variable interest entity vie consolidated rabbi trust the company established a rabbi trust to meet the obligations due under its deferred compensation plan for directors and officers and to mitigate the expense volatility of the aforementioned plan the funding of the rabbi trust and the discontinuation of the deferred compensation plan for directors and officers occurred during invested assets in the rabbi trust primarily consist of mutual funds that invest in equity and fixed income securities the company is considered the primary beneficiary of the rabbi trust as it has the power to direct the activities of the rabbi trust that significantly affect the vies economic performance and it has the obligation to absorb losses of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie the company consolidates the invested assets of the trust along with the total deferred compensation obligations and includes them in accrued interest receivable and other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities respectively on the consolidated balance sheet earnings in the rabbi trust including appreciation or depreciation are reflected as other noninterest income and changes in the corresponding liability are reflected as compensation and benefits in the consolidated income statement refer to note fair value measurements for additional information nonconsolidated tax credit finance investments the company makes nonmarketable equity investments in entities that finance affordable housing and other community development projects and provide a return primarily through the realization of tax benefits in most instances the investments require the funding of capital commitments in the future while the companys investment in an entity may exceed of its outstanding equity interests the entity is not consolidated as webster is not involved in its management for these investments the company determined it is not the primary beneficiary due to its inability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the vies the company applies the proportional amortization method to account for its investments in qualified affordable housing projects at september and december the aggregate carrying value of the companys tax creditfinance investments was million and million respectively which

balance sheet and the related interest expense is reported as interest expense on longterm debt in the consolidated income statement other nonmarketable investments the company invests in various alternative investments in which it holds a variable interest these investments are nonpublic entities which cannot be redeemed since the companys investment is distributed as the underlying equity is liquidated for these investments the company has determined it is not the primary beneficiary due to its inability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of

credit risk profile the credit risk grade system categorizes borrowers by common financial characteristics that measure the credit strength of borrowers and facilities by common structural characteristics the composite credit risk profile has ten grades with each grade corresponding to a progressively greater risk of loss grades are considered pass ratings and are considered criticized as defined by the regulatory agencies risk ratings assigned to differentiate risk within the portfolio are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revised to reflect changes in a borrowers current financial position and outlook risk profile and the related collateral and structural position loan officers review updated financial information on at least an annual basis for all pass rated loans to assess the accuracy of the risk grade criticized loans undergo more frequent reviews and enhanced monitoring a special mention credit has the potential weakness that if left uncorrected may result in

in hedge relationships interest rate swaps allow the company to change the fixed or variable nature of an interest rate without the exchange of the underlying notional amount certain pay fixedreceive variable interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges to effectively convert variablerate debt into fixedrate debt while certain receive fixedpay variable interest rate swaps are designated as fair value hedges to effectively convert fixedrate longterm debt into variablerate debt certain purchased options are designated as cash flow hedges purchased options allow the company to limit the potential adverse impact of variable interest rates by establishing a cap or a floor rate in exchange for an upfront premium the purchased options designated as cash flow hedges represent interest rate caps where payment is received from the counterparty if interest rates rise above the cap rate and interest rate floors where payment is received from the counterparty when interest rates fall below the floor rate derivatives not designated in hedge relationships the company also enters into other derivative transactions to manage economic risks but does not designate the instruments in

generally secured by the same collateral of the underlying transactions being hedged current net credit exposure relating to interest rate derivatives with webster bank customers was million at september in addition the company monitors potential future exposure representing its best estimate of exposure to remaining contractual maturity the potential future exposure relating to interest rate derivatives with webster bank customers totaled million at september the company has incorporated a credit valuation adjustment cva to reflect nonperformance risk in the fair value measurement of its derivatives the cva was million as of september various factors impact changes in the cva over time including changes in the credit spreads of the parties to the contracts as well as changes in market rates and volatilities which affect the total expected exposure of the derivative instruments note fair value measurements fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date fair value is best determined using quoted market prices however in many instances quoted market prices are not available in such instances fair values are determined using appropriate valuation techniques various assumptions and observable inputs must be relied upon in applying these techniques accordingly categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement as such the fair value estimates may not be realized in an immediate transfer of the respective asset or liability fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument these estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the entire holdings or any part of a particular financial instrument fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience current economic conditions risk characteristics of various financial instruments and other factors these factors are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates fair value hierarchy the three levels within the fair value hierarchy are as follows level valuation is based upon unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date level fair value is calculated using significant inputs other than quoted market prices that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability the valuation may rely on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as interest rates rate volatility prepayment speeds credit ratings or inputs that are derived principally or corroborated by market data by correlation or other means level inputs for determining the fair value of the respective assets or liabilities are not observable level valuations are reliant upon pricing models and techniques that require significant management judgment or estimation assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis availableforsale investment securities when quoted prices are available in an active market the company classifies availableforsale investment securities within level of the valuation hierarchy us treasury bills are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy when quoted market prices are not available the company employs an independent pricing service that utilizes matrix pricing to calculate fair value such fair value measurements consider observable data such as dealer quotes market spreads cash flows yield curves live trading levels trade execution data market consensus prepayments speeds credit information and respective terms and conditions for debt instruments management maintains procedures to monitor the pricing services results and has an established process to challenge their valuations or methodologies that appear unusual or unexpected availableforsale investment securities which include agency cmo agency mbs agency cmbs cmbs clo and corporate debt are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy derivative instruments foreign exchange contracts are valued based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and classified within level of the fair value hierarchy all other derivative instruments are valued using thirdparty valuation software which considers the present value of cash flows discounted using observable forward rate assumptions the resulting fair value is validated against valuations performed by independent third parties and are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy webster evaluates the credit risk of its counterparties to determine the cva by considering factors such as the likelihood of default by the counterparty its net exposure remaining contractual life as well as the collateral securing the position while the company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivative financial instruments fall within level of the fair value hierarchy the cva utilizes level inputs the company has assessed the significance of the impact of the cva on the overall valuation of its derivative positions as of september and has determined that the cva is not significant to the overall valuation of its derivative financial instruments therefore the company has determined that the fair value measures of its derivative financial instruments in their entirety are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy mortgage banking derivatives forward sales of mortgage loans and mortgagebacked securities are utilized by the company in its efforts to manage risk of loss associated with its mortgage loan commitments and mortgage loans held for sale prior to closing and funding certain singlefamily residential mortgage loans an interest rate lock commitment is generally extended to the borrower during the period from commitment date to closing date the company is subject to the risk that market rates of interest may change if market rates rise investors generally will pay less to purchase such loans resulting in a reduction in the gain on sale of the loans or possibly a loss in an effort to mitigate such risk forward delivery sales commitments are established under which the company agrees to deliver whole mortgage loans to various investors or issue mortgagebacked securities the fair value of mortgage banking derivatives is determined based on current market prices for similar assets in the secondary market and therefore classified within level of the fair value hierarchy originated loans held for sale residential mortgage loans typically are classified as held for sale upon origination based on managements intent to sell such loans the company generally records residential mortgage loans held for sale under the fair value option of accounting standards codification asc topic financial instruments electing to measure originated loans held for sale at fair value reduces certain timing differences and better matches changes in the value of these assets with changes in the value of the derivatives used as an economic hedge on these assets the fair value of residential mortgage loans held for sale is based on quoted market prices of similar loans sold in conjunction with securitization transactions accordingly such loans are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy the following table compares the fair value to unpaid principal balance of assets accounted for under the fair value option at september at december in thousands fair value unpaid principal balance difference fair value unpaid principal balance difference originated loans held for sale investments held in rabbi trust investments held in the rabbi trust primarily include mutual funds that invest in equity and fixed income securities shares of mutual funds are valued based on net asset value which represents quoted market prices for the underlying shares held in the mutual funds therefore investments held in the rabbi trust are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy the company has elected to measure the investments held in the rabbi trust at fair value the cost basis of the investments held in the rabbi trust is million at september alternative investments equity investments have a readily determinable fair value when quoted prices are available in an active market accordingly such alternative investments are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy equity investments that do not have a readily available fair value may qualify for net asset value nav practical expedient measurement based on specific requirements the companys alternative investments accounted for at nav consist of investments in nonpublic entities that generally cannot be redeemed since the companys investments are distributed as the underlying equity is

value on a nonrecurring basis certain assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis that is the assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances for example when there is evidence of impairment at september no significant assets classified within level were identified and measured under this basis the following is a description of valuation methodologies used for assets measured on a nonrecurring basis alternative investments the measurement alternative has been elected for alternative investments without readily determinable fair values that do not qualify for the nav practical expedient the measurement alternative requires investments to be accounted for at cost minus impairment if any plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer these alternative investments are investments in nonpublic entities that generally cannot be redeemed since the investment is distributed as the underlying equity is liquidated accordingly these alternative investments are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy the carrying amount of these alternative investments was million at september no reductions for impairments or adjustments due to observable price changes was identified during the nine months ended september transferred loans held for sale certain loans are transferred to loans held for sale once a decision has been made to sell such loans these loans are accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value and are considered to be recognized at fair value when they are recorded at below cost this activity primarily consists of commercial loans with observable inputs and is classified within level on the occasion that these loans should include adjustments for changes in loan characteristics using unobservable inputs the loans would be classified within level collateral dependent loans and leases loans and leases for which the payment is expected to be provided solely by the value of the underlying collateral are considered collateral dependent and are valued based on the estimated fair value of such collateral less estimated cost to sell using customized discounting criteria accordingly such collateral dependent loans and leases are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy other real estate owned and repossessed assets the total book value of oreo and repossessed assets was million at september oreo and repossessed assets are accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value and are considered to be recognized at fair value when recorded below cost the fair value of oreo is based on independent appraisals or internal valuation methods less estimated selling costs the valuation may consider available pricing guides auction results and price opinions certain assets require assumptions about factors that are not observable in an active market in the determination of fair value as such oreo and repossessed assets are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy in addition the amortized cost of consumer loans secured by residential real estate property that are in process of foreclosure amounted to million at september fair value of financial instruments and servicing assets the company is required to disclose the estimated fair value of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate fair value as well as servicing assets the following is a description of valuation methodologies used for those assets and liabilities cash due from banks and interestbearing deposits the carrying amount of cash due from banks and interestbearing deposits is used to approximate fair value given the short time frame to maturity and as such these assets do not present unanticipated credit concerns cash due from banks and interestbearing deposits are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy

the fair value hierarchy loans and leases net the estimated fair value of loans and leases held for investment is calculated using a discounted cash flow method using future prepayments and market interest rates inclusive of an illiquidity premium for comparable loans and leases the associated cash flows are adjusted for credit and other potential losses fair value for collateral dependent loans and leases is estimated using the net present value of the expected cash flows loans and leases are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy deposit liabilities the fair value of demand deposits savings accounts and certain money market deposits is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date deposit liabilities are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy time deposits the fair value of a fixedmaturity certificate of deposit is estimated using the rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities time deposits are classified within

within days is the carrying value fair value for all other balances are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis based on current market rates adjusted for associated credit risks as appropriate securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy federal home loan bank advances and longterm debt the fair value of fhlb advances and longterm debt is estimated using a discounted cash flow technique discount rates are matched with the time period of the expected cash flow and are adjusted as appropriate to reflect

subsequently measured under the amortization method fair value is calculated as the present value of estimated future net servicing income and relies on market based assumptions for loan prepayment speeds servicing costs discount rates and other economic factors as such the primary risk inherent in valuing mortgage servicing assets is the impact of fluctuating interest rates on the servicing revenue stream mortgage servicing assets are reviewed quarterly and held at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value fair value adjustments if any are included as a component of loan related

are organized into three reportable segments that represent its primary businesses commercial banking hsa bank and community banking these segments reflect how executive management responsibilities are assigned the type of customer served how products and services are provided and how discrete financial information is currently evaluated certain corporate treasury activities along with the amounts required to reconcile profitability metrics to amounts reported in accordance with gaap are included in the corporate and reconciling category description of segment reporting methodology webster uses an internal profitability reporting system to generate information by operating segment which is based on a series of management estimates for funds transfer pricing and allocations for noninterest expense provision for credit losses income taxes and equity capital these estimates and allocations certain of which are subjective in nature are periodically reviewed and refined changes in estimates and allocations that affect the reported results of any operating segment do not affect the consolidated financial position or results of operations of webster as a whole the full profitability measurement reports which are prepared for each operating segment reflect nongaap reporting methodologies the differences between full profitability and gaap results are reconciled in the corporate and reconciling category webster allocates interest income and interest expense to each business while any mismatch associated with the matched maturity funding concept called funds transfer pricing ftp is absorbed in corporate treasury activities the allocation process considers the specific interest rate risk and liquidity risk of financial instruments and other assets and liabilities in each line of business the matched maturity funding concept considers the origination date and the earlier of the maturity date or the repricing date of a financial instrument to assign a ftp rate for loans and deposits originated each day loans are assigned an ftp rate for funds used and deposits are assigned an ftp rate for funds provided beginning in webster refined the ftp calculation to reflect the allocation of capital credit to net interest income to better align segment results with key measurements used to review segment performance prior period net interest income and income tax expense were revised to reflect this change webster allocates a majority of noninterest expense to each reportable segment using a fullabsorption costing process costs including corporate overhead are analyzed pooled by process and assigned to the appropriate reportable segment the results of funds transfer pricing and allocations for noninterest expense as well as noninterest income produces pretax preprovision net revenue under which basis the segments are reviewed by executive management webster also allocates the provision for credit losses to each segment

transactional in nature these disaggregated amounts are reconciled to noninterest income as presented in note segment reporting contracts with customers have not generated significant contract assets and liabilities note commitments and contingencies creditrelated financial instruments the company offers creditrelated financial instruments in the normal course of business to meet certain financing needs of its customers that involve offbalance sheet risk these transactions may include an unused commitment to extend credit standby letter of credit or commercial letter of credit such transactions involve to varying degrees elements of credit risk commitments to extend credit the company makes commitments under various terms to lend funds to customers at a future point in time these commitments include revolving credit arrangements term loan commitments and shortterm borrowing agreements most of these loans have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses where a fee may be required since commitments routinely expire without being funded or after required availability of collateral occurs the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future liquidity requirements standby letter of credit a standby letter of credit commits the company to make payments on behalf of customers if certain specified future events occur the company has recourse against the customer for any amount required to be paid to a third party under a standby letter of credit which is often part of a larger credit agreement under which security is provided historically a large percentage of standby letters of credit expire without being funded the contractual amount of a standby letter of credit represents the maximum amount of potential future payments the company could be required to make and is the companys maximum credit risk commercial letter of credit a commercial letter of credit is issued to facilitate either domestic or foreign trade arrangements for customers as a general rule drafts are committed to be drawn when the goods underlying the transaction are in transit similar to a standby letter of credit a commercial letter of credit is often secured by an underlying security agreement including the assets or inventory to which they relate the following table summarizes the outstanding amounts of creditrelated financial instruments with offbalance sheet risk in thousands at september at december commitments to extend credit standby letter of credit commercial letter of credit total creditrelated financial instruments with offbalance sheet risk these commitments subject the company to potential exposure in excess of amounts recorded in the financial statements and therefore management maintains a reserve for unfunded credit commitments to provide for expected losses in connection with funding the unused portion of legal commitments to lend when those commitments are not unconditionally cancellable by webster loss calculation factors are consistent with the acl methodology for funded loans using pd and lgd applied to the underlying borrower risk and facility grades a draw down factor applied to utilization rates and relevant forecast
