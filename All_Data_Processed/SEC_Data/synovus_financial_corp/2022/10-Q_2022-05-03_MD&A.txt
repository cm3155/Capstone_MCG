transition period synovus adopted cecl on january and the march regulatory capital ratios reflect synovus election of the fiveyear transition provision at march million or a cumulative bps benefit to cet1 was deferred dividends synovus has historically paid a quarterly cash dividend to the holders of its common stock management and the board of directors closely monitor current and projected capital levels liquidity including dividends from subsidiaries financial markets and other economic trends as well as regulatory requirements regarding the payment of dividends synovus ability to pay dividends on its common stock and preferred stock is primarily dependent upon dividends and distributions that it receives from its bank and nonbanking subsidiaries which are restricted by various regulations administered by federal and state bank regulatory authorities synovus declared common stock dividends of million or per common share for the three months ended march compared to million or per common share for the three months ended march in addition synovus declared dividends on its preferred stock of million during the three months ended march and liquidity liquidity represents the extent to which synovus has readily available sources of funding to meet the needs of depositors borrowers and creditors to support asset growth and to otherwise sustain operations of synovus and its subsidiaries at a reasonable cost on a timely basis and without adverse consequences alco monitors synovus economic competitive and regulatory environment and is responsible for measuring monitoring and reporting on liquidity and funding risk as well as market risk in accordance with synovus policies and regulatory guidance alco evaluates contractual and anticipated cash flows under normal and stressed conditions to properly manage the companys liquidity profile synovus places an emphasis on maintaining numerous sources of current and contingent liquidity to meet its obligations to depositors borrowers and creditors on a timely basis liquidity is generated through various sources including but not limited to maturities and repayments of loans by clients maturities and sales of investment securities and growth in core and wholesale deposits synovus bank also generates liquidity through the issuance of brokered certificates of deposit and money market accounts synovus bank accesses these funds from a broad geographic base to diversify its sources of funding and liquidity synovus bank also has the capacity to access funding through its membership in the fhlb system and through the federal reserve discount window at march based on currently pledged collateral synovus bank had access to fhlb funding of billion subject to fhlb credit policies management continuously monitors and maintains appropriate levels of liquidity so as to provide adequate funding sources to manage client deposit withdrawals loan requests and other funding demands in addition to bank level liquidity management synovus must manage liquidity at the parent company level for various operating needs including the servicing of debt the payment of dividends on our common stock and preferred stock share repurchases payment of general corporate expense and potential capital infusions into subsidiaries the primary source of liquidity for synovus consists of dividends from synovus bank which is governed by certain rules and regulations of the ga dbf and the federal reserve bank synovus ability to receive dividends from synovus bank in future periods will depend on a number of factors including without limitation synovus banks future profits asset quality liquidity and overall condition in addition both the ga dbf and federal reserve bank may require approval to pay dividends based on certain regulatory statutes and limitations synovus presently believes that the sources of liquidity discussed above including existing liquid funds on hand are sufficient to meet its anticipated funding needs however if economic conditions were to significantly deteriorate regulatory capital requirements for synovus or synovus bank were to increase as the result of regulatory directives or otherwise or synovus believes it is prudent to enhance current liquidity levels then synovus may seek additional liquidity from external sources see part i item risk factors changes in the cost and availability of funding due to changes in the deposit market and credit market may adversely affect our capital resources liquidity and financial results of synovus form 10k furthermore synovus may from time to time take advantage of attractive market opportunities to refinance its existing debt redeem its preferred stock or strengthen its liquidity or capital position earning assets and sources of funds average total assets for the three months ended march increased billion or as compared to the first three months of average earning assets increased billion or in the first three months of compared to the same period in the increase in average earning assets primarily resulted from a billion or increase in average investment securities available for sale and a billion or increase in average total loans net of unearned which included a decrease of billion in ppp loans the increase in average loans was primarily due to growth in commercial production and line utilization these increases were partially offset by a million or decrease in average interestbearing funds held at the federal reserve bank and a million decrease in average loans held for sale average interestbearing liabilities decreased million for the first three months of compared to the same period in the decrease in average interestbearing liabilities resulted from a billion or decrease in average time deposits as a result of continued focus on remixing the deposit base a million or decrease in average brokered deposits which was driven by synovus efforts to efficiently manage its liquidity position and a million or decrease in average longterm debt which includes redemption of million in fixedtofloating rate senior bank notes in the first quarter of these decreases were mostly offset by a million or increase in average interestbearing demand deposits a million or increase in average money market deposits and a million or increase in average savings deposits average noninterestbearing deposits increased billion or for the first three months of compared to the same period in the aforementioned deposit increases were largely due to liquidity associated with various stimulus efforts and monetary policy net interest income for the three months ended march was million up million or compared to the same period in including million in ppp fees during and million in net interest margin was down bps over the comparable three month period to due primarily to the million decline in ppp fees for the three months ended march the yield on earning assets was a decrease of bps compared to the three months ended march while the effective cost of funds decreased bps to compared to the same period in the yield on loans decreased bps due primarily to the decline in ppp fees while the yield on investment securities increased bps primarily due to higher reinvestment yield and deceleration in prepayment activity compared to the prior year on a sequential quarter basis net interest income was flat with the first quarter of impacted by lower ppp fees and a lower day count excluding these impacts net interest income was up million net interest margin for the first quarter was which was up bps compared to the fourth quarter of with lower cash balances helping support the margin and offset the impact of the continued decline in ppp fees the first quarter of included million recognized for associated ppp fees versus million in the fourth quarter of and average ppp loan balances of million versus million in the fourth quarter of for the first quarter of the yield on earning assets increased bps while the effective cost of funds decreased bps compared to the fourth quarter of we continue to expect that net interest income and net interest margin will increase in the coming quarters as the benefits of higher market interest rates are realized net interest income and ratevolume analysis the following table sets forth the major components of net interest

and respectively the net interest margin is calculated by dividing annualized net interest income te by average total interest earnings assets market risk analysis interest rate risk is the primary market risk to which synovus is potentially exposed synovus measures its sensitivity to changes in market interest rates through the use of a simulation model which incorporates all of synovus earning assets and liabilities these simulations are used to determine a baseline net interest income projection and the sensitivity of the income profile based on changes in interest rates these simulations incorporate assumptions and factors including but not limited to changes in market rates in the size or composition of the balance sheet and in repricing characteristics as well as client behaviors this process is reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis in a manner consistent with synovus alco governance framework synovus has modeled its baseline net interest income forecast assuming a relatively flat interest rate environment with the federal funds rate at the federal reserves current targeted range of to and the current prime rate of synovus has modeled the impact of an immediate increase in market interest rates across the yield curve of and bps to determine the sensitivity of net interest income for the next twelve months synovus current rate risk position is considered assetsensitive and would be expected to benefit net interest income in a rising interest rate environment the following table represents the estimated sensitivity of net interest income at march with comparable information for december table twelve month net interest income sensitivity estimated change in net interest income as compared to unchanged rates for the next twelve months change in interest rates in bps march december the net interest income simulation model is the primary tool utilized to evaluate potential interest rate risks over a shorterterm time horizon synovus also evaluates potential longerterm interest rate risk through modeling and evaluation of the sensitivity of the companys eve the eve measurement process estimates the net fair value of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet financial instruments under various interest rate scenarios management uses eve sensitivity analyses as an additional means of measuring interest rate risk and incorporates this form of analysis within its governance and limits framework libor transition on march the fca confirmed that all libor settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative immediately after june for all remaining us dollar settings the arrc proposed sofr as its preferred rate as an alternative to libor and proposed a paced market transition plan to sofr from libor organizations are currently working on industrywide and companyspecific transition plans related to derivatives and cash markets exposed to libor as noted within part ii item risk factors of this report synovus holds instruments that may be impacted by the discontinuance of libor which include floating rate obligations loans deposits derivatives and hedges and other financial instruments synovus has established a crossfunctional libor transition working group with representation from all business lines support and control functions and legal counsel that has assessed the companys current exposure to libor indexed instruments and the data systems and processes that were impacted and have been changed as a result established a detailed implementation plan formulated communications and learning activities to support clients and colleagues and developed a formal governance structure for the transition for the last several years loan agreement provisions for new and renewed loans included libor fallback language to ensure transition from libor when such transition occurs all direct exposures resulting from existing financial contracts that mature after have been inventoried and are monitored on an ongoing basis the company discontinued the use of libor as of december with limited exceptions as permitted by regulatory guidance or internal policies synovus has expanded its product offerings and currently offers multiple alternative reference rates including sofr bsby and prime indices as of march the company had approximately billion in loans tied to libor that mature after june remediation activities are underway to modify or transition existing exposures to alternate index rates or to convert the rate under existing fallback language including the use of the adjustable interest libor act enacted in march and other relevant legislation critical accounting policies the accounting and financial reporting policies of synovus are in accordance with gaap and conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities synovus has identified certain of its accounting policies as critical accounting policies consisting of those related to the allowance for credit losses and income taxes in determining which accounting policies are critical in nature synovus has identified the policies that require significant judgment or involve complex estimates it is managements practice to discuss critical accounting policies with the board of directors audit committee on a periodic basis including the development selection implementation and disclosure of the critical accounting policies the application of these policies has a significant impact on synovus unaudited interim consolidated financial statements synovus financial results could differ significantly if different judgments or estimates are used in the application of these policies all accounting policies described in part ii item financial statements and supplementary data note summary of significant accounting policies in synovus form 10k should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance there have been no significant changes to the accounting policies estimates and assumptions or the judgments affecting the application of these estimates and assumptions from those disclosed in synovus form 10k nongaap financial measures the measures entitled adjusted noninterest revenue adjusted noninterest expense adjusted total revenue adjusted tangible efficiency ratio adjusted net income per common share diluted adjusted return on average assets adjusted return on average common equity adjusted return on average tangible common equity and tangible common equity ratio are not measures recognized under gaap and therefore are considered nongaap financial measures the most comparable gaap measures to these measures are total noninterest revenue total noninterest expense total te revenue efficiency ratiote net income per common share diluted return on average assets return on average common equity and the ratio of total shareholders equity to total assets respectively management believes that these nongaap financial measures provide meaningful additional information about synovus to assist management and investors in evaluating synovus operating results financial strength the performance of its business and the strength of its capital position however these nongaap financial measures have inherent limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of operating results or capital position as reported under gaap the nongaap financial measures should be considered as additional views of the way our financial measures are affected by significant items and other factors and since they are not required to be uniformly applied they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures at other companies adjusted total revenue and adjusted noninterest revenue are measures used by management to evaluate total te revenue and noninterest revenue exclusive of net investment securities gains losses and fair value adjustment on nonqualified deferred compensation adjusted noninterest expense and the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio are measures utilized by management to measure the success of expense management initiatives focused on reducing recurring controllable operating costs adjusted net income per common share diluted adjusted return on average assets and adjusted return on average common equity are measurements used by management to evaluate operating results exclusive of items that management believes are not indicative of ongoing operations and impact periodtoperiod comparisons adjusted return on average tangible common equity is a measure used by management to compare synovus performance with other financial institutions because it calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization thereby allowing management to evaluate the performance of the business consistently the tangible common equity ratio is used by management to assess the strength of our capital position the computations of these measures are set forth in the tables below table reconciliation of nongaap financial measures three
