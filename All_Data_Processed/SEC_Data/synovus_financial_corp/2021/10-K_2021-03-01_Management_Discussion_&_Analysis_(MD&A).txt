in financial condition and results of operations as well as a summary of synovus critical accounting policies this section should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in part ii item financial statements and supplementary data of this report economic environment and recent events the us economy contracted in the first half of ending the longest expansionary period in us history due to the covid19 pandemic during march in an effort to lessen the impact of covid19 on consumers and businesses the federal reserve reduced the federal funds rate percentage points to to percent and the us government enacted the cares act the largest economic stimulus package in the nations history the us economy began to recover somewhat during the third quarter of on december the us government amended the cares act through the consolidated appropriations act of to add additional stimulus relief to mitigate the continued impacts of the pandemic while certain financial and economic metrics suggest improving economic conditions uncertainty remains regarding the trajectory of the economic recovery the impact of government stimulus the success of the covid19 vaccine as well as the effects of the change in presidential and congressional administrations synovus responded to the pandemic beginning in march supporting our customers team members and communities with such measures as remote work capabilities and branch service enhancements covid19 related bonus payments and benefits for team members directly impacted by the virus payment deferments on approximately billion of our loan portfolio during the second quarter and accelerated investments in several technology initiatives that provided more convenience and a better digital experience as customers adapted to this highly virtual environment synovus is participating in the ppp and funded close to loans totaling nearly billion during the second quarter synovus is also participating in the newest round of ppp with over loan applications submitted totaling billion in new requests as of february additionally although the vast majority of our customers were no longer in a deferment program at the end of the year we continued to work with our borrowers who have been impacted b y the pandemic largely concentrated in hospitality related segments including hotels and fullservice restaurants in our communities we responded with financial contributions to more than a dozen organizations for pandemic relief efforts matching contributions for covid19 donations to the american red cross and meal donations for first responders and health care workers we announced synovus forward in january a plan to add million pretax benefit by the end of through a combination of revenue and expense initiatives our expense initiatives included reductions in thirdparty spend of million branch rationalization with branches consolidated during with million in savings and organizational staffing efficiencies with a voluntary early retirement program and backoffice staffing optimization with million in benefit in our revenue initiatives included marketbased repricing of our treasury and payment solutions offerings with an anticipated benefit of million in the first half of aggressive repricing of deposits a commercial analytics program and significant improvements in our digital capabilities in january we announced an expected additional million benefit to be achieved by yearend with benefits from both revenue and expense initiatives with a heavier weight toward revenues in december an executive transition plan was announced and kevin blair was named to synovus board of directors effective immediately in april chairman and ceo kessel stelling will transition into the role of executive chairman and mr blair will succeed mr stelling as ceo overview of financial results net income available to common shareholders for was million a decrease of compared to million for net income per diluted common share was in and in adjusted net income available to common shareholders for was million or per diluted common share a decrease of and respectively compared to million or per diluted common share for the yearoveryear decline in adjusted net income per common share was impacted by deterioration in the economic environment caused by the covid19 pandemic and driven by a significant increase in provision for credit losses following the adoption of cecl on january significant decline in the federal funds rate and paa including loan discount accretion and deposit premium amortization that positively impacted net interest income for was billion down million or from billion in due to declines of million in paa primarily comprised of declines of million of deposit premium amortization and million of loan accretion associated with the fcb acquisition and declines in market interest rates which were somewhat offset by higher average earning assets including the impact of ppp with recognition of million in processing fees the net interest margin was for a decrease of basis points from in due primarily to the decline in market interest rates in ad dition to basis points from declines in paa excluding the impact from ppp we expect modest downward pressure in the net interest margin in the first quarter of as further reductions in cost of funds are more than offset by continued fixedrate asset repricing noninterest revenue for the year ended december was million up million or compared to the year ended december adjusted noninterest revenue which excludes net investment securities gains losses and gain on sale and net changes in fair value of private equity investments was million up million or compared to due primarily to strong growth in mortgage banking income with record production driven by the interest rate environment we expect more normalized secondary mortgage banking revenue in noninterest expense for the year ended december was billion an increase of million or compared to the year ended december during synovus recognized a million noncash goodwill impairment charge representing the goodwill allocated to the consumer mortgage reporting unit adjusted noninterest expense which excludes goodwill impairment restructuring charges loss on early extinguishment of debt earnout liability adjustments mergerrelated expense and certain other items for increased million or compared to the increase in adjusted expense was largely driven by mortgage production commissions expense associated with synovus internal revenue growth and efficiency initiatives ppp and covid19 related expenses and investments in talent and technology the efficiency ratiofte for was compared to in and the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio was compared to in at december total loans net of deferred fees and costs of billion increased billion or from december due to net ci growth of billion primarily in ppp loans and net cre growth of million partially offset by a billion net decline in consumer loans the decline in consumer loans is primarily the result of the strategic disposition of billion in thirdparty singleservice consumer and nonrelationship consumer mortgage loans the acl at december totaled million an increase of million compared to december reflecting the building of the acl required under cecl primarily as a result of uncertainty and deterioration in the economic environment due to covid19 the acl to loans coverage ratio was or excluding ppp loans at december current credit metrics remained relatively stable with npa and npl ratios of and respectively and total past dues of net chargeoffs for were basis points compared to basis points for we expect the net chargeoff ratio in the first quarter of to be near the range we experienced in the last half of total periodend deposits were billion at december up significantly by billion or compared to yearend due largely to client preferences for maintaining liquidity during as well as government stimulus programs which further supported deposit growth partially offset by strategic declines in time deposits we expect the elevated cash position to decline in coming quarters due to seasonal deposit outflows and as we manage our balance sheet and overall liquidity position which will include further growth in our securities portfolio and continued declines in brokered deposits our cet1 ratio of at december was above our stated operating range of which we believe is prudent while greater levels of uncertainty exist our outlook maintains the current common shareholder dividend of per quarter and includes authorization for share repurchases of up to million we will be opportunistic with repurchase activity throughout the year as we prioritize organic growth first and balance capital deployment with factors such as uncertainty in the economic outlook more detail on synovus financial

substandard accruing loans included in criticized and classified loans but exclude both loans days past due and still accruing interest and substandard accruing tdrs which are reported separately

equity adjusted return on average tangible common equity and tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio are not measures recognized under gaap and therefore are considered nongaap financial measures the most comparable gaap measures to these measures are total noninterest revenue total noninterest expense total revenues efficiency ratiofte return on average assets net income available to common shareholders net income per common share diluted return on average common equity and the ratio of total shareholders equity to total assets respectively management believes that these nongaap financial measures provide meaningful additional information about synovus to assist management and investors in evaluating synovus operating results financial strength the performance of its business and the strength of its capital position however these nongaap financial measures have inherent limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of operating results or capital position as reported under gaap the nongaap financial measures should be considered as additional views of the way our financial measures are affected by significant items and other factors and since they are not required to be uniformly applied they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures at other companies adjusted noninterest revenue and adjusted total revenues are measures used by management to evaluate noninterest revenue and total revenues exclusive of net investment securities gains losses as well as gain on sale and changes in fair value of private equity investments net adjusted noninterest expense and the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio are measures utilized by management to measure the success of expense management initiatives focused on reducing recurring controllable operating costs adjusted return on average assets adjusted net income available to common shareholders adjusted net income per common share diluted and adjusted return on average common equity are measurements used by management to evaluate operating results exclusive of items that management believes are not indicative of ongoing operations and impact periodtoperiod comparisons the return on average tangible common equity and adjusted return on average tangible common equity are measures used by management to compare synovus performance with other financial institutions because it calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization thereby allowing management to evaluate the performance of the business consistently the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio is used by management to assess the strength of our capital position the
