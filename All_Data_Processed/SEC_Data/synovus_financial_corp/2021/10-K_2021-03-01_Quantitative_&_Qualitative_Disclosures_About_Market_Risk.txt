item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk and interest rate sensitivity market risk reflects the risk of economic loss resulting from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates this risk of loss can be reflected in either diminished market values within the balance sheet or reduced current and potential net income synovus most significant market risk is interest rate risk this risk arises primarily from synovus core banking activities of extending loans and accepting deposits managing interest rate risk is a primary goal of the asset liability management function synovus attempts to achieve consistency in net interest income while limiting volatility arising from changes in interest rates synovus seeks to accomplish this goal by balancing the maturity and repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities along with the selective use of derivative instruments the company manages this exposure in accordance with policies that are established by alco and approved by the risk committee of the board of directors alco meets periodically and has responsibility for developing asset liability management policies reviewing the interest rate sensitivity of synovus and developing and implementing strategies to improve balance sheet structure and interest rate risk positioning synovus measures the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates through the use of simulation modeling this effort involves assessing the companys forecasted net interest income profile under various scenarios and over varying time horizons the results of these simulations aid in measuring the companys exposures and relative sensitivities namely to changes in interest rates the scenarios generally include numerous assumptions including those related to changes in the balance sheet interest rates prepayment trends and the repricing characteristics of noncontractual deposits such assumptions may change through time as a result of a host of factors including changes in the balance sheet as well as the interest rate environment the simulation modeling process is performed in a manner consistent with synovus policies and procedures with results reviewed on an ongoing basis by alco and the risk committee of the board of directors with this framework synovus has modeled its baseline net interest income forecast assuming a relatively flat interest rate environment with the federal funds rate at the federal reserves current targeted range of to and the current prime rate of synovus has modeled the impact of a gradual increase in market interest rates across the yield curve of and basis points and a gradual decline of basis points to determine the sensitivity of net interest income for the next twelve months as illustrated in the table below the net interest income sensitivity derived from this simulation suggests that net interest income is projected to increase by and if interest rates increased by and basis points respectively net interest income is projected to decline by if interest rates decreased by basis points these results indicate that the company has an asset sensitive position over the next year which could serve to improve net interest income in a rising interest rate environment or reduce net interest income in a declining rate environment table start table twelve month net interest income sensitivity change in interest rates in basis points estimated change in net interest income as of december flat na table end while all of the above estimates are reflective of the general interest rate sensitivity of synovus local market conditions the realized growth and remixing of the balance sheet as well as the broader macroeconomic environment could all have a significant impact on the both the sensitivity and realized level of net interest income in addition to assessing net interest income sensitivities we also perform simulation analyses to assess the sensitivity of our economic value of equity eve relative to changes in market interest rates eve is measured as the discounted present value of assets and derivative cash flows minus the discounted present value of liability cash flows management uses eve sensitivity as an additional means of measuring interest rate risk and incorporates this form of analysis within its governance and limits framework synovus is also subject to market risk in certain of its fee income business lines financial management services revenues which include trust brokerage and asset management fees can be affected by risk in the securities markets primarily the equity securities market a significant portion of the fees in this unit are determined based upon a percentage of asset values weaker securities markets and lower equity values have an adverse impact on the fees generated by these operations trading account assets maintained to facilitate brokerage customer activity are also subject to market risk this risk is not considered significant as trading activities are limited and subject to risk policy limits mortgage banking income is also subject to market risk mortgage loan originations are sensitive to levels of mortgage interest rates and therefore mortgage banking income could be negatively impacted during a period of rising interest rates the extension of commitments to customers to fund mortgage loans also subjects synovus to market risk this risk is primarily created by the time period between making the commitment and closing and delivering the loan synovus seeks to minimize this exposure by utilizing various risk management tools the primary of which are forward sales commitments and best efforts commitments derivative instruments for interest rate risk management synovus utilizes derivative instruments to manage its exposure to various types of structural interest rate risks by executing enduser derivative transactions designated as hedges hedging relationships may be designated as either a cash flow hedge which mitigates risk exposure to the variability of future cash flows or other forecasted transactions or a fair value hedge which mitigates risk exposure to adverse changes in the fair market value of a fixed rate asset or liability due to changes in market interest rates as of december and the company had entered into billion and billion respectively notional of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedging instruments to hedge its exposure to contractually specified interest rate risk associated with floating rate loans libor transition in july the financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor at the end of on november a joint announcement by the board of governors of the federal reserve the fdic and the occ was released and included a statement that the administrator of libor has announced it will consult on its intention to cease the publication of the one week and two month usd libor settings immediately following the libor publication on december and the remaining usd libor settings immediately following the libor publications on june the arrc has proposed the sofr as its preferred rate as an alternative to libor and has proposed a paced market transition plan to sofr from libor organizations are currently working on industrywide and companyspecific transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to libor as noted within our risk factors of this report synovus holds instruments that may be impacted by the discontinuance of libor including floating rate obligations loans deposits derivatives and hedges and other financial instruments but is not able to currently predict the associated financial impacts of the transition to an alternative reference rate synovus has established a crossfunctional libor transition working group that has assessed the companys current exposure to libor indexed instruments and the data systems and processes that will be impacted established a detailed implementation plan and developed a formal governance structure for the transition
