tdr designation have continued to remain at low levels nontdr modifications due to covid19 regulatory agencies have encouraged financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers who are or may be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations because of covid19 in the interagency statement on loan modifications and reporting for financial institutions working with customers affected by the coronavirus initially issued on march and revised on april for example the regulatory agencies expressed their view of loan modification programs as positive actions that may mitigate adverse effects on borrowers due to covid19 and their unwillingness to criticize institutions for working with borrowers in a safe and sound manner moreover the interagency statement provided that eligible loan modifications related to covid19 may be accounted for under section of the cares act or in accordance with asc on december the consolidated appropriations act extended the applicable period of section of the cares act this allows banks to elect to not consider loan modifications related to covid19 that are made between march and the earlier of january or days after the national emergency ends to borrowers that are current ie less than days past due as of december as tdrs the regulatory agencies further stated that performing loans granted payment deferrals due to covid19 are not considered past due or nonaccrual fasb confirmed the foregoing regulatory agencies view that such shortterm modifications eg six months made on a goodfaith basis in response to covid19 for borrowers who are current are not tdrs during synovus provided relief programs consisting primarily of 90day payment deferral relief to borrowers negatively impacted by covid19 and as of september no loans were

table reconciliation of nongaap financial measures in this report for the applicable reconciliation to the most comparable gaap measure at september synovus cet1 ratio was well in excess of regulatory requirements including the capital conservation buffer of the september cet1 ratio declined bps compared to december driven by growth in riskweighted assets and return of capital through share repurchases and common stock shareholder dividends which was a result of strong financial performance for additional information on regulatory capital requirements see part ii item financial statements and supplementary data note regulatory capital to the consolidated financial statements of synovus form 10k management reviews the companys capital position on an ongoing basis and believes based on internal capital analyses and earnings projections that synovus is well positioned to meet relevant regulatory capital standards synovus announced on january that its board of directors authorized share repurchases of up to million in during the nine months ended september synovus repurchased a total of million or million shares of its common stock at an average price of per share as of october the remaining authorization under this program was million based on current conditions and economic outlook we expect to complete the full authorization in the fourth quarter of on august the federal banking regulators issued a final rule following an interim final rule issued on march that allowed electing banking organizations that adopt cecl during to mitigate the estimated effects of cecl on regulatory capital for two years followed by a threeyear phasein transition period synovus adopted cecl on january and the september regulatory capital ratios reflect synovus election of the fiveyear transition provision at september million or a cumulative bps benefit to cet1 was deferred dividends synovus has historically paid a quarterly cash dividend to the holders of its common stock management and the board of directors closely monitor current and projected capital levels liquidity including dividends from subsidiaries financial markets and other economic trends as well as regulatory requirements regarding the payment of dividends synovus ability to pay dividends on its common stock and preferred stock is primarily dependent upon dividends and distributions that it receives from its bank and nonbanking subsidiaries which are restricted by various regulations administered by federal and state bank regulatory authorities synovus declared common stock dividends of million or per common share during the nine months ended september and in addition synovus declared dividends on its preferred stock of million during the nine months ended september and liquidity liquidity represents the extent to which synovus has readily available sources of funding to meet the needs of depositors borrowers and creditors to support asset growth and to otherwise sustain operations of synovus and its subsidiaries at a reasonable cost on a timely basis and without adverse consequences alco monitors synovus economic competitive and regulatory environment and is responsible for measuring monitoring and reporting on liquidity and funding risk as well as market risk in accordance with synovus policies and regulatory guidance alco evaluates contractual and anticipated cash flows under normal and stressed conditions to properly manage the companys liquidity profile synovus places an emphasis on maintaining numerous sources of current and contingent liquidity to meet its obligations to depositors borrowers and creditors on a timely basis liquidity is generated through various sources including but not limited to maturities and repayments of loans by clients maturities and sales of investment securities and growth in core or wholesale deposits management continuously monitors and maintains appropriate levels of liquidity so as to provide adequate funding sources to manage client deposit withdrawals loan requests and other funding demands synovus bank also generates liquidity through the issuance of brokered certificates of deposit and money market accounts synovus bank accesses these funds from a broad geographic base to diversify its sources of funding and liquidity synovus bank also has the capacity to access funding through its membership in the fhlb system and through the federal reserve discount window at september based on currently pledged collateral synovus bank had access to incremental fhlb funding of billion subject to fhlb credit policies in addition to bank level liquidity management synovus must manage liquidity at the parent company level for various operating needs including the servicing of debt the payment of dividends on our common stock and preferred stock share repurchases payment of general corporate expenses and potential capital infusions into subsidiaries the primary source of liquidity for synovus consists of dividends from synovus bank which is governed by certain rules and regulations of the ga dbf and the federal reserve bank synovus ability to receive dividends from synovus bank in future periods will depend on a number of factors including but not limited to synovus banks future profits asset quality liquidity and overall condition in addition both the ga dbf and federal reserve bank may require approval to pay dividends based on certain regulatory statutes and limitations synovus presently believes that the sources of liquidity discussed above including existing liquid funds on hand are sufficient to meet its anticipated funding needs however if economic conditions were to significantly deteriorate regulatory capital requirements for synovus or synovus bank were to increase as the result of regulatory directives or otherwise or synovus believes it is prudent to enhance current liquidity levels then synovus may seek additional liquidity from external sources see part i item risk factors changes in the cost and availability of funding due to changes in the deposit market and credit market may adversely affect our capital resources liquidity and financial results of synovus form 10k furthermore synovus may from time to time take advantage of attractive market opportunities to refinance its existing debt redeem its preferred stock or strengthen its liquidity or capital position earning assets and sources of funds average total assets for the nine months ended september increased billion or to billion as compared to billion for the first nine months of average earning assets increased billion or in the first nine months of compared to the same period in the increase in average earning assets primarily resulted from a billion or

other shortterm borrowings these decreases were mostly offset by a billion or increase in average money market deposits and a billion or increase in average interestbearing demand deposits average noninterestbearing deposits increased billion or to billion for the first nine months of compared to the same period in due largely to liquidity associated with various government stimulus efforts net interest income for the nine months ended september was billion up million compared to the same period in including million in ppp fees during and million in net interest margin was down bps over the comparable nine month period to due primarily to the decline in market interest rates and average growth in investment securities available for sale and interestbearing funds held at the federal reserve bank for the nine months ended september the yield on earning assets was a decrease of bps compared to the nine months ended september while the effective cost of funds decreased bps to the yield on loans decreased bps to due primarily to the decline in market interest rates while the yield on investment securities decreased bps to due primarily to an acceleration in prepayments and increase in premium amortization compared to the nine months ended september on a sequential quarter basis net interest income was up million or primarily due to continued asset growth further declines in deposit costs and a higher day count net interest margin for the third quarter was stable at which was down bp compared to the second quarter of with continued pressure from the liquidity

quarter of for the third quarter of the yield on earning assets decreased bps while the effective cost of funds decreased bps compared to the second quarter of we continue to expect that net interest income excluding ppp fees will increase in the remainder of the year driven by loan growth and deployment of liquidity which are expected to offset headwinds from continued fixedrate repricing and the

ended september and respectively the net interest margin is calculated by dividing annualized net interest income te by average total interest earnings assets market risk analysis interest rate risk is the primary market risk to which synovus is potentially exposed synovus measures its sensitivity to changes in market interest rates through the use of a simulation model which incorporates all of synovus earning assets and liabilities these simulations are used to determine a baseline net interest income projection and the sensitivity of the income profile based on changes in interest rates these simulations incorporate assumptions and factors including but not limited to changes in market rates in the size or composition of the balance sheet and in repricing characteristics as well as client behaviors this process is reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis in a manner consistent with synovus alco governance framework synovus has modeled its baseline net interest income projection assuming a flat interest rate environment with the federal funds rate at the federal reserves current targeted range of to and the current prime rate of synovus has modeled the impact of a gradual increase in market interest rates across the yield curve of and bps and a gradual decline of bps to determine the sensitivity of net interest income for the next twelve months the lesser decline of the downrate scenario presented was selected in light of the low absolute level of monetary policy rates and generally incorporates an assumption that rates are floored at the zerolowerbound synovus current rate risk position is considered assetsensitive and would be expected to benefit net interest income in a rising interest rate environment and reduce net interest income in a declining interest rate environment a modest decline in sensitivity relative to the prior periodend is the result of a host of factors including increased securities portfolio and the higher absolute level of longterm interest rates the following table represents the estimated sensitivity of net interest income at september with comparable information for december table twelve month net interest income sensitivity estimated change in net interest income as compared to unchanged rates for the next twelve months change in shortterm interest rates in bps september december the net interest income simulation model is the primary tool utilized to evaluate potential interest rate risks over a shorterterm time horizon synovus also evaluates potential longerterm interest rate risk through modeling and evaluation of the sensitivity of the companys eve the eve measurement process estimates the net fair value of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet financial instruments under various interest rate scenarios management uses eve sensitivity analyses as an additional means of measuring interest rate risk and incorporates this form of analysis within its governance and limits framework libor transition in july the fca which regulates libor announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor at the end of on march the fca confirmed that all libor settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative immediately after december for the 1week and 2month us dollar settings and immediately after june for all remaining us dollar settings the arrc has proposed sofr as its preferred rate as an alternative to libor and has proposed a paced market transition plan to sofr from libor organizations are currently working on industrywide and companyspecific transition plans related to derivatives and cash markets exposed to libor as noted within part i item risk factors of synovus form 10k synovus holds instruments that may be impacted by the discontinuance of libor which include floating rate obligations loans deposits derivatives and hedges and other financial instruments synovus has established a crossfunctional libor transition working group with representation from all business lines support and control functions and legal counsel that has assessed the companys current exposure to libor indexed instruments and the data systems and processes that will be impacted established a detailed implementation plan formulated communications and learning activities to support clients and colleagues and developed a formal governance structure for the transition loan agreement provisions for new and renewed loans include libor fallback language to ensure transition from libor to the new benchmark when such transition occurs all direct exposures resulting from existing financial contracts that mature after have been inventoried and are monitored on an ongoing basis based on regulatory guidance the company currently expects to cease originating loans indexed to libor no later than december synovus has expanded its product offerings and currently offers multiple alternative reference rates including sofr and bsby indices other viable alternative reference rates are also being evaluated for use as potential replacements of libor we do not currently expect there to be a material financial impact to the company or our clients regardless of which index or indices the company offers as alternatives to libor critical accounting policies the accounting and financial reporting policies of synovus are in accordance with gaap and conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities synovus has identified certain of its accounting policies as critical accounting policies consisting of those related to the allowance for credit losses and income taxes in determining which accounting policies are critical in nature synovus has identified the policies that require significant judgment or involve complex estimates it is managements practice to discuss critical accounting policies with the board of directors audit committee on a periodic basis including the development selection implementation and disclosure of the critical accounting policies the application of these policies has a significant impact on synovus unaudited interim consolidated financial statements synovus financial results could differ significantly if different judgments or estimates are used in the application of these policies all accounting policies described in part ii item financial statements and supplementary data note summary of significant accounting policies in synovus form 10k should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance there have been no significant changes to the accounting policies estimates and assumptions or the judgments affecting the application of these estimates and assumptions from those disclosed in synovus form 10k other than the exclusion of goodwill impairment as a critical accounting estimate due to lack of impairment

common share diluted adjusted return on average assets adjusted return on average common equity adjusted return on average tangible common equity and tangible common equity ratio are not measures

revenue efficiency ratiote net income per common share diluted return on average assets return on average common equity and the ratio of total shareholders equity to total assets respectively management believes that these nongaap financial measures provide meaningful additional information about synovus to assist management and investors in evaluating synovus operating results financial strength the performance of its business and the strength of its capital position however these nongaap financial measures have inherent limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of operating results or capital position as reported under gaap the nongaap financial measures should be considered as additional views of the way our financial measures are affected by significant items and other factors and since they are not required to be uniformly applied they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures at other companies adjusted total revenue and adjusted noninterest revenue are measures used by management to evaluate total te revenue and noninterest revenue exclusive of net investment securities gains losses changes in fair value of private equity investments net and fair value adjustment on nonqualified deferred compensation adjusted noninterest expense and the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio are measures utilized by management to measure the success of expense management initiatives focused on reducing recurring controllable operating costs adjusted net income per common share diluted adjusted return on average assets and adjusted return on average common equity are measurements used by management to evaluate operating results exclusive of items that management believes are not indicative of ongoing operations and impact periodtoperiod comparisons adjusted return on average tangible common equity is a measure used by management to compare synovus performance with other financial institutions because it calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization thereby allowing management to evaluate the performance of the business consistently the tangible common equity ratio is used by management to assess the strength of our capital position the computations of these measures are set forth in
