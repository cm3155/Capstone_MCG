disruption in synovus markets in march the outbreak of covid19 caused by a novel strain of the coronavirus was recognized as a pandemic by the world health organization shortly thereafter the president of the us declared a national emergency throughout the us attributable to such outbreak the outbreak has become increasingly widespread in the us including in the markets in which synovus operates though the magnitude of the impact remains to be seen synovus has taken a number of steps to assess the effects of the outbreak and mitigate the adverse consequences to its businesses nonetheless synovuss business will likely be adversely impacted by the outbreak of covid19 as previously disclosed in part i item ia risk factors of synovus form 10k synovus operations and profitability are impacted by business and economic conditions generally as well as those in the primary banking markets in which it operates the covid19 pandemic has resulted in historic job losses and decreases in economic activity while the duration and full extent of job losses and magnitude of economic dislocation are not yet known it is clear that they may impact the ability of individuals and businesses to make payments adversely affect the value of underlying collateral and the ability of guarantors to make payments in the case of default which may decrease demand for synovus products and services and otherwise adversely impact synovus financial condition results of operations and business while the us and various state and local governments have implemented various programs designed to aid individuals and businesses the impact of and extent to which these efforts will be successful cannot be determined at this time specifically many of synovus customers and counterparties have been and may continue to be adversely impacted by the covid19 pandemic and resulting economic downturn as a result synovus has faced and may continue to face a decrease in demand for certain products reduced access to its branches by its customers and disruptions in the operations of its vendors and third party partners the pandemic could also result in recognition of additional credit losses in synovus loan portfolios and increase its allowance for credit losses as both businesses and consumers are negatively impacted by the economic downturn in addition in future periods synovus will be required to evaluate the impact of covid19 on the carrying value of certain of its assets including goodwill and to conduct impairments tests on those assets which may result in impairment charges on these assets in future periods that could be material synovus may also be required to take valuation allowances with respect to its deferred tax assets in future periods in the event it suffers losses or has reduced income or is unable to rely on future forecasts due to the uncertainty resulting from covid19 any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on synovus financial condition results of operations and business the extent to which the pandemic impacts synovus results will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including the duration of the pandemic government and regulatory responses to the pandemic new information which may emerge concerning its severity and the actions necessary to contain it or address its impact among others behavioral changes are not fully known and may not be temporary the covid19 pandemic has resulted in significant market volatility and lower interest rates that could materially affect synovus results of operations and access to capital the covid19 pandemic has also caused signi ficant recent volatility in financial markets and adverse economic conditions and may have significant longterm adverse effects on the us economy including increased instability in capital markets declines in business and consumer confidence reduction in economic activity increased unemployment and recession this may result in decreased capital and liquidity if the economic situation deteriorates federal and state regulators may also consider taking actions such as suspension of dividends share repurchases and other capital distributions in order to conserve capital and retain capacity any of which could adversely impact synovus business further sustained adverse effects from the covid19 pandemic may also prevent us from satisfying our regulatory and other supervisory requirements or result in downgrades in our credit ratings making it more difficult to access the capital markets additionally the economic disruption caused by covid19 has resulted in a number of federal reserve actions resulting in market interest rates declining significantly on march the 10year treasury yield fell below for the first time and the federal reserve reduced the target federal funds rate by bps to to on march the federal reserve further reduced the target federal funds rate by bps to to and announced a billion quantitative easing program in response to the expected economic downturn caused by the covid19 pandemic the federal reserve reduced the interest that it pays on excess reserves from to on march and then to on march we expect that these reductions in interest rates especially if prolonged could adversely affect synovus net interest income net interest margins and profitability furthermore such low rates increase the risk of a negative interest rate environment in which interest rates drop below zero either broadly or for some types of instruments such an occurrence would likely further reduce the interest synovus earns on loans and other earning assets while also likely requiring synovus to pay to maintain its deposits with the federal reserve bank synovus systems may not be able to handle adequately a negative interest rate environment and not all variable rate instruments are designed for such a circumstance synovus cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary policies in response to covid19 or the precise effects that they may have on synovus activities and financial results t he covid19 pandemic has impacted and will likely continue to impact synovus operations as a result of the covid19 pandemic synovus has taken significant precautions to ensure the health and safety of its team members and customers which include operating over of its branches as drivethru and appointment only branches and having over of its team member working remotely these precautions could impact demand for synovus products and services the increased reliance on remote access to information systems increases synovus exposure to potential cybersecurity breaches and could impact synovus productivity additionally synovus business customers are increasingly required to work remotely as well and may not have appropriately secured remote networks may be more vulnerable to cyberattacks or phishing schemes that could also affect us furthermore if a large proportion of synovus key employees were to contract covid19 or be quarantined as a result of the virus synovus operations could be adversely impacted and its business continuity plans may not prove effective federal state and local governments have mandated or encouraged financial services companies to make accommodations to borrowers and other customers affected by the covid19 pandemic legal and regulatory responses to concerns about the covid19 pandemic could result in additional regulation or restrictions affecting the conduct of our business in the future in addition to the potential affects from negative economic conditions noted above synovus instituted a program to help covid19 impacted customers this program includes waiving nsf and monthly service charges and offering payment deferment and other loan relief as appropriate for customers impacted by covid19 synovus liquidity could be negatively impacted if a significant number of customers apply and are approved for the deferral of payments in addition if these deferrals are not effective in mitigating the effect of covid19 on synovus customers it may adversely affect its business and results of operations more substantially over a longer period of time in addition a significant amount of the loan growth synovus experienced in april has been a direct result of ppp loans this loan growth is likely to end in the neartern furthermore there has been meaningful litigation against banks such as synovus related to their participation in the ppp and other government stimulus programs the costs and effects of such litigation could be material to synovus
