item risk factors this section highlights the material risks that we currently face please be aware that these risks may change over time and other risks may prove to be important in the future new risks may emerge at any time and we cannot predict such risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our business financial condition or results of operations or the trading price of our securities strategic risk competition in the financial services industry may adversely affect our future earnings and growth we operate in a highly competitive environment and our profitability and our future growth depends on our ability to compete successfully we face pricing competition for loans and deposits and in order for us to compete for borrowers and depositors we may be required to offer loans and deposits on terms less favorable to us including lower rates on our loans and higher rates on our deposits we also compete for customers based on such factors as convenience product lines technology accessibility of service and service capabilities certain of our competitors are larger and have more resources than we do enabling them to be more aggressive than us in competing for loans and deposits and investing in new products technology and services in addition the ability of nonbank competitors to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has intensified the competition we face these nonbank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern us and therefore may be able to operate with greater flexibility and lower cost structures nonbank competitors can also operate in areas or offer certain products that are considered speculative or risky such as cryptocurrencies that may be attractive to our customers this significant competition in making loans and attracting and retaining deposits as well as in providing other financial services may impact our future earnings and growth furthermore the financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks and smaller banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by larger banks competitors adopting new technologies could require us to make significant expenditures to modify or make additions to our current products and services additionally due to their size many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and as a result may offer a broader range of products and services than we do as well as better pricing for those products and services we may not realize the expected benefits from our efficiency and growth initiatives which could negatively impact our future profitability in the current competitive banking environment operating costs must reduce or grow much slower than overall revenue growth in addition we must continue to implement strategies to grow our loan portfolio and increase noninterest income in order to realize continued earnings growth and to remain competitive with the other banks in the markets we serve we are continuously implementing strategic efficiency and growth initiatives for expense reduction increased efficiencies and longterm growth while we have realized costsavings and growth as a result of these initiatives there is no guarantee that these initiatives will be successful in controlling expenses and growing revenues in the future in addition while expense control continues to be a major focus for us management also expects to continue to make strategic investments in technology and talent that are expected to improve our customer experience and support future growth which will require an increase in our expenditures there can be no assurance that we will ultimately realize the anticipated benefits of our expense reduction and growth strategies which may impair our earnings growth the implementation of new lines of business new products and services and new technologies may subject us to additional risk in we launched or enhanced a number of lines of business products and services and technologies including among others those related to our treasury and payments solutions business and assetbased and structured lending capabilities during we will continue these efforts to implement new products services and technologies designed to better serve our customers there are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts in developing and marketing new lines of business new products and services andor new technologies we undergo a new process to assess the risks of the initiative and invest significant time and resources to build internal controls policies and procedures to mitigate those risks including hiring experienced management to oversee the implementation of the initiative initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business new products or services andor new technologies may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible external factors such as compliance with regulations competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business a new product or service andor new technologies furthermore any new line of business new product or service andor new technology could require the establishment of new key and other controls and have a significant impact on our existing system of internal controls failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation could have a material adverse effect on our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations we may fail to fully realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of fcb during we devoted significant management time and resources in integrating fcb into our business while this integration effort is substantially complete we continue to manage the acquired business through the transition the success of this transition will depend on among other things our ability to realize anticipated costs savings and to manage the acquired assets and operations in a manner that permits growth opportunities and does not materially disrupt our existing customer relationships or result in decreased revenues resulting from any loss of customers we may encounter a number of difficulties including among others table start difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings synergies business opportunities and growth prospects from the merger table endtable start difficulties in the assimilation of employees table endtable start difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a larger and more complex company table endtable start challenges in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers table endtable start challenges in attracting and retaining key personnel including personnel that are considered key to the future success of our businesses table endtable start challenges related to the credit quality and credit risk of the acquired business and table endtable start challenges in keeping key business relationships in place table end many of these factors are outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs and liabilities decreases in the amount of expected income and diversion of managements time and energy which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition even if this transition is successfully managed the full benefits of the transaction may not be realized including the synergies cost savings growth opportunities or earnings accretion that are expected these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred including exposure to unexpected asset quality problems compliance and regulatory violations key employee and client retention problems and other problems that could result in significant costs to us all of these difficulties could cause dilution to our earnings per share decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the transaction negatively impact the price of our common stock or have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may pursue attractive bank and nonbank acquisition opportunities as they arise however even if we identify attractive acquisition opportunities we may not be able to complete such acquisitions on favorable terms or realize the anticipated benefits from such acquisitions while we continue to focus on organic growth opportunities and continue to integrate fcb into our business we anticipate continuing to evaluate both bank and nonbank acquisition opportunities that arise in our core markets and beyond the number of financial institutions headquartered in georgia florida the southeastern united states and across the country continues to decline through merger and other consolidation activity we expect that other banking and financial companies many of which have significantly greater resources will compete with us to acquire financial services businesses this competition as the number of appropriate merger targets decreases could increase prices for potential acquisitions which could reduce our potential returns and reduce the attractiveness of these opportunities to us as a result we may be unable to identify additional bank and nonbank acquisition opportunities that meet our acquisition criteria furthermore even if we do identify such acquisition opportunities we may be unable to complete such acquisitions on favorable terms if at all or realize the anticipated benefits from such acquisitions in addition any acquisition could be dilutive to our earnings and shareholders equity per share of our common stock also acquisitions are subject to various regulatory approvals including the approval of the frb and the ga dbf if we fail to receive the appropriate regulatory approvals we will not be able to consummate an acquisition that we believe is in our best interests additionally we may not be able to pursue an acquisition because of a perceived inability to obtain the required regulatory approvals in a timely manner among other things our regulators consider our capital liquidity profitability regulatory compliance including with respect to aml obligations consumer protection laws and cra obligations and levels of goodwill and intangibles when considering acquisition and expansion proposals we cannot be certain when or if or on what terms and conditions any required regulatory approvals would be granted if at all operational risk we may not be able to attract and retain key employees which may adversely impact our ability to successfully execute our growth and efficiency strategies our financial success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly motivated wellqualified personnel that we rely on to execute on our strategy and initiatives we face significant competition in the recruitment of qualified employees from financial institutions and others moreover as the banking industry transforms due to technological innovation we must continually assess and manage how our talent needs change over time in addition our future growth and the continued diversification of our loan portfolio depends in part on our ability to attract and retain the right mix of wellqualified employees if we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees our ability to execute our business strategies may suffer and we may be required to substantially increase our overall compensation or benefits to attract and retain such employees furthermore we generally do not have employment agreements in place with our management team and key team members and cannot guarantee that our management team and other key team members will remain with us the unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel especially members of our senior management team could have a material adverse impact on the business because we would lose their skills knowledge of the market years of industry experience and may have difficulty promptly finding qualified replacement personnel the financial services market is undergoing rapid technological changes and if we are unable to stay current with those changes we will not be able to effectively compete the financial services market including banking services is undergoing rapid changes with frequent introductions of new technologydriven products and services our future success will depend in part on our ability to keep pace with these technological changes and to use technology to satisfy and grow customer demand for our products and services and to create additional efficiencies in our operations we expect that we will need to make substantial investments in our technology and information systems to compete effectively and to stay current with technological changes some of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements and will be able to invest more heavily in developing and adopting new technologies which may put us at a competitive disadvantage some of these competitors consist of financial technology providers who are beginning to offer more traditional banking products and may eventually be able to provide additional services by obtaining a banklike charter such as the fintech charter provided by the occ furthermore companies may increasingly utilize artificial intelligence to deliver banking products and services which could become more competitive and efficient than traditional products and services we may not be able to effectively implement new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers as a result our ability to effectively compete to retain or acquire new business may be impaired and our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected we may not be able to successfully implement current or future information technology system enhancements and operational initiatives which could adversely affect our business operations and profitability we continue to invest significant resources in information technology system enhancements and operational initiatives in order to provide functionality and security at an appropriate level to improve our operating efficiency and to streamline our customer experience we may not be able to successfully implement and integrate such system enhancements and initiatives which could adversely impact the ability to comply with a number of legal and regulatory requirements which could result in sanctions from regulatory authorities in addition these projects could have higher than expected costs andor result in operating inefficiencies which could increase the costs associated with the implementation as well as ongoing operations failure to properly utilize system enhancements that are implemented in the future could result in impairment charges that adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations could result in significant costs to remediate or replace the defective components and could impact our ability to compete in addition we may incur significant training licensing maintenance consulting and amortization expenses during and after implementation and any such costs may continue for an extended period of time as such we cannot guarantee that the anticipated longterm benefits of these system enhancements and operational initiatives will be realized if our enterprise risk management framework is not effective at mitigating risk and loss to us we could suffer unexpected losses and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected our enterprise risk management framework seeks to achieve an appropriate balance between risk and return which is critical to optimizing shareholder value we have established processes and procedures intended to identify measure monitor report and analyze the types of risk to which we are subject including strategic market credit liquidity operational regulatory compliance litigation and reputational however as with any risk management framework there are inherent limitations to our risk management strategies as there may exist or develop in the future risks that we have not appropriately anticipated or identified for example the financial and credit crisis and resulting regulatory reform highlighted both the importance and some of the limitations of managing unanticipated risks if our risk management framework proves ineffective we could suffer unexpected losses and our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected we rely extensively on information technology systems to operate our business and an interruption or security breach may disrupt our business operations result in reputational harm and have an adverse effect on our operations as a large financial institution we rely extensively on our information technology systems to operate our business including to process record and monitor a large number of customer transactions on a continuous basis as customer public and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security have increased our operational systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures disruptions and breakdowns our business financial accounting data processing systems or other operating systems and facilities may stop operating properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control for example there could be sudden increases in customer transaction volume electrical or telecommunications outages natural disasters such as earthquakes tornadoes and hurricanes disease pandemics events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters including terrorist acts and as described below cyberattacks we have policies procedures and systems designed to prevent or limit the effect of possible failures interruptions or breaches in security of information systems and business continuity programs designed to provide services in the case of an event resulting in material disruptions of our operating systems we regularly seek to test the effectiveness of and enhance these policies procedures and systems however there is no guarantee that these safeguards or programs will address all of the threats that continue to evolve disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers or cyberattacks or security breaches of the networks systems or devices that our customers use to access our products and services could result in customer attrition regulatory and other fines penalties or intervention reputational damage reimbursement or other compensation costs andor additional compliance costs any of which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition we face significant cyber and data security risk that could result in the disclosure of confidential information adversely affect our business or reputation and expose us to significant liabilities as a large financial institution we are under continuous threat of loss due to the velocity and sophistication of cyberattacks this risk continues to increase and attack methods continue to evolve in sophistication velocity and frequency and can occur from a variety of sources such as foreign governments hacktivists or other wellfinanced entities and may originate from less regulated and remote areas of the world we continually review the security of our it systems and make the necessary investments to improve the resiliency of our systems and their security from attack nonetheless there remains the risk that we may be materially harmed by a cyberattack or information security breach further there is no guarantee that our response to any cyberattack or system interruption breach or failure will be effective to mitigate and remediate the issues resulting from such an event including the costs reputational harm and litigation challenges that we may face as result two of the most significant cyberattack risks that we face are efraud and loss of sensitive customer data loss from efraud occurs when cybercriminals breach and extract funds directly from customer or our accounts any loss of sensitive customer data that results from attempts to breach our systems such as account numbers and social security numbers would present significant reputational legal andor regulatory costs to us our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of the evolving nature and complexity of these threats from cybercriminals and hackers our plans to continue to provide internet banking and mobile banking channels and our plans to develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our customers while we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyberattacks or other information security breaches to date we have been the subject of attempted hacking and cyberattacks and there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future the occurrence of any cyberattack or information security breach could result in material adverse consequences to us including damage to our reputation and the loss of customers we also could face litigation or additional regulatory scrutiny litigation or regulatory actions in turn could lead to significant liability or other sanctions including fines and penalties or reimbursement to customers adversely affected by a security breach even if we do not suffer any material adverse consequences as a result of events affecting us directly successful attacks or systems failures at other large financial institutions could lead to a general loss of customer confidence in financial institutions including us our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business as such we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation this is done in part by recruiting hiring and retaining and providing growth opportunities for employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve delivering superior service to our customers caring about our customers and team members and investing in our information technology and other systems if our reputation is negatively affected by the actions of our employees or otherwise including as a result of operational errors clerical or recordkeeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems or a successful cyberattack against us or other unauthorized release or loss of customer information our reputation business and our operating results may be materially adversely affected damage to our reputation could also negatively impact our credit ratings and impede our access to the capital markets we rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure third parties provide key components of our business operations such as data processing recording and monitoring transactions online banking interfaces and services internet connections and network access we have selected these thirdparty vendors carefully and have conducted the due diligence consistent with regulatory guidance and best practices while we have ongoing programs to review third party vendors and assess risk we do not control their actions any problems caused by these third parties including those resulting from disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor issues at a thirdparty vendor of a vendor failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes cyberattacks and security breaches at a vendor failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason or poor performance of services could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business financial or operational difficulties of a thirdparty vendor could also hurt our operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendors ability to serve us furthermore our vendors could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints replacing these thirdparty vendors could also create significant delay and expense accordingly use of such third parties creates an unavoidable inherent risk to our business operations as an issuer of credit and debit cards we are exposed to losses in the event that holders of our cards experience fraud on their card accounts our customers regularly use synovusissued credit and debit cards to pay for transactions with retailers and other businesses there is the risk of data security breaches at these retailers and other businesses that could result in the misappropriation of our customers credit and debit card information when our customers use synovusissued cards to make purchases from those businesses card account information is provided to the business if the businesss systems that process or store card account information are subject to a data security breach holders of our cards who have made purchases from that business may experience fraud on their card accounts while the transition to emvenabled credit and debit cards reduced the likelihood of fraudulent transactions and the associated costs we may nonetheless suffer losses associated with reimbursing our customers for fraudulent transactions on customers card accounts as well as for other costs related to data security compromise events such as replacing cards associated with compromised card accounts in addition we provide card transaction processing services to some merchant customers under agreements we have with payment networks such as visa and mastercard under these agreements we may be responsible for certain losses and penalties if one of our merchant customers suffers a data security breach in the last several years a number of large retailers suffered substantial data security breaches compromising millions of credit and debit card accounts to date our losses and costs related to these breaches have not been material but other similar events in the future could be more significant to us our independent sales organization relationships are complex and may expose us to losses we maintain relationships with a number of isos which are organizations that are not visa or mastercard member banks but which are associated with us as a member bank these isos generally act as intermediaries for third party companies that want to develop the capacity to accept payment cards and iso activities include among other things acquiring and issuing functions soliciting merchants and other customers soliciting cardholders underwriting and monitoring arranging for terminal leases or purchases account and transaction processing and customer service our iso relationships include but are not limited to our relationships with mps where we process credit and debit card transactions on behalf of various merchants because our iso program entails a host of complex business relationships with third parties we face risks related to our oversight and supervision of the program as well as to the reputation and financial viability of the isos with which we do business our oversight and supervision responsibilities include but are not limited to monitoring of the iso program and relationships compliance portfolio awareness reputational monitoring and risk monitoring any failure by us to appropriately oversee and supervise our iso program could damage our reputation result in regulatory or compliance issues result in third party litigation and cause financial losses to us further our iso program is highly dependent upon the activities and financial viability of our iso counterparties and any negative developments at the isos reputational compliancerelated financial or otherwise may present financial losses and other risk to us the costs and effects of litigation investigations or similar matters involving us or other financial institutions or counterparties or adverse facts and developments related thereto could materially affect our business operating results and financial condition we may be involved from time to time in a variety of litigation investigations inquiries or similar matters arising out of our business including those described in part i item legal proceedings and part ii item financial statements and supplementary data note commitments and contingencies of this report we manage those risks through internal controls personnel training insurance litigation management our compliance and ethics processes and other means however the commencement outcome and magnitude of litigation cannot be predicted or controlled with any certainty we establish reserves for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the losses can be reasonably estimated we may still incur legal costs for a matter even if we have not established a reserve in addition the actual cost of resolving a legal claim may be substantially higher than any amounts reserved for that matter for those legal matters where the amounts associated with the claims are not probable and the costs cannot be reasonably estimated synovus estimates a range of reasonably possible losses as of december synovus management currently estimates the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses resulting from our outstanding litigation including without limitation the matters described in this report is from zero to million in excess of the amounts accrued if any related to those matters this estimated aggregate range is based upon information currently available to us and the actual losses could prove to be higher as there are further developments in these legal matters we will reassess these matters and the estimated range of reasonably possible losses may change as a result of this assessment in addition in the future we may need to record additional litigation reserves with respect to these matters further regardless of how these matters proceed it could significantly harm our reputation and divert our managements attention and other resources away from our business our insurance may not cover all claims that may be asserted against it and indemnification rights to which we are entitled may not be honored and any claims asserted against us regardless of merit or eventual outcome may harm our reputation should the ultimate judgments or settlements in any litigation or investigation significantly exceed our insurance coverage they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition premiums for insurance covering the financial and banking sectors are rising we may not be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future nor may we be able to obtain adequate replacement policies with acceptable terms or at historic rates if at all credit and liquidity risk our allowance for credit losses may not cover actual losses and we may be required to materially increase our allowance which may adversely affect our capital financial condition and results of operations effective january the fasb adopted a new accounting standard known as the current expected credit loss cecl for the recognition and measurement of credit losses for loans and certain other instruments cecl represents a significant change in methodology and greatly increased the types of data we will need to collect and review the determine the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses we derive the most significant portion of our revenues from our lending activities when we lend money commit to lend money or enter into a letter of credit or other contract with a counterparty we incur credit risk which is the risk of losses if our borrowers do not repay their loans or our counterparties fail to perform according to the terms of their contracts we estimate and maintain an allowance for credit losses which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expenses representing managements best estimate of probable credit losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans as described under part ii item financial statements and supplementary data note summary of significant accounting policies and part ii item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses in this report the allowance in the judgment of management is established to reserve for estimated credit losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks using existing qualitative and quantitative information all of which may undergo material changes changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers new information regarding existing loans identification of additional problem loans changes in assumptions regarding a borrowers ability to pay changes in collateral values risk ratings and other factors both within and outside of our control may cause the allowance for credit losses to become inadequate and require an increase in the provision for loan losses while we are continuing to evaluate the impact of cecl we expect that the allowance for credit losses will be higher under the new standard and as such could have an impact on our results of operations moreover the cecl model may create more volatility in the level of our allowance for credit losses for a discussion of changes in accounting standards and regulatory capital implications see part item business supervision regulation and other factors capital requirements various regulatory agencies as an integral part of their examination procedures periodically review the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination such agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowance or additional loan charge offs an increase in the allowance for credit losses would result in a decrease in net income and capital and could have a material adverse effect on our capital financial condition and results of operations if synovus bank is unable to grow its deposits it may be subject to liquidity risk and higher funding costs the total amount that we pay for funding costs is dependent in part on synovus banks ability to grow and retain its deposits if synovus bank is unable to sufficiently grow and retain its deposits at competitive rates to meet liquidity needs it may be subject to paying higher funding costs to meet these liquidity needs synovus bank competes with banks and other financial services companies for deposits if competitors raise the rates they pay on deposits synovus banks funding costs may increase either because synovus bank raises rates to avoid losing deposits or because synovus bank loses deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of funding this could result in a failure to maintain adequate liquidity and higher funding costs reducing our net interest margin and net interest income in addition our access to deposits may be affected by the liquidity needs of our depositors in particular a substantial majority of our liabilities in were checking accounts and other liquid deposits which are payable on demand or upon several days notice while by comparison a substantial majority of our assets were loans which cannot be called or sold in the same time frame moreover our customers could withdraw their deposits in favor of alternative investments while we have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances as necessary we may not be able to replace such funds in the future especially if large number of our depositors seek to withdraw their accounts regardless of the reason changes in the cost and availability of funding due to changes in the deposit market and credit market may adversely affect our capital resources liquidity and financial results we may be unable to access historical and alternative sources of liquidity including the capital markets brokered deposits and borrowings from the fhlb which could adversely affect our overall liquidity liquidity represents the extent to which we have readily available sources of funding to meet the needs of our depositors borrowers and creditors to support asset growth and to otherwise sustain our operations and the operations of our subsidiary bank in managing our consolidated balance sheet we depend on access to a variety of sources of funding to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs and to accommodate the transaction and cash management needs of our customers sources of funding available to us and upon which we rely as regular components of our liquidity and funding management strategy include borrowings from the fhlb and brokered deposits see part ii item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and part ii item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital resources of this report for further information we also have historically enjoyed a solid reputation in the capital markets and have been able to raise funds in the form of either short or longterm borrowings or equity or debt issuances if due to market disruptions perceptions about our credit ratings or other factors we are unable to access the capital markets in the future our capital resources and liquidity may be adversely affected in general the amount type and cost of our funding including from other financial institutions the capital markets and deposits directly impacts our costs of operating our business and growing our assets and can therefore positively or negatively affect our financial results a number of factors could make funding more difficult more expensive or unavailable on any terms including but not limited to a downgrade in our credit ratings financial results changes within our organization specific events that adversely impact our reputation disruptions in the capital markets specific events that adversely impact the financial services industry counterparty availability changes affecting our assets the corporate and regulatory structure interest rate fluctuations general economic conditions and the legal regulatory accounting and tax environments governing our funding transactions also we compete for funding with other banks and similar companies many of which are substantially larger and have more capital and other resources than we do in addition as some of these competitors consolidate with other financial institutions these advantages may increase competition from these institutions may increase the cost of funds in addition to bank level liquidity management we must manage liquidity at the parent company for various needs including potential capital infusions into subsidiaries the servicing of debt the payment of dividends on our common stock and preferred stock and share repurchases the primary source of liquidity for us consists of dividends from synovus bank which are governed by certain rules and regulations of our supervising agencies during synovus bank paid upstream cash dividends to the parent company of million in synovus bank and nonbank subsidiaries made upstream cash distributions to the parent company totaling million including cash dividends of million synovus ability to receive dividends from synovus bank in future periods will depend on a number of factors including without limitation synovus banks future profits asset quality liquidity and overall condition in addition ga dbf rules and related statutes contain additional restrictions on payments of dividends by synovus bank in particular the georgia financial institutions code contains restrictions on the ability of a georgia bank to pay dividends other than from retained earnings and under other circumstances without the approval of the ga dbf as a result of these restrictions synovus bank may be required to seek approval from the ga dbf to pay dividends see part i item risk factors we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our debt and repay maturing debt obligations and part item business supervision regulation and other factors payment of dividends of this report for further information synovus expects that it will receive additional dividends from synovus bank in if synovus does not receive additional dividends from synovus bank in at the levels anticipated its liquidity could be adversely affected and it may not be able to continue to execute its current capital plan to return capital to its shareholders in addition to dividends from synovus bank we have historically had access to a number of alternative sources of liquidity including the capital markets but there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain such liquidity on terms that are favorable to us or at all if our access to these traditional and alternative sources of liquidity is diminished or only available on unfavorable terms then our overall liquidity and financial condition will be adversely affected changes in interest rates may have an adverse effect on our net interest income net interest income which is the difference between the interest income that we earn on interestearning assets and the interest expense that we pay on interestbearing liabilities is a major component of our income and our primary source of revenue from our operations a further narrowing of interest rate spreads could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition we cannot control or predict with certainty changes in interest rates regional and local economic conditions competitive pressures and the policies of regulatory authorities including monetary policies of the frb affect interest income and interest expense if interest rates were to increase it could have a negative impact on our business by reducing the amount of money our customers borrow or by adversely affecting their ability to repay outstanding loan balances that may increase due to adjustments in their variable rates in addition if interest rates were to increase in order to compete for deposits in our primary market areas we may have to offer more attractive interest rates to depositors or pursue other sources of liquidity such as wholesale funds if interest rates were to decrease our yield on our variable rate loans and on our new loans would decrease reducing our net interest income in addition lower interest rates may reduce our realized yields on investment securities which would reduce our net interest income and cause downward pressure on net interest margin in future periods a significant reduction in our net interest income could have a material adverse impact on our capital financial condition and results of operations we have ongoing policies and procedures designed to manage the risks associated with changes in market interest rates and actively manage these risks through hedging and other risk mitigation strategies however if our assumptions are wrong or overall economic conditions are significantly different than anticipated our risk mitigation techniques may be ineffective or costly changes in our asset quality could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition asset quality measures the performance of a borrower in repaying a loan with interest on time while we believe we have benefited from relatively stable asset quality there are elements of our loan portfolio that inherently present greater credit risk while we believe that we manage asset quality through prudent underwriting practices and collection operations it is possible that our asset quality could deteriorate depending upon economic conditions and other factors we could realize losses if we determine to sell nonperforming assets and the proceeds we receive are lower than the carrying value of such assets distressed asset sales have been a component of our strategy to further strengthen the balance sheet improve asset quality and enhance earnings we could realize future losses if the proceeds we receive upon dispositions of nonperforming assets are lower than the recorded carrying value of such assets which could adversely affect our results of operations in future periods accordingly we could realize an increased level of credit costs in any period during which we determine to dispose of an increased level of distressed assets further although market conditions have improved significantly over the past decade if market conditions experience another downturn this could negatively impact our ability to dispose of distressed assets and may result in higher credit losses on sales of distressed assets we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our debt and repay maturing debt obligations as of december we and our consolidated subsidiaries had billion of longterm debt outstanding our ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest or to satisfy our obligations in respect of our debt to refinance our debt or to fund capital expenditures will depend on our future financial and operating performance and our ability to maintain adequate liquidity prevailing economic conditions including interest rates and regulatory constraints including among other things on distributions to us from our subsidiaries and required capital levels with respect to our subsidiary bank and financial subsidiaries business and other factors many of which are beyond our control may also affect our ability to meet these needs we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or obtain future borrowings in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on maturity and we may not be able to refinance any of our debt when needed on commercially reasonable terms or at all if our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay investments in our business sell assets seek to obtain additional equity or debt financing or restructure our debt on terms that may not be favorable to us we may be unable to pay dividends on our common stock and preferred stock holders of our common stock and preferred stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments although we have historically paid a quarterly cash dividend to the holders of our common stock and preferred stock we are not legally required to do so further the federal reserve could decide at any time that paying any dividends on our common stock or preferred stock could be an unsafe or unsound banking practice the reduction or elimination of dividends paid on our common stock or preferred stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock or preferred stock as applicable in addition if we fail to pay dividends on our preferred stock for six quarters whether or not consecutive the holders of such preferred stock shall be entitled to certain rights to elect two directors to our board of directors for a discussion of current regulatory limits on our ability to pay dividends see part item business supervision regulation and other factors payment of dividends and part i item risk factors we may become subject to supervisory actions and enhanced regulation that could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation operating flexibility financial condition and the value of our common

weather catastrophes public health issues and other external events which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition our operations are concentrated in the southeastern us in the states of alabama florida georgia south carolina and tennessee as a result local economic conditions significantly affect the demand for loans and other products we offer to our customers including real estate commercial and construction loans the ability of borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans economic downturns in these regions could adversely affect our currently performing loans leading to future delinquencies or defaults and increases in our provision for credit losses in addition the occurrence of events such as hurricanes tropical storms tornados winter storms and other largescale weather catastrophes in and along the gulf and the atlantic coasts as well as other parts of the southeastern us and public health issues

publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after us regulatory authorities have voiced similar support for phasing out libor it is unclear whether at that time libor will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating libor will be established and no consensus exists at this time as to what benchmark rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to libor in the us efforts to identify a set of alternative us dollar reference interest rates include proposals by the alternative reference rates committee of the federal reserve and the federal reserve bank of new york and its secured overnight finance rate sofr as an alternative to libor sofr is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash in the overnight us treasury repurchase market at this time it is impossible to predict whether sofr or another reference rate will become an accepted alternative to libor the uncertainty regarding the future of libor as well as the transition from libor to another benchmark rate or rates is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on our business financial condition and results of operations in particular any such transition could table start adversely affect the interest rates paid or received on and the revenue and expenses associated with and the value of synovus floating rate obligations loans deposits

interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships defaults by or even rumors or questions about one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally have led to marketwide liquidity problems and losses of depositor creditor and counterparty confidence and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions we could experience increases in deposits and assets as a result of other banks difficulties or failure which would increase the capital we need to support our growth changes in tax laws and interpretations and tax challenges may affect our earnings negatively the enactment of federal tax reform has had and is e xpected to continue to have far reaching and significant effects on us our customers and the us economy further us tax authorities may at any time clarify andor modify by legislation administration or judicial changes or interpretations the income tax treatment of corporations such changes could adversely affect us either directly or as a result of the effects on our customers as of december our balance sheet included net deferred tax assets of approximately million net of valuation allowance of million our ability to continue to record this deferred tax asset is dependent on our ability to realize its value through future projected earnings and tax planning strategies loss of part or all of this asset would adversely impact tangible capital and could have a material adverse effect on earnings currently million of our deferred tax assets are disallowed for regulatory purposes in the course of our business we are sometimes subject to challenges from taxing authorities including the irs individual states and municipalities regarding amounts due these challenges may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or allocation of income among tax jurisdictions all of which may require a greater provisioning for taxes or otherwise affect earnings negatively our stock price is subject to fluctuations and the value of your investment may decline the trading price of our common stock is subject to wide fluctuations the stock market in general and the market for the stocks of commercial banks and other financial services companies in particular has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that sometimes have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance and the value of your investment may decline certain shares of our common stock are entitled to ten votes per share on each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of shareholders although we only have one class of common stock certain shares of our common stock are entitled to ten votes per share on each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of shareholders including common stock that has been beneficially owned continuously by the same shareholder for a period of fortyeight consecutive months before the record date of any meeting of shareholders at which the share is eligible to be voted therefore while a holder of common stock may have an economic interest in us that is identical to or even greater than another shareholder that other shareholder may be entitled to ten times as many votes per share as a result some groups of shareholders will be able to approve strategic transactions or increases in authorized capital stock among other matters submitted to the shareholders even over the objections of shareholders who hold equivalent or greater economic stakes in our company our articles of incorporation and certain banking laws and regulations may have an antitakeover effect provisions of our charter and certain federal and state banking laws and regulations including regulatory approval requirements could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to our shareholders the combination of these charter and statutory provisions may inhibit a nonnegotiated merger or other business combination making us less attractive to a potential acquirer which in turn could adversely affect the market price of our common stock
