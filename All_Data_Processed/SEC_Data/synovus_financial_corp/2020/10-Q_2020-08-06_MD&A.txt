tax benefits related to sharebased compensation jurisdiction statutory tax rate changes valuation allowance changes income tax credits earned and changes to unrecognized tax benefits accordingly the

monitor current and projected capital levels liquidity including div idends from subsidiaries financial markets and other economic trends as well as regulatory requirements regarding the payment of dividends as synovus navigates through the current recession and regulatory guidelines the approach to common stock dividends will be continually evaluated based on an assessment of longterm earnings capital projections and liquidity synovus ability to pay dividends on its common stock and preferred stock is primarily dependent upon dividends and distributions that it receives from its bank and nonbanking subsidiar ies which are restricted by various regulations administered by federal and state bank regulatory authorities synovus declared common stock dividends of million or per common share for the six months ended june up from million or per common share for the six months ended june respectively in addition synovus declared dividends on its preferred stock of million and million

economic competitive and regulatory environment and is responsible for measuring monitoring and reporting on liquidity and funding risk as well as market risk in accordance with synovus policies and regulatory guidance alco evaluates contractual and anticipated cash flows under normal and stressed conditions to properly manage the companys liquidity profile synovus places an emphasis on maintaining numerous sources of current and contingent liquidity to meet its obligations to depositors borrowers and creditors on a timely basis liquidity is generated through various sources including but not limited to maturities and repayments of loans by customers maturities and sales of investment securities and growth in core or wholesale deposits management continuously monitors and maintains appropriate levels of liquidity so as to provide adequate funding sources to manage customer deposit withdrawals loan requests and other funding demands synovus bank also generates liquidity through the issuance of brokered certificates of deposit and money market accounts synovus bank accesses these funds from a broad geographic base to diversify its sources of fu nding and liquidity synovus bank also has t he capacity to access funding through its membership in the fhlb system and through the federal reserve discount window during the first quarter of synovus increased its fhlb availability by over billion through expanding pledged collateral at june based on currently pledged collateral synovus bank had access to incremental fhlb funding of billion subject to fhlb credit policies in addition to bank level liquidity management synovus must manage liquidity at the parent company level for various operating needs including the servicing of debt the payment of dividends on our common stock and preferred stock share repurchases payment of general corporate expenses and potential capital infusions into subsidiaries the primary source of liquidity for synovus consists of dividends from synovus bank which is governed by certain rules and regulations of the ga dbf and the federal reserve bank synovus ability to receive dividends from synovus bank in future periods will depend on a number of factors including without limitation synovus banks future profits asset quality liquidit y and overall condition i n addition both the ga dbf and federal reserve bank may require approval to pay dividends based on certain regulatory statutes and limitations on february synovus bank issued million aggregate principal amount of fixedtofloating rate senior bank notes due from and including the original issue date to but excluding february the notes bear interest at a fixed rate of p er annum payable semiannually in arrears on each february and august beginning on august unless redeemed from and including february to but excluding the maturity date the interest rate on the notes is computed quarterly using an interest rate based on the sofr with a daily index maturity plus a spread of bps per annum payable quarterly in arrears synovus bank may redeem the notes at its option on february which is the date that is one year prior to the maturity date upon not less than nor more than days prior notice given to holders of the notes the redemption price for any redemption is of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to but excluding the date of redemption the notes are not redeemable at the option or election of holders on february synovus terminated a million longterm fhlb obligation and incurred a million loss on early extinguishment of debt synovus presently believes that the sources of liquidity discussed above including existing liquid funds on hand are sufficient to meet its anticipated funding needs however if economic conditions were to significantly deteriorate regulatory capital requirements for synovus or synovus bank were to increase as the result of regulatory directives or otherwise or synovus believes it is prudent to enhance current liquidity levels then synovus may seek additional liquidity from external sources see part i item risk factors the covid19 pandemic has resulted in significant market volatility and lower interest rates that could materially affect synovus results of operations and access to capital of this report and part i item risk factors changes in the cost and availability of funding due to changes in the deposit market and credit market may adversely affect our capital resources liquidity and financial results of synovus form 10k furthermore synovus

billion or to billion for the first six months of compared to the same period in due largely to liquidity associated with ppp lending net interest income for the six months ended june was million down million or compared to the same period in the decrease in yearoveryear net interest income was due to declines of million in paa primarily comprised of declines of million of loan accretion and million of deposit premium amortization associated with the fcb acquisition and declines in market interest rates which were somewhat offset by higher average earning assets net interest margin was down bps over the comparable sixmonth periods to due primarily to the decline in market intere st rates in addition to declines in paa for the six months ended june the yield on earning assets was a

over the six months ended june on a sequential quarter basis net interest income was up million or and net interest margin for the second quarter was which was down bps compared to the first quarter of the sequential quarter decline in net interest margin was primarily driven by the full quarter impact of the march emergency rate cuts by the federal reserve as well as excess liquidity the second

calculated by dividing annualized net interest income fte by average total interest earnings assets market risk analysis interest rate risk is the primary market risk to which synovus is potentially exposed synovus measures its sensitivity to changes in market interest rates through the use of a simulation model which incorporates all of synovus earning assets and liabilities these simulations are used to determine a baseline net interest income projection and the sensitivity of the income profile based on changes in interest rates these simula tions incorporate assumptions and factors including but not limited to changes in market rates in the size or composition of the balance sheet and in repricing characteris tics as well as customer behaviors this process is reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis in a manner consistent with synovus alco governance framework synovus has modeled its baseline net interest income projection assuming a flat interest rate environment with the federal funds rate at the federal reserves current targeted range of to and the current prime rate of synovus has modeled the impact of a gradual increase in market interest rates across the yield curve of and bps and a gradual decline of bps to determine the sensitivity of net interest income for the next twelve months the lesser decline of the downrate scenario presented was selected in light of the low absolute level of monetary policy rates and generally incorporates an assumption that rates are floored at the zerolowerbound synovus current rate risk position is considered modestly assetsensitive and would be expected to benefit net interest income in a rising interest rate environment and reduce net interest income in a declining interest rate environment the following table represents the estimated sensitivity of net interest income at june with comparable information for december table twelve month net interest income sensitivity estimated change in net interest income as compared to unchanged rates for the next twelve months change in shortterm interest rates in bps june december flat na the net interest income simulation model is the primary tool utilized to evaluate potential interest rate risks over a shorterterm time horizon synovus also evaluates potential longerterm interest rate risk through modeling and evaluation of eve simulation modeling is utilized to measure the eve and its sensitivity to immediate changes in interest rates this eve modeling allows synovus to capture longerterm repricing risk and options risk embedded in the balance sheet these simulations value only the current balance sheet and do not incorporate growth assumptions used in the net interest income simulation the eve is the net fair value of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet financial instruments derived from the present value of future cash flows discounted at current market interest rates from this baseline valuation synovus evaluates changes in the value of each of these items in various interest rate scenarios to determine the net impact on the eve key assumptions utilized in the model namely loan prepayments investment security prepayments deposit repricing betas and nonmaturity deposit duration have a significant impact on the results of the eve simulations libor in july the financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after confirming the continuation of libor will not be guaranteed beyond that date however due to the covid19 pandemic the fca has since softened its stance on the precessation end dates scheduled in and early on the issuance of instruments tied to libor the arrc has proposed sofr as its preferred rate as an alternative to libor and has proposed a paced market transition plan to sofr from libor the arrc recently recommended a spread adjustment methodology for cash products based on a historical median over a fiveyear lookback period calculating the difference between libor and sofr organizations are currently working on industrywide and companyspecific transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to libor as noted within our 10k risk factors synovus holds instruments that may be impacted by the discontinuance of libor including floating rate obligations loans deposits derivatives and hedges and other financial instruments but is not able to currently predict the associated financial impacts of the transition to an alternative reference rate synovus has established a crossfunctional libor transition working group that is in the process of i assessing the companys current exposure to libor indexed instruments and the data systems and processes that may also be impacted ii establishing an implementation plan and iii developing a formal governance structure for the transition critical accounting policies the accounting and financial reporting policies of synovus are in accordance with gaap and conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities synovus has identified certain of its accounting policies as critical accounting policies consisting of those related to the allowance for loan losses fair value measurements and income taxes in determining which accounting policies are critical in nature synovus has identified the policies that require significant judgment or involve complex estimates it is managements practice to discuss critical accounting policies with the board of directors audit committee including the development selection implementation and disclosure of the critical accounting policies the application of these policies has a significant impact on synovus unaudited

total noninterest revenue total noninterest expense total revenues efficiency ratiofte net income per common share diluted return on average assets return on average common equity and the ratio of total shareholders equity to total assets respectively management believes that these nongaap financial measures provide meaningful additional information about synovus to assist management and investors in evaluating synovus operating results financial strength the performance of its business and the strength of its capital position however these nongaap financial measures have inherent limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of operating results or capital position as reported under gaap the nongaap financial measures should be considered as additional views of the way our financial measures are affected by significant items and other factors and since they are not required to be uniformly applied they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures at other companies adjusted total revenues and adjusted noninterest revenue are measures used by management to evaluate noninterest revenue exclusive of net investment securities gains losses and gains on sale and changes in fair value of private equity investments net adjusted noninterest expense and the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio are measures utilized by management to measure the success of expense management initiatives focused on reducing recurring controllable operating costs adjusted net income per common share diluted

indicative of ongoing operations and impact periodtoperiod comparisons return on average tangible common equity and adjusted return on average tangible common equity are measures used by management to compare synovus performance with other financial institutions because it calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization
