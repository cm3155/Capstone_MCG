other assets were at march compared to at december and at march total npas were million at march compared to million at december and million at march the sequential increase in npls and npas primarily related to the designation of a large ci relationship as nonperforming which is collateralized and carries a specific reserve the npl ratio at at march is up only bp over march and total past dues of at march improved over both december and march provision for credit losses and allowance for credit losses synovus adoption of cecl resulted in a january acl increase of million or over december provision for credit losses of million for the three months ended march included the impact of the covid19 healthcare crisis and the first quarter under cecl the acl at march totaled million consisting of an all of million and reserve for unfunded commitments of million resulting in an acl to loans coverage ratio of and an acl to npls ratio of our modeling process incorporates quantitative and qualitative considerations that are used to inform cecl estimates the internally developed economic forecast used to determine the allowance for credit losses as of march was approved late in the first quarter pursuant to synovus economic forecasting governance processes between that approval date and march we saw further deterioration in the economic outlook which resulted in the need for a qualitative overlay to our allowance for credit losses the qualitative overlay of million adds bps to the allowance for credit losses and better aligns the total allowance with the economic indicators and forecasts at march economic projections are an important consideration in cecl estimates significant economic uncertainty remains as a result of the continuing healthcare crisis and the ultimate impact of government stimulation efforts if our economic outlook on june evidences further deterioration as might be suggested by certain external economic forecasts then we would expect to see a further increase in the allowance for credit losses table accruing tdrs by risk grade march december march  in thousands amount amount amount pass special mention substandard accruing total accruing tdrs troubled debt restructurings accruing tdrs were million at march compared to million at december and million at march accruing tdrs increased million from december and million from march nonaccruing tdrs were million at march compared to million at december and million at march the primary driver of the increase in accruing tdrs compared to december is a result of a large relationship being designated as an accruing tdr due to interest rate and term concessions accruing tdrs are considered performing because they are performing in accordance with the re structured terms at march december and march approximately and respectively of accruing tdrs were current in addition subsequent defaults on accruing tdrs defaults defined as the earlier of the tdr being placed on nonaccrual

covid19 regulatory agencies as set forth in the interagency statement on loan modifications and reporting for financial institutions working with customers affected by the coronavirus initially issued on march and revised on april have encouraged financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers who are or may be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations because of the effects of covid19 in this statement the regulatory agencies expressed their view of loan modification programs as positive actions that may mitigate adverse effects on borrowers due to covid19 and that the agencies will not criticize institutions for working with borrowers in a safe and sound manner moreover the revised statement provides that eligible loan modifications related to covid19 may be accounted for under section of the cares act or in accordance with asc section of the cares act allows banks to elect to not consider loan modifications related to covid19 that are made between march and the earlier of december or days after the covid19 national emergency ends to borrowers that are current ie less than days past due as of december as tdrs the regulatory agencies further stated that performing loans granted payment deferrals due to covid19 are not considered past due or nonaccrual fasb confirmed the foregoing regulatory agencies view that such shortterm modifications eg six months made on a goodfaith basis in response to covid19 for borrowers who are current are not tdrs accordingly beginning in late march synovus provided relief programs consisting primarily of 90day payment deferral relief to borrowers negatively impacted by covid19 at march synovus had approved payment deferral relief to borrowers due to the effects of covid19 on approximately billion or

requirements inclusive of the capital conservation buffer synovus is suspending share repurchase activity beyond the million thousand shares of its common stock repurchased during the first quarter under the share repurchase program announced on january due to greater economic uncertainty on march the federal banking regulators issued an interim final rule updating cecl transition options which allows electing banking organizations to delay an estimate of the effect of cecl on regulatory capital for up to two years followed by a threeyear phasein transition period synovus adopted cecl on january and the march regulatory capital ratios reflect synovus election of the fiveyear transition provision for additional information on synovus adoption of cecl see part i item financial statements and supplementary data note basis of presentation and accounting policies in this report dividends synovus has historically paid a quarterly cash dividend to the holders of its common stock management and the board of directors closely monitor current and projected capital levels liquidity including dividends from subsidiaries financial markets and other economic trends as well as regulatory requirements regarding the payment of dividends as synovus navigates through the current recession the approach to common stock dividends will be continually evaluated based on an assessment of longterm earnings capital projections and liquidity synovus ability to pay dividends on its common stock and preferred stock is primarily dependent upon dividends and distributions that it receives from its bank and nonbanking subsidiar ies which are restricted by various regulations administered by federal and state bank regulatory authorities synovus declared common stock dividends of million or per common share for the three months ended march up from million or per common share for the three months ended march respectively in addition synovus declared dividends on its preferred stock of million and million during the three months ended march and respectively liquidity liquidity represents the extent to which synovus has readily available sources of funding to meet the needs of depositors borrowers and creditors to support asset growth and to otherwise sustain operations of synovus and its subsidiaries at a reasonable cost on a timely basis and without adverse consequences alco monitors synovus economic competitive and regulatory environment and is responsible for measuring monitoring and reporting on liquidity and funding risk interest rate risk and market risk in accordance with synovus policies and regulatory guidance alco evaluates contractual and anticipated cash flows under normal and stressed conditions to properly manage the companys liquidity profile synovus places an emphasis on maintaining numerous sources of current and contingent liquidity to meet its obligations to depositors borrowers and creditors on a timely basis liquidity is generated through various sources including but not limited to maturities and repayments of loans by customers maturities and sales of investment securities and growth in core or wholesale deposits management continuously monitors and maintains appropriate levels of liquidity so as to provide adequate funding sources to manage customer deposit withdrawals loan requests and other funding demands synovus bank also generates liquidity through the issuance of brokered certificates of deposit and money market accounts synovus bank accesses these funds from a broad geographic base to diversify its sources of fu nding and liquidity synovus bank also has the capacity to access funding through its membership in the fhlb system and through the federal reserve discount window during the first quarter of synovus increased its fhlb availability by over billion through expanding pledged collateral at march based on currently pledged collateral synovus bank had access to incremental fhlb funding of billion subject to fhlb credit policies in addition synovus expects to have considerable liquidity available through the federal reserves paycheck protection program lending facility in addition to bank level liquidity management synovus must manage liquidity at the parent company level for various operating needs including the servicing of debt the payment of dividends on our common stock and preferred stock share repurchases payment of general corporate expenses and potential capital infusions into subsidiaries the primary source of liquidity for synovus consists of dividends from synovus bank which is governed by certain rules and regulations of the ga dbf and the federal reserve bank synovus ability to receive dividends from synovus bank in future periods will depend on a number of factors including without limitation synovus banks future profits asset quality liquidit y and overall condition i n addition both the ga dbf and federal reserve bank may require approval to pay dividends based on certain regulatory statutes and limitations on february synovus bank issued million aggregate principal amount of fixedtofloating rate senior bank notes due from and including the original issue date to but excluding february the notes bear interest at a fixed rate of p er annum payable semiannually in arrears on each february and august beginning on august unless redeemed from and including february to but excluding the maturity date the interest rate on the notes is computed quarterly using an interest rate based on the sofr with a daily index maturity plus a spread of bps per annum payable quarterly in arrears synovus bank may redeem the notes at its option on february which is the date that is one year prior to the maturity date upon not less than nor more than days prior notice given to holders of the notes the redemption price for any redemption is of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to but excluding the date of redemption the notes are not redeemable at the option or election of holders on february synovus terminated a million longterm fhlb obligation and incurred a million loss on early extinguishment of debt synovus presently believes that the sources of liquidity discussed above including existing liquid funds on hand are sufficient to meet its anticipated funding needs however if economic conditions were to significantly deteriorate regulatory capital requirements for synovus or synovus bank were to increase as the result of regulatory directives or otherwise or synovus believes it is prudent to enhance current liquidity levels then synovus may seek additional liquidity from external sources see part i item risk factors the covid19 pandemic has resulted in significant market volatility and lower interest rates that could materially affect synovus results of operations and access to capital of this report and part i item risk factors changes in the cost and availability of funding due to changes in the deposit market and credit market may adversely affect our capital resources liquidity and financial results of synovus form 10k furthermore synovus may from time to time take advantage of attractive market opportunities to refinance its existing debt redeem its preferred stock or strengthen its liquidity or capital position earning assets and

noninterestbearing demand deposits increased million or to billion for the first three months of compared to the same period in net interest income was million for the three months ended march down million or compared to the same period of the net interest margin was down bps to due primarily to the decline in market interest rates and decline of million in paa primarily comprised of million of loan accretion and million of deposit premium amortization associated with the fcb acquisition for the three months ended march the yield on earning assets was a decrease of bps compared to the three months ended march while the total cost of funds decreased bps to the yield on loans decreased bps to while the yield on investment securities increased bps to over the three months ended march on a sequential quarter basis net interest income was down million or and the net interest margin for the first quarter was which was down bps compared to the fourth quarter of the sequential quarter decline in net interest income and margin included a decline of million in paa primarily comprised of million of loan accretion and million of deposit premium amortization associated with the fcb acquisition as well as declines in market interest rates including a series of emergency rate cuts by the federal reserve in march the net interest margin excluding the impact of purchase accounting adjustments was down bps sequentially to for the first quarter of driven by a bp decrease in the yield on earning assets and a bp decrease in the effective cost of funds synovus expects net interest income in the second quarter to be relatively flat compared to first quarter levels as a result of significant loan growth associated with the ppp however with this growth along with a depressed rate

the three months ended march and respectively the net interest margin is calculated by dividing annualized net interest income fte by average total interest earnings assets market risk analysis interest rate risk is the primary market risk to which synovus is potentially exposed synovus measures its sensitivity to changes in market interest rates through the use of a simulation model synovus uses this simulation model to determine a baseline net interest income forecast and the sensitivity of this forecast to changes in interest rates these simulations include all of synovus earning assets and liabilities forecasted balance sheet changes primarily reflecting loan and deposit growth forecasts are included in the periods modeled anticipated deposit mix changes in each interest rate scenario are also included in the periods modeled assumptions utilized in the model are updated on an ongoing basis and are reviewed and approved by alco and the risk committee of the board of directors synovus has modeled its baseline net interest income forecast assuming a flat interest rate environment with the federal funds rate at the federal reserves current targeted range of to and the current prime rate of synovus has modeled the impact of a gradual increase in the targeted federal funds range and the prime rate of and bps and a gradual decline of bps to determine the sensitivity of net interest income for the next twelve months synovus current rate risk position is considered modestly assetsensitive and would be expected to benefit net interest income in a rising interest rate environment and reduce net interest income in a declining interest rate environment the following table represents the estimated sensitivity of net interest income at march with comparable information for december table twelve month net interest income sensitivity estimated change in net interest income as compared to unchanged rates for the next twelve months change in shortterm interest rates in bps march december flat na the net interest income simulation model is the primary tool utilized to evaluate potential interest rate risks over a shorterterm time horizon synovus also evaluates potential longerterm interest rate risk through modeling and evaluation of eve simulation modeling is utilized to measure the eve and its sensitivity to immediate changes in interest rates this eve modeling allows synovus to capture longerterm repricing risk and options risk embedded in the balance sheet these simulations value only the current balance sheet and do not incorporate growth assumptions used in the net interest income simulation the eve is the net fair value of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet financial instruments derived from the present value of future cash flows discounted at current market interest rates from this baseline valuation synovus evaluates changes in the value of each of these items in various interest rate scenarios to determine the net impact on the eve key assumptions utilized in the model namely loan prepayments investment security prepayments deposit repricing betas and nonmaturity deposit duration have a significant impact on the results of the eve simulations libor in july the financial conduct authority fca which regulates libor announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after confirming the continuation of libor will not be guaranteed beyond that date however due to the covid19 pandemic the fca has since softened its stance on the precessation end dates scheduled in and early on the issuance of instruments tied to libor the arrc has proposed sofr as its preferred rate as an alternative to libor and has proposed a paced market transition plan to sofr from libor the arrc recently recommended a spread adjustment methodology for cash products based on a historical median over a fiveyear lookback period calculating the difference between libor and sofr organizations are currently working on industrywide and companyspecific transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to libor as noted within our 10k risk factors synovus holds instruments that may be impacted by the discontinuance of libor including floating rate obligations loans deposits derivatives and hedges and other financial instruments but is not able to currently predict the associated financial impacts of the transition to an alternative reference rate synovus has established a crossfunctional libor transition working group that is in the process of i assessing the companys current exposure to libor indexed instruments and the data systems and processes that may also be impacted ii establishing an implementation plan and iii developing a formal governance structure for the transition critical accounting policies the accounting and financial reporting policies of synovus are in accordance with gaap and conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities synovus has identified certain of its accounting policies as critical accounting policies consisting of those related to the allowance for loan losses fair value measurements and income taxes in determining which accounting policies are critical in nature synovus has identified the policies that require significant judgment or involve complex estimates it is managements practice to discuss critical accounting policies with the board of directors audit committee including the development selection implementation and disclosure of the critical accounting policies the application of these policies has a significant impact on synovus unaudited interim consolidated financial statements synovus financial results could differ significantly if different judgments or estimates are used in the application of these policies all accounting policies described in part ii item financial statements and supplementary data note summary of significant accounting policies in synovus form 10k should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial perform ance excluding the adoption of asu financial instrumentscredit losses cecl on january as disclosed in part i item financial statements and supplementary data note basis of presentation and accounting policies in this report there have been no significant changes to the accounting policies estimates and assumptions or the judgments affecting the application of these estimates and assumptions from those disclosed in synovus form 10k nongaap financial measures the measures entitled adjusted noninterest revenue adjusted noninterest expense adjusted total revenues adjusted tangible efficiency ratio adjusted net income per common share diluted adjusted return on average assets adjusted return on average common equity adjusted return on average tangible common equity and tangible common equity ratio are not measures recognized under gaap and therefore are considered nongaap financial measures the most comparable gaap measures to these measures are total noninterest revenue total noninterest expense total revenues efficiency ratiofte net income per common share diluted return on average assets return on average common equity and the ratio of total shareholders equity to total assets respectively management believes that these nongaap financial measures provide meaningful additional information about synovus to assist management and investors in evaluating synovus operating results financial strength the performance of its business and the strength of its capital position however these nongaap financial measures have inherent limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of operating results or capital position as reported under gaap the nongaap financial measures should be considered as additional views of the way our financial measures are affected by significant items and other factors and since they are not required to be uniformly applied they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures at other companies adjusted total revenues and adjusted noninterest revenue are measures used by management to evaluate noninterest revenue exclusive of net investment securities gains and changes in fair value of private equity investments net adjusted noninterest expense and the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio are measures utilized by management to measure the success of expense management initiatives focused on reducing recurring controllable operating costs adjusted net income per common share diluted adjusted return on average assets and adjusted return on average common equity are measurements used by management to evaluate operating results exclusive of items that management believes are not indicative of ongoing operations and impact periodtoperiod comparisons adjusted return on average tangible common equity is a measure used by management to compare synovus performance with other financial institutions because it calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization thereby allowing management to evaluate the performance of the business consistently the tangible common equity ratio is used by management to assess the strength of our capital position the computations of these measures are set forth in the tables below table reconciliation of nongaap financial measures three
