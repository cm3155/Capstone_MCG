synovus adoption of cecl see part i item financial statements and supplementary data note basis of presentation and accounting policies in this report dividends synovus has historically paid a quarterly cash dividend to the holders of its common stock management and the board of directors closely monitor current and projected capital levels liquidity including div idends from subsidiaries financial markets and other economic trends as well as regulatory requirements regarding the payment of dividends as synovus navigates through the current recession and regulatory guidelines the approach to common stock dividends will be continually evaluated based on an assessment of longterm earnings capital projections and liquidity synovus ability to pay dividends on its common stock and preferred stock is primarily dependent upon dividends and distributions that it receives from its bank and nonbanking subsidiar ies which are restricted by various regulations administered by federal and state bank regulatory authorities synovus declared common stock dividends of million or per common share for the nine months ended september up from million or per common share for the nine months ended september respectively in addition synovus declared dividends on its preferred stock of million and million during the nine months ended september and respectively liquidity liquidity represents the extent to which synovus has readily available sources of funding to meet the needs of depositors borrowers and creditors to support asset growth and to otherwise sustain operations of synovus and its subsidiaries at a reasonable cost on a timely basis and without adverse consequences alco monitors synovus economic competitive and regulatory environment and is responsible for measuring monitoring and reporting on liquidity and funding risk as well as market risk in accordance with synovus policies and regulatory guidance alco evaluates contractual and anticipated cash flows under normal and stressed conditions to properly manage the companys liquidity profile synovus places an emphasis on maintaining numerous sources of current and contingent liquidity to meet its obligations to depositors borrowers and creditors on a timely basis liquidity is generated through various sources including but not limited to maturities and repayments of loans by customers maturities and sales of investment securities and growth in core or wholesale deposits management continuously monitors and maintains appropriate levels of liquidity so as to provide adequate funding sources to manage customer deposit withdrawals loan requests and other funding demands synovus bank also generates liquidity through the issuance of brokered certificates of deposit and money market accounts synovus bank accesses these funds from a broad geographic base to diversify its sources of fu nding and liquidity synovus bank also has t he capacity to access funding through its membership in the fhlb system and through the federal reserve discount window during the first quarter of synovus increased its fhlb availability by over billion through expanding pledged collateral at september based on currently pledged collateral synovus bank had access to incremental fhlb funding of billion subject to fhlb credit policies in addition to bank level liquidity management synovus must manage liquidity at the parent company level for various operating needs including the servicing of debt the payment of dividends on our common stock and preferred stock share repurchases payment of general corporate expenses and potential capital infusions into subsidiaries the primary source of liquidity for synovus consists of dividends from synovus bank which is governed by certain rules and regulations of the ga dbf and the federal reserve bank synovus ability to receive dividends from synovus bank in future periods will depend on a number of factors including without limitation synovus banks future profits asset quality liquidit y and overall condition i n addition both the ga dbf and federal reserve bank may require approval to pay dividends based on certain regulatory statutes and limitations on february synovus bank issued million aggregate principal amount of fixedtofloating rate senior bank notes due from and including the original issue date to but excluding february the notes bear interest at a fixed rate of p er annum payable semiannually in arrears on each february and august beginning on august unless redeemed from and including february to but excluding the maturity date the interest rate on the notes is computed quarterly using an interest rate based on the sofr with a daily index maturity plus a spread of bps per annum payable quarterly in arrears synovus bank may redeem the notes at its option on february which is the date that is one year prior to the maturity date upon not less than nor more than days prior notice given to holders of the notes the redemption price for any redemption is of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to but excluding the date of redemption the notes are not redeemable at the option or election of holders on february synovus terminated a million longterm fhlb obligation and incurred a million loss on early extinguishment of debt and on september synovus terminated a million longterm fhlb obligation and incurred a thousand loss on early extinguishment of debt synovus presently believes that the sources of liquidity discussed above including existing liquid funds on hand are sufficient to meet its anticipated funding needs however if economic conditions were to significantly deteriorate regulatory capital requirements for synovus or synovus bank were to increase as the result of regulatory directives or otherwise or synovus believes it is prudent to enhance current liquidity levels then synovus may seek additional liquidity from external sources see part i item risk factors the covid19 pandemic has resulted in significant market volatility and lower interest rates that could materially affect synovus results of operations and access to capital of this report and part i item risk factors changes in the cost and availability of funding due to changes in the deposit market and credit market may adversely affect our capital resources liquidity and financial results of synovus form 10k furthermore synovus may from time to time take advantage of attractive market opportunities to refinance its existing debt redeem its preferred stock or strengthen its liquidity or capital position earning assets and sources of funds average total assets for the nine months ended september increased billion or to billion as compared to billion for the first nine months of average earning assets increased billion or in the first nine months of compared to the same period in and represented of average total assets at september as compared to at september the increase in average earning assets primarily resulted from a billion or increase in average loans net which included average ppp loans of bill ion as well as a million increase in average interestbearing funds held at the federal reserve bank and a million increase in loans held for sale average interestbearing liabilities increased billion or to billion for the first nine months of compared to the same period in the increase in average interestbearing liabilities resulted from a billion or increase in average money market deposits includes an increase of million in other brokered deposits a million increase in average interestbearing demand deposits and a million increase in average longterm debt including million of senior notes issued in february these increases were partially offset by a billion or decrease in average time deposits includes an increase of millio n in brokered time deposits and a million decrease in other shortterm borrowings average noninterestbearing demand deposits increased billion or to billion for the first nine months of compared to the same period in due largely to liquidity associated with ppp lending net interest income for the nine months ended september was billion down million or compared to the same period in the decrease in yearoveryear net interest income was due to declines of million in paa primarily comprised of declines of million of loan accretion and million of deposit premium amortization associated with the fcb acquisition and declines in market interest rates which were somewhat offset by higher average earning assets net interest margin was down bps over the comparable ninemonth periods to due primarily to the decline in market interest rates in addition to declines in paa for the nine months ended september the yield on earning assets was a decrease of bps compared to the nine months ended september while the effective cost of funds decreased bps to the yield on loans decreased bps to while the yield on investment securities decreased bps to over the nine months ended september on a sequential quarter basis net interest income was up thousand and net interest margin for the third quarter was which was down bps compared to the second quarter of the sequential quarter decline in net interest margin was primarily driven by the impact of bond repositioning and student loan sales executed in the second quarter of partially offset by further declines in deposit pricing and favorable deposit remixing trends the third quarter included average ppp loan balances of billion versus billion in the second quarter and million in accretion of associated ppp processing fees versus million in the second quarter for the third quarter of the yield on earning assets decreased bps while the effective cost of funds decreased bps compared to the second quarter of we continue to expect modest downward pressure on nim as the repricing within our fixedrate asset portfolios is partially offset by continued declines in overall deposit costs excluding the potential impacts from ppp forgiveness we expect net interest income and net interest margin to decrease modestly in the fourth quarter of as compared to the

margin is calculated by dividing annualized net interest income fte by average total interest earnings assets market risk analysis interest rate risk is the primary market risk to which synovus is potentially exposed synovus measures its sensitivity to changes in market interest rates through the use of a simulation model which incorporates all of synovus earning assets and liabilities these simulations are used to determine a baseline net interest income projection and the sensitivity of the income profile based on changes in interest rates these simula tions incorporate assumptions and factors including but not limited to changes in market rates in the size or composition of the balance sheet and in repricing characteris tics as well as customer behaviors this process is reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis in a manner consistent with synovus alco governance framework synovus has modeled its baseline net interest income projection assuming a flat interest rate environment with the federal funds rate at the federal reserves current targeted range of to and the current prime rate of synovus has modeled the impact of a gradual increase in market interest rates across the yield curve of and bps and a gradual decline of bps to determine the sensitivity of net interest income for the next twelve months the lesser decline of the downrate scenario presented was selected in light of the low absolute level of monetary policy rates and generally incorporates an assumption that rates are floored at the zerolowerbound synovus current rate risk position is considered assetsensitive and would be expected to benefit net interest income in a rising interest rate environment and reduce net interest income in a declining interest rate environment the following table represents the estimated sensitivity of net interest income at september with comparable information for december table twelve month net interest income sensitivity estimated change in net interest income as compared to unchanged rates for the next twelve months change in shortterm interest rates in bps september december flat na the net interest income simulation model is the primary tool utilized to evaluate potential interest rate risks over a shorterterm time horizon synovus also evaluates potential longerterm interest rate risk through modeling and evaluation of the sensitivity of the companys economic value of equity eve the eve measurement process estimates the net fair value of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet financial instruments under various interest rate scenarios management uses eve sensitivity analyses as an additional means of measuring interest rate risk and incorporates this form of analysis within its governance and limits framework libor in july the financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after confirming the continuation of libor will not be guaranteed beyond that date however due to the covid19 pandemic the fca has since softened its stance on the precessation end dates scheduled in and early on the issuance of instruments tied to libor the arrc has proposed sofr as its preferred rate as an alternative to libor and has proposed a paced market transition plan to sofr from libor the isda recently recommended a spread adjustment methodology for derivative products based on historical differences between libor and sofr organizations are currently working on industrywide and companyspecific transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to libor as noted within our 10k risk factors synovus holds instruments that may be impacted by the discontinuance of libor including floating rate obligations loans deposits derivatives and hedges and other financial instruments but is not able to currently predict the associated financial impacts of the transition to an alternative reference rate synovus has established a crossfunctional libor transition working group that is in the process of i assessing the companys current exposure to libor indexed instruments and the data systems and processes that may also be impacted ii establishing an implementation plan and iii developing a formal governance structure for the transition critical accounting policies the accounting and financial reporting policies of synovus are in accordance with gaap and conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities synovus has identified certain of its accounting policies as critical accounting policies consisting of those related to the allowance for loan losses fair value measurements and income taxes in determining which accounting policies are critical in nature synovus has identified the policies that require significant judgment or involve complex estimates it is managements practice to discuss critical accounting policies with the board of directors audit committee including the development selection implementation and disclosure of the critical accounting policies the application of these policies has a significant impact on synovus unaudited interim consolidated financial statements synovus financial results could differ significantly if different judgments or estimates are used in the application of these policies all accounting policies described in part ii item financial statements and supplementary data note summary of significant accounting policies in synovus form 10k should be reviewed

adjusted total revenues adjusted tangible efficiency ratio adjusted net income per common share diluted adjusted return on average assets adjusted return on average common equity return on average tangible common equity adjusted return on average tangible common equity and tangible common equity ratio are not measures recognized under gaap and therefore are considered nongaap financial measures the most comparable gaap measures to these measures are total noninterest revenue total noninterest expense total revenues efficiency ratiofte net income per common share diluted return on average assets return on average common equity and the ratio of total shareholders equity to total assets respectively management believes that these nongaap financial measures provide meaningful additional information about synovus to assist management and investors in evaluating synovus operating results financial strength the performance of its business and the strength of its capital position however these nongaap financial measures have inherent limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of operating results or capital position as reported under gaap the nongaap financial measures should be considered as additional views of the way our financial measures are affected by significant items and other factors and since they are not required to be uniformly applied they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures at other companies adjusted total revenues and adjusted noninterest revenue are measures used by management to evaluate noninterest revenue exclusive of net investment securities gains losses and gains on sale and changes in fair value of private equity investments net adjusted noninterest expense and the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio are measures utilized by management to measure the success of expense management initiatives focused on reducing recurring controllable operating costs adjusted net income per common share diluted adjusted return on average assets and adjusted return on average common equity are measurements used by management to evaluate operating results exclusive of items that management believes are not indicative of ongoing operations and impact periodtoperiod comparisons return on average tangible common equity and adjusted return on average tangible common equity are measures used by management to compare synovus performance with other financial institutions because it calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization thereby allowing management to evaluate the performance of the business consistently the tangible common equity ratio is used by management
