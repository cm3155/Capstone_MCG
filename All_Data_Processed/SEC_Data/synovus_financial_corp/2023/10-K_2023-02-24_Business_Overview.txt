fintech continues to increase and accelerate with consumers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives the ability of such nonbanking financial institutions to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has intensified competition because nonbanking financial institutions are not subject to many of the same regulatory restrictions as banks and bank holding companies they can often operate with greater flexibility and lower cost structures these competitors have been successful in developing products that are in direct competition with or are alternatives to the banking services offered by traditional banking institutions our ability to deliver strong financial performance will depend in part on our ability

certain circumstances these agencies may enforce these remedies directly against officers directors employees and other parties participating in the affairs of a bank or bank holding company like all bank holding companies we are regulated extensively under federal and state law under federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to the safety and soundness of insured depository institutions state banking regulators the federal reserve and separately the fdic as the insurer of bank deposits have the authority to compel or restrict certain actions on our part if they determine that we have insufficient capital or other resources or are otherwise operating in a manner that may be deemed to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices under this authority our regulators can require us or our subsidiaries to enter into informal or formal supervisory agreements including board resolutions memoranda of understanding written agreements and consent or cease and desist orders pursuant to which we would be required to take identified corrective actions to address cited concerns and to refrain from taking certain actions if we become subject to and are unable to comply with

holding company that has not elected to be a financial holding company bank holding companies are generally restricted to engaging in the business of banking managing or controlling banks and certain other activities determined by the federal reserve to be closely related to banking financial holding companies may also engage in activities that are considered to be financial in nature as well as those incidental or if determined by the federal reserve complementary to financial activities if synovus bank ceases to be well capitalized or well managed under applicable regulatory standards or if synovus bank receives a rating of less than satisfactory under the cra the federal reserve may among other things place limitations on our ability to conduct these broader financial activities or if the deficiencies persist require us to divest the banking subsidiary or the businesses engaged in activities permissible only for financial holding companies in addition the federal reserve has the power to order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any nonbanking activity or terminate its ownership or control of any nonbank subsidiary when it has reasonable cause to believe that continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety soundness or stability of any bank subsidiary of that bank holding company as further described below each of the company and synovus bank is wellcapitalized under applicable regulatory standards as of december and synovus bank has an overall rating of satisfactory in its most recent cra evaluation source of strength obligations a bank holding company such as us is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank the term source of financial strength means the ability of a company such as us that directly or indirectly owns or controls an insured depository institution such as synovus bank to provide financial assistance to such insured depository institution in the event of financial distress the appropriate federal banking agency for the depository institution in the case of synovus bank this agency is the federal reserve may require reports from us to assess our ability to serve as a source of strength and to enforce compliance with the source of strength requirements by requiring us to provide financial assistance to synovus bank in the event of financial distress if we were to enter bankruptcy or become subject to the orderly liquidation process established by the doddfrank act any commitment by us to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of synovus bank would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee or the fdic as appropriate and entitled to a priority of payment in addition the fdic provides that any insured depository institution generally will be liable for any loss incurred by the fdic in connection with the default of or any assistance provided by the fdic to a commonly controlled insured depository institution synovus bank is an fdicinsured depository institution and thus subject to these requirements acquisitions the bhc act permits acquisitions of banks by bank holding companies such that we and any other bank holding company whether located in georgia or elsewhere may acquire a bank located in any other state subject to certain depositpercentage age of bank charter requirements and other restrictions the bhc act requires that a bank holding company obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve before i acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the voting shares of any additional bank or bank holding company ii taking any action that causes an additional bank or bank holding company to become a subsidiary of the bank holding company or iii merging or consolidating with any other bank holding company the federal reserve may not approve any such transaction that would result in a monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any section of the united states or the effect of which may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly in any section of the country or that in any other manner would be in restraint of trade unless the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served the federal reserve is also required to consider i the financial and managerial resources of the companies involved including pro forma capital ratios ii the risk to the stability of the united states banking or financial system iii the convenience and needs of the communities to be served including performance under the cra and iv the effectiveness of the company in combatting money laundering change in control federal law restricts the amount of voting stock of a bank holding company or a bank that a person may acquire without the prior approval of banking regulators under the change in bank control act and the regulations thereunder a person or group must give advance notice to the federal reserve before acquiring control of any bank holding company such as the company or before acquiring control of any fdicinsured bank such as synovus bank upon receipt of such notice the federal reserve may approve or disapprove the acquisition the change in bank control act creates a rebuttable presumption of control if a person or group acquires the power to vote or more of our outstanding common stock the overall effect of such laws is to make it more difficult to acquire a bank holding company and a bank by tender offer or similar means than it might be to acquire control of another type of corporation consequently shareholders of the company may be less likely to benefit from the rapid increases in stock prices that may result from tender offers or similar efforts to acquire control of other companies investors should be aware of these requirements when acquiring shares of our stock governance and financial reporting obligations we are

concentrations exceed either total reported loans for construction land development and other land of or more of a banks total riskbased capital or total reported loans secured by multifamily and nonfarm nonresidential properties and loans for construction land development and other land of or more of a banks total riskbased capital the guidance also applies when a bank has a sharp increase in cre loans or has significant concentrations of cre secured by a particular property type we have always had exposures to loans secured by cre due to the nature of our markets and the borrowing needs of both consumer and commercial clients we believe our longterm experience in cre lending underwriting policies internal controls and other policies currently in place as well as our loan and credit monitoring and administration procedures are generally appropriate in managing our concentrations as required under the guidance debit interchange fees interchange fees or swipe fees are fees that

federal banking agencies issued a new rule effective in that requires banks to notify their primary federal regulator within hours of a computersecurity incident that rises to the level of a notification incident the federal banking regulators regularly issue guidance regarding cybersecurity intended to enhance cyber risk management standards among financial institutions as a result financial institutions like synovus and synovus bank are expected to establish multiple lines of defense and to ensure their risk management processes address the risk posed by potential threats to the institution a financial institutions management is expected to maintain sufficient processes to effectively respond and recover the institutions operations after a cyberattack a financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations if a critical service provider of the institution falls victim to this type of cyberattack our information security protocols are designed in part to adhere to the requirements of this guidance state regulators have also been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations recently several states have adopted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and providing detailed requirements with respect to these programs including data encryption requirements many states have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification and data privacy requirements
