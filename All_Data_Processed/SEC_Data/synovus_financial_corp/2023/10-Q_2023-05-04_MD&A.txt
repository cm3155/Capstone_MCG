more than sufficient to meet what continued to be solid core balance sheet growth for additional information on regulatory capital requirements see part ii item financial statements and supplementary data note regulatory capital to the consolidated financial statements of synovus form 10k management reviews the companys capital position on an ongoing basis and believes based on internal capital analyses and earnings projections that synovus is well positioned to meet relevant regulatory capital standards on january synovus announced that its board of directors approved a capital plan that included a increase in the quarterly common stock dividend to per share beginning with the quarterly dividend payable in april and authorized share repurchases of up to million in synovus did not repurchase any shares in the first quarter of and in light of the uncertain economic and regulatory environment in the nearterm we will continue to focus on retaining and growing capital on august the federal banking regulators issued a final rule that allowed electing banking organizations that adopted cecl during to mitigate the estimated effects of cecl on regulatory capital for two years followed by a threeyear phasein transition period synovus adopted cecl on january and the march regulatory capital ratios reflect synovus election of the fiveyear transition provision at march million or a cumulative bps benefit to cet1 was deferred dividends synovus has historically paid a quarterly cash dividend to the holders of its common stock management and the board of directors closely monitor current and projected capital levels liquidity including dividends from subsidiaries financial markets and other economic trends as well as regulatory requirements regarding the payment of dividends synovus ability to pay dividends on its common stock and preferred stock is primarily dependent upon dividends and distributions that it receives from its bank and nonbanking subsidiaries which are restricted by various regulations administered by federal and state bank regulatory authorities synovus declared common stock dividends of million or per common share for the three months ended march compared to million or per common share for the three months ended march in addition synovus declared dividends on its preferred stock of million during both the three months ended march and liquidity liquidity represents the extent to which synovus has readily available sources of funding to meet the needs of depositors borrowers and creditors to support asset growth and to otherwise sustain operations of synovus and its subsidiaries at a reasonable cost on a timely basis and without adverse consequences alco monitors synovus economic competitive and regulatory environment and is responsible for measuring monitoring and reporting on liquidity and funding risk as well as market risk in accordance with synovus policies and regulatory guidance alco evaluates contractual and anticipated cash flows under normal and stressed conditions to properly manage the companys liquidity profile synovus places an emphasis on maintaining numerous sources of current and contingent liquidity to meet its obligations to depositors borrowers and creditors on a timely basis liquidity is generated through various sources including but not limited to maturities and repayments of loans by clients maturities and sales of investment securities and growth in core and wholesale deposits synovus bank also generates liquidity through the issuance of brokered certificates of deposit and money market accounts synovus bank accesses funds from a broad geographic base to diversify its sources of funding and liquidity synovus bank also has the capacity to access funding through its membership in the fhlb system and through the federal reserve discount window management continuously monitors and maintains appropriate levels of liquidity so as to provide adequate funding sources to manage client deposit withdrawals loan requests and other funding demands synovus maintained stable core deposit balances growing by million during the first quarter of time deposits increased billion partially offset by a million decline in money market accounts as consumers shifted excess liquidity between these two account types a million decrease in noninterest bearing demand deposits was primarily impacted by commercial seasonality normal cash deployment and to a lesser extent continued pressures from the fomcs efforts to tighten monetary policy based on certain recent bank failures and negative media narrative around deposit outflows at regional banks synovus proactively added fhlb advances and brokered deposits as precautionary measures amid the uncertain environment synovus continues to proactively pledge additional collateral to the fhlb and federal reserve and maintains contingent liquidity across a diverse set of sources which include immediately available funds as well as funds we expect to be available within short notice contingent liquidity sources include primary sources such as fhlb borrowing capacity frb cash reserves and thirdparty consumer loans which includes our decision to sell loans from this portfolio and runoff while secondary sources consist of the federal reserve discount window fed funds lines and other sources like the frbs bank term funding program at march based on currently pledged collateral synovus bank had access to fhlb funding of billion subject to fhlb credit policies in addition to bank level liquidity management synovus must manage liquidity at the parent company level for various operating needs including the servicing of debt the payment of dividends on our common stock and preferred stock payment of general corporate expense and potential capital infusions into subsidiaries the primary source of liquidity for synovus consists of dividends from synovus bank which is governed by certain rules and regulations of the ga dbf and the federal reserve bank synovus ability to receive dividends from synovus bank in future periods will depend on a number of factors including without limitation synovus banks future profits asset quality liquidity and overall condition in addition both the ga dbf and federal reserve bank may require approval to pay dividends based on certain regulatory statutes and limitations on february synovus bank issued million aggregate principal amount of senior bank notes due and the notes will mature on february the notes will bear interest at per annum payable semiannually in arrears on each february and august beginning on august synovus bank may not redeem the notes prior to august the redemption price for any redemption in whole or in part at our option on or after august and prior to january is equal to the greater of a the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the redemption date assuming the notes matured on january on a semiannual basis assuming a 360day year consisting of twelve 30day months at the treasury rate plus basis points less b interest accrued to the date of redemption and of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed plus in either case accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date the redemption price for any redemption after january is of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date the notes are not redeemable at the option or election of holders synovus presently believes that the sources of liquidity discussed above including existing liquid funds on hand are sufficient to meet its anticipated funding needs see part ii item risk factors recent negative developments in the banking industry could adversely affect our current and projected business operations and our financial condition and results of operation of this report and part i item risk factors changes in the cost and availability of funding due to changes in the deposit market and credit market may adversely affect our capital resources liquidity and financial results of synovus form 10k furthermore synovus may from time to time take advantage of attractive market opportunities to refinance its existing debt redeem its preferred stock or strengthen its liquidity or capital position earning assets and sources of funds average total assets for the three months ended march increased billion or as compared to the first three months of average earning assets increased billion or in the first three months of compared to the same period in the increase in average earning assets primarily resulted from a billion or increase in average total loans net of unearned income primarily attributable to growth in commercial loans from increased production and line utilization average interestbearing liabilities increased billion or for the first three months of compared to the same period in the increase in average interestbearing liabilities largely resulted from a billion increase in brokered deposits a billion increase in longterm debt a billion increase in other shortterm borrowings and a million increase in time deposits partially offset by a billion decrease in money market accounts the increase in brokered deposits longterm debt and other shortterm borrowings from fhlb advances was largely due to the ongoing management of our liquidity position which also included the february issuance of million par value synovus bank senior notes the increase in time deposits and decreased money market accounts were correlated as consumers have shifted excess liquidity between these two account types average noninterestbearing deposits decreased billion or for the first three months of compared to the same period in primarily due to the continued pressures from the fomcs efforts to tighten monetary policy and normal client liquidity deployment net interest income for the three months ended march was million up million or compared to the same period in net interest margin was up bps over the comparable three month period to due primarily to the benefits of our asset sensitive balance sheet and substantial loan growth partially offset by continued increases in deposit costs on a sequential quarter basis net interest income was down million or impacted by a lower day count and higher deposit costs net interest margin for the first quarter was down bps compared to the fourth quarter of as the asset side of our balance sheet continued to benefit from higher balances and rates but cyclical lags in deposit pricing combined with remixing within our noninterest bearing deposits served as a notable headwind for the current quarter in addition we proactively added fhlb advances and brokered deposits amid the uncertain economic environment and issued the aforementioned million bank senior notes we expect net interest income to be pressured in the near term specifically we will see a full quarter impact of the deposit mixshift that occurred during the first quarter of as well as the continued headwind resulting from deposit price lags the combination of these headwinds is expected to lead to net interest income declines in the second quarter of followed by relative stability for the remainder of the year consistent with our full year guidance net interest income and ratevolume analysis the following tables set forth the major components of net interest income and the related annualized yields and rates for the three months ended march and as well as the variances between the periods caused by changes in interest rates versus changes in volume table quartertodate net interest income and

interest earnings assets net interest margin reflects actualactual day count and includes other immaterial adjustments versus nim previously reported market risk analysis interest rate risk is the primary market risk to which synovus is potentially exposed synovus measures the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates through the use of simulation modeling which incorporates all of synovus earning assets and liabilities these simulations are used to determine a baseline net interest income projection and the sensitivity of the income profile based on changes in interest rates these simulations incorporate assumptions and factors including but not limited to changes in market rates in the size or composition of the balance sheet and in repricing characteristics as well as client behaviors this includes estimates for deposit repricing characteristics which for purposes of the sensitivity estimates provided below relies upon a constant throughthecycle total deposit cost beta of approximately as of the most recently reported period this process is reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis in a manner consistent with synovus alco governance framework synovus has modeled its baseline net interest income forecast assuming a relatively flat interest rate environment with the federal funds rate at the federal reserves targeted range of to as of march and the prime rate of as of march synovus has modeled the impact of an immediate change in market interest rates across the yield curve of and bps to determine the sensitivity of net interest income for the next twelve months as illustrated in the table below the net interest income sensitivity derived from this simulation suggests that net interest income is projected to increase by and if interest rates increased by and bps respectively net interest income is projected to decrease by and if interest rates decreased by and bps respectively the following table represents the estimated sensitivity of net interest income at march with comparable information for december table twelve month net interest income sensitivity estimated change in net interest income as compared to unchanged rates for the next twelve months change in interest rates in bps march december while all of the above estimates are reflective of the general interest rate sensitivity of synovus local market conditions the realized growth and remixing of the balance sheet as well as the broader macroeconomic environment could all have a significant impact on the both the sensitivity and realized level of net interest income the net interest income simulation model is the primary tool utilized to evaluate potential interest rate risks over a shorterterm time horizon synovus also evaluates potential longerterm interest rate risk through modeling and evaluation of the sensitivity of the companys eve the eve measurement process estimates the net fair value of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet financial instruments under various interest rate scenarios management uses eve sensitivity analyses as an additional means of measuring interest rate risk and incorporates this form of analysis within its governance and limits framework the results of these analyses were consistent with the impact of the interest rate sensitivity analysis as shown in table twelve month net interest income sensitivity above synovus is also subject to market risk in certain of its fee income business lines financial management services revenue which include trust brokerage and asset management fees can be affected by risk in the securities markets primarily the equity securities market a significant portion of the fees in this unit are determined based upon a percentage of asset values weaker securities markets and lower equity values have an adverse impact on the fees generated by these operations trading account assets maintained to facilitate brokerage client activity are also subject to market risk however trading activities are limited and subject to risk policy limits additionally synovus utilizes various tools to measure and manage price risk in its trading portfolio mortgage banking income is also subject to market risk mortgage loan originations are sensitive to levels of mortgage interest rates and therefore mortgage banking income can be negatively impacted during a period of rising interest rates as we have experienced in the past year the extension of commitments to clients to fund mortgage loans also subjects synovus to market risk this risk is primarily created by the time periods between making the commitment closing and delivering the loan synovus seeks to minimize its exposure by utilizing various risk management tools including forward sales commitments and other hedges derivative instruments for interest rate risk management synovus utilizes derivative instruments to manage its exposure to various types of structural interest rate risks by executing enduser derivative transactions designated as hedges hedging relationships may be designated as either a cash flow hedge which mitigates risk exposure to the variability of future cash flows or other forecasted transactions or a fair value hedge which mitigates risk exposure to adverse changes in the fair market value of a fixed rate asset or liability due to changes in market interest rates as of march and december synovus had billion and billion respectively in notional amounts outstanding of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedging instruments to hedge its exposure to contractually specified interest rate risk associated with floating rate loans as of march and december synovus had billion and billion respectively in notional amounts outstanding of receivefixed payvariable interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedging instruments to hedge its exposure to the change in the fair value due to fluctuations in market interest rates for outstanding fixedrate longterm debt and interestbearing deposits libor transition on march the fca confirmed that all libor settings would either cease to be provided by any administrator or would no longer be representative immediately after june for all remaining us dollar settings the arrc proposed sofr as its preferred rate alternative to libor and proposed a paced market transition plan to sofr from libor organizations are currently working on industrywide and companyspecific transition plans related to derivatives and cash markets exposed to libor as noted within part i item risk factors of synovus form 10k synovus holds instruments that may be impacted by the discontinuance of libor which include floating rate obligations loans deposits derivatives and hedges and other financial instruments synovus established a crossfunctional libor transition working group with representation from all business lines support and control functions and legal counsel that has assessed the companys current exposure to libor indexed instruments and the data systems and processes that were impacted and have been changed as a result established a detailed implementation plan formulated communications and learning activities to support clients and colleagues and developed a formal governance structure for the transition for the last several years loan agreement provisions for new and renewed loans included libor fallback language to ensure transition from libor when such transition occurs all direct exposures resulting from existing financial contracts that mature after have been inventoried and are monitored on an ongoing basis the company discontinued the use of libor as of december with limited exceptions as permitted by regulatory guidance or internal policies synovus has expanded its product offerings and currently offers multiple alternative reference rates to clients including sofr bsby and prime indices as of march the company had approximately billion in loans tied to libor that mature after june remediation activities are underway to modify or transition existing exposures to the applicable federal reserve board selected replacement rate or to convert the rate under existing fallback language including the use of the adjustable interest libor act enacted in march and other relevant legislation critical accounting policies the accounting and financial reporting policies of synovus are in accordance with gaap and conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities synovus has identified certain of its accounting policies as critical accounting policies consisting of those related to the allowance for credit losses and income taxes in determining which accounting policies are critical in nature synovus has identified the policies that require significant judgment or involve complex estimates it is managements practice to discuss critical accounting policies with the board of directors audit committee on a periodic basis including the development selection implementation and disclosure of the critical accounting policies the application of these policies has a significant impact on synovus unaudited interim consolidated financial statements synovus financial results could differ significantly if different judgments or estimates are used in the application of these policies all accounting policies described in part ii item financial statements and supplementary data note summary of significant accounting policies in synovus form 10k should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance there have been no significant changes to the accounting policies estimates and
