item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary the following financial review provides a discussion of synovus financial condition changes in financial condition and results of operations as well as a summary of synovus critical accounting policies this section should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in part ii item financial statements and supplementary data of this report economic environment and recent events many of the key economic drivers of inflation economic uncertainty geopolitical pressures and changes in monetary policy among others continued in with the added challenges resulting from the bank failures in the first half of the year and the resulting and pervasive pressures on and volatility in the banking industry as a whole inflation remained a key economic concern in prompting the federal reserve to continue to tighten monetary policy by continuing to raise market interest rates by bps in while interest rate cuts are now expected in as indicated by market forward interest rates the specific timing of these cuts is uncertain as fomc policy rate decisions are highly dependent on the level of inflation and strength of the labor market outside of inflation the economic uncertainty and market disruptions of remain in including geopolitical tensions from conflict in the middle east russias prolonged war in ukraine and the strained relationship between the us and china moreover is an election year and there are specific risks and uncertainties related to the election and any change in administration that could impact the economy and fiscal and regulatory policy by varying degrees multiple mixed signals make navigating the way ahead difficult as evidenced by the volatility in capital markets variance in interpretation of the feds messaging and wide ranges of multiple economic outlooks us fiscal policy has been expansionary in recent years leaving a significant federal deficit which will most likely continue to grow exacerbated in the near term by the election cycle the inflation reduction act signed into law in august raised federal revenue by imposing an alternative corporate minimum tax if certain thresholds are met and a nondeductible excise tax on corporate share repurchases the regional bank failures in march and may of and the subsequent response by both the banking industry and the federal reserve served to mitigate the risks of such failures becoming more systemic however the residual impacts on the banking industry and the broader economic environment remain uncertain and have generally presented a more challenging outlook for the banking industry and for synovus these bank failures resulted in a fdic special assessment increased regulatory scrutiny expectations for future regulatory changes and continued pressure on deposits and liquidity despite the headwinds discussed above we believe our presence in strong southeastern us growth markets positions synovus to execute on our guidance outlined below by making prudent decisions around business mix balance sheet

fees and costs of billion declined million or from december growth in ci loans has been diversified but somewhat offset by a strategic decline in nonrelationship credits the decline in cre loans was impacted by the billion medical office buildings loans sale excluding that strategic sale cre growth was driven by draws on existing commitments and lower levels of paydown and payoff activity the

reporting policies of synovus are in accordance with gaap and conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities synovus has identified certain of its accounting policies as critical accounting policies consisting of those related to the accounting for the allowance for credit losses and income taxes in determining which accounting policies are critical in nature synovus has identified the policies that require significant judgment or involve complex estimates it is managements practice to discuss critical accounting policies with the board of directors audit committee on a periodic basis including the development selection implementation and disclosure of the critical accounting policies the application of these policies has a significant impact on synovus consolidated financial statements synovus financial results could differ significantly if different judgments or estimates are applied in the application of these policies allowance for credit losses the acl is a critical accounting estimate that requires significant judgments and assumptions which are inherently subjective the use of different estimates or assumptions could have a significant impact on the provision for credit losses acl financial condition and results of operations the economic and business climate in any given industry or market is difficult to gauge and can change rapidly and the effects of those changes can vary by borrower in accordance with cecl the acl which includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments represents managements best estimate of expected losses over the life of loans adjusted for prepayments and over the life of loan commitments expected to fund synovus loans and unfunded loan commitments are grouped based upon the nature of the loan type and the forecasted pd adjusted for relevant forecasted macroeconomic factors comprising multiple weighted scenarios representing different plausible outcomes and lgd to determine the allowance for the majority of our portfolio to the extent the estimated lives of the loans in the portfolio extend beyond the period for which a reasonable and supportable forecast can be made which is two years for synovus the company reverts on a straightline basis back to the historical rates over a oneyear period lifeofloan loss percentages may also be adjusted as necessary for certain quantitative and qualitative factors that in managements judgment are necessary to reflect losses expected in the portfolio these adjustments address inherent limitations in the quantitative model loans that do not share risk characteristics are individually evaluated on a loanbyloan basis with specific reserves if any recorded as appropriate given the dynamic relationship between macroeconomic variables within an economic forecast it is difficult to estimate the impact of a change in any one individual variable on the acl as a result when formulating the quantitative estimate management uses a probabilityweighted approach that incorporates a baseline forecast an upside scenario reflecting an accelerated recovery a downside scenario that reflects adverse economic conditions and a scenario that assumes consistent slow growth that is less optimistic than the baseline to illustrate a hypothetical sensitivity analysis management calculated an acl using the upside and downside scenarios our quantitative cecl model is most sensitive to the unemployment rate which peaks near in the downside scenario and in the upside scenario this is compared to the multiscenario forecasts weighted average peak of around this downside scenario assumes a severe deterioration in economic conditions compared to our baseline forecast including low consumer confidence a recession starting in the first quarter of and persistent inflation pressures which cause the fed to keep interest rates elevated the upside scenario assumes a stronger economy compared to our baseline forecast driven by favorable business sentiment consumer confidence and spending and higher gdp excluding the impact of qualitative considerations using only the upside forecast scenario would result in an estimated million decrease while using only the downside forecast scenario would result in an estimated increase of million compared to the reported acl of million at december therefore the resulting hypothetical range of estimates is between million and million the sensitivity analysis result does not represent managements view of expected credit losses nor is it intended to estimate future changes in acl levels for reasons including but not limited to the following management uses a weighted approach applied to multiple economic scenarios for its acl estimation process the impact of changes in economic variables are interrelated and nonlinear therefore the results of the analysis cannot be extrapolated to additional changes in economic variables subsequent changes in the mix of portfolio characteristics could materially impact results potential future government or regulatory intervention could cause results to differ materially from historical relationships between the economic variables and related credit metrics and the sensitivity analysis does not account for any quantitative or qualitative adjustments incorporated by management as part of its overall acl framework to reflect losses expected in the portfolio see part ii item financial statements and supplementary data note summary of significant accounting policies and part ii item financial statements and supplementary data note loans and allowance for loan losses in this report for additional details income taxes the calculation of synovus income tax provision is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments in its determination as part of synovus overall business strategy management must consider tax laws and regulations that apply to the specific facts and circumstances under consideration as such the company is often required to exercise significant judgment regarding the interpretation of these tax laws and regulations in which synovus anticipated and actual liability could significantly vary based upon the taxing authoritys interpretation specifically significant estimates in accounting for income taxes relate to the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities estimates of the realizability of deferred tax assets including income tax credits and nols and the need for a valuation allowance the calculation of taxable income the estimation of uncertain tax positions and the determination of temporary differences between book and tax bases adjustments to these items may occur due to modifications in tax rates newly enacted laws issuance of tax regulations resolution of items with taxing authorities alterations to interpretative statutory judicial and regulatory guidance that affects the companys tax positions changes in the companys tax accounting methods or elections or other facts and circumstances management closely monitors tax developments and the potential timing of these changes in order to evaluate the effect they may have on the companys overall tax position and the estimates and judgments used in determining the income tax provision and records adjustments as necessary see part ii item financial statements and supplementary data note summary of significant accounting policies and part ii item

collateral which consists primarily of equipment inventory accounts receivable time deposits cash surrender value of life insurance and other business assets at december billion of ci loans or of the total loan portfolio represented loans originated for the purpose of financing owneroccupied properties the financing of owneroccupied facilities is considered a ci loan even though there is improved real estate as collateral such as senior housing facilities this treatment is a result of the credit decision process which focuses on cash flow from operations of the business to repay the debt the secondary source of repayment on these loans is the underlying real estate these loans are predominately secured by owneroccupied and other real estate and to a lesser extent other types of collateral commercial real estate loans cre loans primarily consist of incomeproducing investment properties loans additionally cre loans include family properties loans as well as land and development loans in

objective is to manage those assets and liabilities to maximize net interest income while balancing interest rate credit liquidity and capital risks net interest margin net interest margin is a measure of the spread between interest earning assets relative to the cost of funding and can be used to assess the efficiency of earnings from balance sheet activities the net interest margin is
