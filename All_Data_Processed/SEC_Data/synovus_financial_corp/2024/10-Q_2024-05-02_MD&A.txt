within a range of to and aim to maintain a robust capital position against what remains an uncertain macroeconomic environment for additional information on regulatory capital requirements see part ii item financial statements and supplementary data note regulatory capital to the consolidated financial statements of synovus form 10k management reviews the companys capital position on an ongoing basis and believes based on internal capital analyses and earnings projections that synovus is well positioned to meet relevant regulatory capital standards the company announced on january that its board of directors authorized share repurchases of up to million of common stock and million of preferred stock in during the three months ended march synovus repurchased thousand shares of common stock at an average price of per share via open market transactions on august the federal banking regulators issued a final rule that allowed electing banking organizations that adopted cecl during to mitigate the estimated effects of cecl on regulatory capital for two years followed by a threeyear phasein transition period synovus adopted cecl on january and the march regulatory capital ratios reflect synovus election of the fiveyear transition provision at march million or a cumulative bps benefit to cet1 was deferred dividends synovus has historically paid a quarterly cash dividend to the holders of its common stock management and the board of directors closely monitor current and projected capital levels liquidity including dividends from subsidiaries financial markets and other economic trends as well as regulatory requirements regarding the payment of dividends synovus ability to pay dividends on its common stock and preferred stock is primarily dependent upon dividends and distributions that it receives from its bank and nonbanking subsidiaries which are restricted by various regulations administered by federal and state bank regulatory authorities synovus declared common stock dividends of million or per common share for the three months ended march compared to million or per common share for the three months ended march in addition synovus declared dividends on its preferred stock of million for the three months ended march compared to million for the three months ended march liquidity liquidity represents the extent to which synovus has readily available sources of funding to meet the needs of depositors borrowers and creditors to support asset growth and to otherwise sustain operations of synovus and its subsidiaries at a reasonable cost on a timely basis and without adverse consequences alco monitors synovus economic competitive and regulatory environment and is responsible for measuring monitoring and reporting on liquidity and funding risk as well as market risk in accordance with synovus policies and regulatory guidance alco evaluates contractual and anticipated cash flows under normal and stressed conditions to properly manage the companys liquidity profile synovus places an emphasis on maintaining numerous sources of current and contingent liquidity to meet its obligations to depositors borrowers and creditors on a timely basis liquidity is generated through various sources including but not limited to maturities and repayments of loans by clients maturities and sales of investment securities and growth in core and wholesale deposits synovus bank also generates liquidity through the issuance of brokered certificates of deposit and money market accounts synovus bank accesses funds from a broad geographic base to diversify its sources of funding and liquidity synovus bank also has the capacity to access funding through its membership in the fhlb system and the federal reserve management continuously monitors and maintains appropriate levels of liquidity so as to provide adequate funding sources to manage client deposit withdrawals loan requests and other funding demands total deposits at march decreased million compared to december as a million decline in brokered deposits resulting from continued proactive management of our balance sheet position was somewhat offset by a million increase in core deposits the growth in core deposits was primarily due to continued client demand for time deposits partially offset by a decline in noninterestbearing demand deposits and seasonality synovus continues to proactively manage its liquidity position which has included the level of brokered deposits and robust contingent liquidity is maintained across a diverse set of sources which include immediately available funds as well as funds we expect to be available within short notice contingent liquidity sources include primary sources such as fhlb borrowing capacity frb cash reserves unencumbered securities and thirdparty consumer loans which includes our decision to sell loans from this portfolio and strategic runoff while secondary sources consist of the federal reserve discount window fed funds lines and other sources at march contingent sources of liquidity totaled approximately billion and based on currently pledged collateral synovus bank had access to fhlb funding of billion subject to fhlb credit policies in addition to bank level liquidity management synovus must manage liquidity at the parent company level for various operating needs including the servicing of debt the payment of dividends on our common stock and preferred stock payment of general corporate expense and potential capital infusions into subsidiaries the primary source of liquidity for synovus consists of dividends from synovus bank which is governed by certain rules and regulations of the ga dbf and the federal reserve bank synovus ability to receive dividends from synovus bank in future periods will depend on a number of factors including without limitation synovus banks future profits asset quality liquidity and overall condition in addition both the ga dbf and federal reserve bank may require approval to pay dividends based on certain regulatory statutes and limitations synovus presently believes that the sources of liquidity discussed above including existing liquid funds on hand are sufficient to meet its anticipated funding needs however if economic conditions were to significantly deteriorate regulatory capital requirements for synovus or synovus bank were to increase as a result of directives or otherwise or synovus believes it is prudent to enhance current liquidity levels then synovus may seek additional liquidity from external sources see part i item risk factors market and other general risk recent negative developments affecting the banking industry and resulting media coverage have eroded client confidence in the banking system and credit and liquidity risk changes in the cost and availability of funding due to changes in the deposit market and credit market may adversely affect our capital resources liquidity and financial results of synovus form 10k furthermore synovus may from time to time take advantage of attractive market opportunities to refinance retire or repurchase its existing debt redeem its preferred stock repurchase shares or strengthen its liquidity or capital position earning assets and sources of funds average earning assets decreased billion in the first three months of compared to the same period in the decrease in average earning assets primarily resulted from an average other loans held for sale decline of million an average total loans net of unearned income decrease of million million lower average interestbearing funds held at the federal reserve bank due to an elevated cash position amidst banking industry uncertainty that began near the end of the first quarter of and a million decrease in average investment securities available for sale amortized cost basis the decline in average other loans held for sale was primarily attributable to sales of thirdparty consumer loans while the decrease in average total loans net of unearned income was largely due to a decline in thirdparty consumer loans from continued runoff and a million transfer to held for sale near the end of the first quarter of average interestbearing liabilities increased billion or for the first three months of compared to the same period in the increase in average interestbearing liabilities largely resulted from increases of billion and billion in average time deposits and average interestbearing demand deposits respectively partially offset by decreases of billion billion and billion in average other shortterm borrowings average money market accounts and average longterm debt respectively the increases in time deposits and interestbearing demand deposits and decrease in money market accounts were correlated as fluctuations between these categories have been driven by the rate environment the decreases in other shortterm borrowings and longterm debt were largely due to the ongoing management of our liquidity position average noninterestbearing demand deposits decreased billion for the first three months of compared to the same period in primarily due to the continued pressures from the rate environment and client deployment of excess funds net interest income for the three months ended march was million down million or compared to the same period in net interest margin was down bps over the comparable period to as the benefits of our asset sensitive balance sheet were offset by continued increases in funding costs and negative deposit remixing on a sequential quarter basis net interest income was down million or impacted largely by continued higher deposit costs partially offset by lower day count and benefits of available for sale investment securities repositioning in the fourth quarter of net interest margin for the first quarter of was down bps compared to the fourth quarter of as the asset side of our balance sheet continued to benefit from higher rates but the impact from higher deposit pricing combined with negative deposit remixing resulted in margin compression we expect net interest margin to be relatively stable in the second quarter of and higher in the second half of supported by fixedrate asset repricing and hedge maturities net interest income and ratevolume analysis the following table sets forth the major components of net interest income and the related annualized yields and rates for the three months ended march and as well as the variances between the periods caused by changes in interest rates versus changes

dividing annualized net interest income te by average total interest earnings assets market risk analysis interest rate risk is the primary market risk to which synovus is potentially exposed synovus measures the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates through the use of simulation modeling which incorporates all of synovus earning assets and liabilities these simulations are used to determine a baseline net interest income projection and the sensitivity of the income profile based on changes in interest rates these simulations incorporate assumptions and factors including but not limited to changes in market rates in the size or composition of the balance sheet and in repricing characteristics as well as client behaviors for both loans and deposits this includes estimates for deposit repricing characteristics which for purposes of the sensitivity estimates provided below relies upon a constant throughthecycle total deposit cost beta of approximately as of the most recently reported period this process is reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis in a manner consistent with synovus alco governance framework synovus has modeled its baseline net interest income forecast assuming a relatively flat interest rate environment with the federal funds rate at the federal reserves targeted range of to as of march and the prime rate of as of march synovus has modeled the impact of an immediate change in market interest rates across the yield curve of and bps to determine the sensitivity of net interest income for the next months as illustrated in the table below the net interest income sensitivity derived from this simulation suggests that net interest income is projected to increase by and if interest rates increased by and bps respectively net interest income is projected to decrease by and if interest rates decreased by and bps respectively the following table represents the estimated sensitivity of net interest income at march with comparable information for december table month net interest income sensitivity estimated change in net interest income as compared to unchanged rates for the next months change in interest rates in bps march december while all of the above estimates are reflective of the general interest rate sensitivity of synovus local market conditions the realized growth and remixing of the balance sheet as well as the broader macroeconomic environment could all have a significant impact on both the sensitivity and realized level of net interest income additionally should there be differences between realized deposit betas for a given level of rates as compared to the companys estimates for throughthecycle betas this may also have a significant impact on our reported sensitivity and the realized level of net interest income the net interest income simulation model is the primary tool utilized to evaluate potential interest rate risks over a shorterterm time horizon synovus also evaluates potential longerterm interest rate risk through modeling and evaluation of the sensitivity of the companys eve the eve measurement process estimates the net fair value of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet financial instruments under various interest rate scenarios management uses eve sensitivity analyses as an additional means of measuring interest rate risk and incorporates this form of analysis within its governance and limits framework synovus is also subject to market risk in certain of its fee income business lines financial management services revenue which include trust brokerage and asset management fees can be affected by risk in the securities markets primarily the equity securities market a significant portion of the fees in this unit are determined based upon a percentage of asset values weaker securities markets and lower equity values have an adverse impact on the fees generated by these operations trading account assets maintained to facilitate brokerage client activity are also subject to market risk however trading activities are limited and subject to risk policy limits additionally synovus utilizes various tools to measure and manage price risk in its trading portfolio mortgage banking income is also subject to market risk mortgage loan originations are sensitive to levels of mortgage interest rates and therefore mortgage banking income can be negatively impacted during periods of rising interest rates as we have been experiencing throughthecycle the extension of commitments to clients to fund mortgage loans also subjects synovus to market risk this risk is primarily created by the time periods between making the commitment closing and delivering the loan synovus seeks to minimize its exposure by utilizing various risk management tools including forward sales commitments and other economic hedges derivative instruments for interest rate risk management synovus utilizes derivative instruments to manage its exposure to various types of structural interest rate risks by executing enduser derivative transactions designated as hedges hedging relationships may be designated as either a cash flow hedge which mitigates risk exposure to the variability of future cash flows or other forecasted transactions or a fair value hedge which mitigates risk exposure to adverse changes in the fair market value of a fixed rate asset or liability due to changes in market interest rates as of march and december synovus had billion and billion respectively in notional amounts outstanding of both effective and forwardstarting interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedging instruments to hedge its exposure to contractually specified interest rate risk associated with floating rate loans as of march and december synovus had billion and billion respectively in notional amounts outstanding of receivefixed payvariable interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedging instruments to hedge its exposure to the change in the fair value due to fluctuations in market interest rates for outstanding fixedrate longterm debt and fixedrate interestbearing deposits critical accounting policies the accounting and financial reporting policies of synovus are in accordance with gaap and conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities synovus has identified certain of its accounting policies as critical accounting policies consisting of those related to the allowance for credit losses and income taxes in determining which accounting policies are critical in nature synovus has identified the policies that require significant judgment or involve complex estimates it is managements practice to discuss critical accounting policies with the board of directors audit committee on a periodic basis including the development selection implementation and disclosure of the critical accounting policies the application of these policies has a significant impact on synovus unaudited interim consolidated financial statements synovus financial results could differ significantly if different judgments or estimates are used in the application of these policies all accounting policies described in part ii item financial statements and supplementary data note summary of significant accounting policies in synovus form 10k should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance there have been no significant changes to the accounting policies estimates and assumptions or the judgments affecting the application of these estimates and assumptions from those disclosed in synovus form 10k nongaap financial measures the measures entitled adjusted noninterest revenue adjusted noninterest expense adjusted revenue adjusted tangible efficiency ratio adjusted net income available to common shareholders adjusted net income per common share diluted adjusted return on average assets adjusted return on average common equity return on average tangible common equity adjusted return on average tangible common equity and tangible common equity ratio are not measures recognized under gaap and therefore are considered nongaap financial measures the most comparable gaap measures to these measures are total noninterest revenue total noninterest expense total revenue efficiency ratiote net income available to common shareholders net income per common share diluted return on average assets return on average common equity and the ratio of total shareholders equity to total assets respectively management believes that these nongaap financial measures provide meaningful additional information about synovus to assist management and investors in evaluating synovus operating results financial strength the performance of its business and the strength of its capital position however these nongaap financial measures have inherent limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of operating results or capital position as reported under gaap the nongaap financial measures should be considered as additional views of the way our financial measures are affected by significant items and other factors and since they are not required to be uniformly applied they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures at other companies adjusted revenue and adjusted noninterest revenue are measures used by management to evaluate total revenue and noninterest revenue exclusive of net investment securities gains losses and fair value adjustments on nonqualified deferred compensation and other items not indicative of ongoing operations that could impact periodtoperiod comparisons adjusted noninterest expense and the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio are measures utilized by management to measure the success of expense management initiatives focused on reducing recurring controllable operating costs adjusted net income available to common shareholders adjusted net income per common share diluted adjusted return on average assets and adjusted return on average common equity are measurements used by management to evaluate operating results exclusive of items that management believes are not indicative of ongoing operations and impact periodtoperiod comparisons return on average tangible common equity and adjusted return on average tangible common equity are measures used by management to compare synovus performance with other financial institutions because it calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization thereby allowing management to evaluate the performance of the business consistently the computations of these measures are set forth in the tables below management does not provide a reconciliation for forwardlooking nongaap financial measures where it is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort this is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the occurrence and the financial impact of various items that have not yet occurred are out of synovus control or cannot be reasonably predicted for the same reasons synovus management is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information
