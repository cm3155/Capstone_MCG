funding costs as well as higher fees related to borrowings under our unused credit facilities declines in credit ratings could also reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets we believe our funding mix including the proportion of us retail deposits insured by the fdic to total funding should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on our funding capacity and costs on august the federal reserve the occ and the fdic issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that proposed longterm debt requirements that if adopted as proposed would require covered bank holding companies such as american express company to issue and maintain minimum amounts of eligible external longterm debt with specific terms for purposes of absorbing losses or recapitalizing the covered bank holding company and its operating subsidiaries the notice of proposed rulemaking also proposed requiring minimum amounts of eligible internal longterm debt to be maintained by certain insured depository institutions that have at least billion in consolidated assets such as aenb for purposes of absorbing losses or recapitalizing the insured depository institution deposit programs we offer deposits within our us bank subsidiary aenb these funds are currently insured up to an amount that is at least per account holder through the fdic as of september approximately percent of these deposits were insured our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates is dependent on among other factors the capital level of aenb direct retail deposits offered by aenb is our primary deposit product channel which makes fdicinsured highyield savings account certificates of deposit cds business checking and consumer rewards checking account products available directly to customers as of september our direct retail deposit program had approximately million accounts aenb also sources deposits through thirdparty distribution channels as needed to meet our overall funding objectives as of september and december we had billion and billion respectively in deposits refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of these deposits and scheduled maturities of certificates of deposits liquidity management our liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of on and offbalance sheet liquidity sources we seek to maintain liquidity sources in amounts sufficient to meet our expected future financial obligations and business requirements for liquidity for a period of at least twelve months in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions our liquidity management strategy includes a number of elements including but not limited to maintaining diversified funding sources refer to the funding strategy section for more details maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and offbalance sheet liquidity sources projecting cash inflows and outflows under a variety of economic and market scenarios and establishing clear objectives for liquidity risk management including compliance with regulatory requirements the amount and type of liquidity resources we maintain can vary over time based upon the results of stress scenarios required under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act as well as additional stress scenarios required under our liquidity risk policy we believe that we currently maintain sufficient liquidity to meet all internal and regulatory liquidity requirements as of september and december we had billion and billion in cash and cash equivalents respectively refer to the cash flows section below for a discussion of the major drivers impacting cash flows for the nine months ended september the investment income we receive on liquidity resources has historically been less than the interest expense on the sources of funding for these balances from time to time including in this quarter interest income may exceed the interest expense associated with the liquidity portfolio depending on the interest rate environment our funding composition and the amount of liquidity resources we maintain the level of future net interest income or expense associated with our liquidity resources will vary securitized borrowing capacity as of september we maintained committed revolving secured borrowing facilities that give us the right to sell up to billion face amount of eligible aaa notes from american express issuance trust ii the charge trust and up to billion face amount of eligible aaa certificates from american express credit account master trust the lending trust on july we extended the charge trusts facility by two years to mature on july and on september we extended the lending trusts facility by two years to mature on september and increased the maximum face amount of eligible aaa certificates that can be sold using this facility from billion to billion these facilities enhance our contingent funding resources and are also used in the ordinary course of business to fund working capital needs as of september no amounts were drawn on the charge trust facility or lending trust facility committed bank credit facility as of september we maintained a committed syndicated bank credit facility of billion with a maturity date of october this facility enhances our contingent funding resources and is also used in the ordinary course of business to fund working capital needs as of september no amount was drawn on this facility other sources of liquidity in addition to cash and other liquid assets and the secured borrowing facilities and committed bank credit facility described above as an insured depository institution aenb may borrow from the federal reserve bank of san francisco through the discount window against its credit card loans and charge card receivables further in march the federal reserve established an additional facility the bank term funding program btfp the btfp offers loans of up to one year in length to banks and other eligible depository institutions against us treasuries agency debt and mortgagebacked securities and other qualifying assets as collateral any qualifying assets pledged to the btfp are valued at par by the federal reserve for the purpose of determining the amount of collateral we can borrow against the amount of borrowing capacity available to aenb at either the discount window or the btfp is subject to the amount of qualifying collateral that it may pledge as of september aenb had available borrowing capacity of billion as a result of us credit card loans and charge card receivables that were pledged to the federal reserve through the discount window it also had approximately billion in us treasuries agency debt and mortgagebacked securities that could be pledged through the btfp whether specific assets will be considered qualifying collateral and the amount that may be borrowed against the collateral remain at the discretion of the federal reserve due to regulatory restrictions liquidity generated by aenb can generally be used only to fund obligations within aenb and transfers to the parent company or nonbank affiliates may be subject to prior regulatory approval during the three months ended september we did not borrow from either the discount window or the btfp and no amounts were outstanding on either facility at the end of the period unused credit outstanding as of september we had approximately billion of unused credit outstanding primarily available to customers as part of established lending product agreements total unused credit outstanding does not represent potential future cash requirements as a significant portion of this unused credit will likely not be drawn our charge card products generally have no preset spending limit and therefore are not reflected in unused credit outstanding cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flow activity followed by a discussion of the major drivers impacting operating investing and financing cash flows for the nine months ended september table cash flows billions total cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash

included in net income such as provisions for credit losses depreciation and amortization stockbased compensation deferred taxes and other noncash items and ii changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities which can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of payments in the net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by cash generated from net income for the period and higher net operating liabilities primarily resulting from higher accounts payable to merchants and an increase in membership rewards liability partially offset by payments related to annual incentive compensation in the net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by cash generated from net income for the period and higher net operating liabilities primarily resulting from higher accounts payable to merchants and an increase in membership rewards liability driven by higher card member spending cash flows from investing activities our cash flows from investing activities primarily include changes in card member loans and receivables as well as changes in our availableforsale investment securities portfolio in the net cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by higher card member loans and receivables outstanding resulting from higher card member spending in the net cash used in investing activities

primarily include changes in customer deposits longterm debt and shortterm borrowings as well as dividend payments and share repurchases in both the periods presented the net cash provided by financing activities was primarily driven by growth in customer deposits and net proceeds from debt partially offset by share repurchases and dividend payments other matters certain legislative regulatory and other developments supervision regulation we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world and the costs of compliance are substantial the financial services industry is subject to rigorous scrutiny high regulatory expectations a range of regulations and a stringent and unpredictable enforcement environment governmental authorities have focused and we believe will continue to focus considerable attention on reviewing compliance by financial services firms and payment systems with laws and regulations and as a result we continually work to evolve and improve our risk management framework governance structures practices and procedures reviews by us and governmental authorities to assess compliance with laws and regulations as well as our own internal reviews to assess compliance with internal policies including errors or misconduct by colleagues or third parties or control failures have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in changes to our products practices and procedures restitution to our customers and increased costs related to regulatory oversight supervision and examination we have also been subject to regulatory actions and may continue to be the subject of such actions including governmental inquiries investigations enforcement proceedings and the imposition of fines or civil money penalties in the event of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with laws or regulations for example as previously disclosed we are cooperating with governmental investigations related to our historical sales practices which are described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements external publicity concerning investigations can increase the scope and scale of investigations and lead to further regulatory inquiries please see the supervision and regulation and risk factors sections of the form 10k for further information basel iii proposal on july the federal reserve the occ and the fdic issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would significantly revise us regulatory capital requirements for large banking organizations including american express company and aenb the proposed rules would apply a new expanded riskbased approach to calculating riskbased capital ratios and large banking organizations would be required to calculate their riskbased capital ratios under both i the standardized approach and ii the expanded riskbased approach and use the lower of the two ratio calculations to determine binding capital constraints under each riskbased capital ratio the expanded riskbased approach to calculating riskweighted assets would apply more granular riskweighting methodologies for among others credit operational market and equity risks including differential treatment of fee and other noninterest revenues as compared to interest income for purposes of determining operational riskweighted assets the proposed rules would also include additional capital requirements for certain unconditionally cancellable commitments such as unused portions of committed lines of credit eg credit cards and would create a proxy methodology to assign capital requirements to credit exposure on products that carry no preset spending limits such as charge cards under the proposal the revisions would become effective on july subject to a threeyear transition period for certain provisions including phasing in the use of riskweighted assets under the expanded riskbased approach we are currently evaluating the impact of the proposal but based on a preliminary analysis we estimate that the increase in our riskweighted assets under the expanded riskbased approach as currently proposed could consume the capital buffer between our minimum regulatory requirements and our current cet1 riskbased capital ratio this estimated impact reflects our current understanding of the proposal the application to our businesses as currently conducted and the current composition of our balance sheet and therefore does not reflect the impact of any changes we may make in the future as a result of the expanded riskbased approach or otherwise the ultimate impact will depend on the final rulemaking future minimum regulatory requirements as well as management decisions regarding our product constructs capital distributions and target capital levels and there can be no assurance that the impact will not be more or less than currently estimated consumer financial products regulation our consumeroriented activities are subject to regulation and supervision in the united states and internationally in the united states our marketing sale and servicing of consumer financial products and our compliance with certain federal consumer financial laws are supervised and examined by the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb which has broad rulemaking and enforcement authority over providers of credit savings and payment services and products and authority to prevent unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices in addition a number of us states have significant consumer credit protection disclosure and other laws in certain cases more stringent than us federal laws us federal law also regulates abusive debt collection practices which along with bankruptcy and debtor relief laws can affect our ability to collect amounts owed to us or subject us to regulatory scrutiny on february the cfpb issued a proposed rule to lower the safe harbor amount that would be considered by regulation to be reasonable and proportional to the costs incurred by credit card issuers for late payments the proposed rule would also eliminate the annual inflation adjustment for such safe harbor amount and prohibit late fee amounts above percent of the consumers required minimum payment on march the cfpb adopted a final rule requiring covered financial institutions such as us to collect and report data to the cfpb regarding certain small business credit applications based on our small business credit transaction volume we will be required to comply with this rule by october subject to the outcome of litigation over the final rule facing the cfpb for more information on consumer financial products regulation as well as the potential impacts on our results of operations and business please see the supervision and regulation and risk factors sections of the form 10k payments regulation legislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the operation of card networks including through enforcement actions legislation and regulations to change certain practices or pricing of card issuers merchant acquirers and payment networks and in some cases to establish broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regimes for payment systems the european union eu australia canada and other jurisdictions have focused on interchange fees that is the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuer in payment networks like visa and mastercard as well as the rules contract terms and practices governing merchant card acceptance regulation and other governmental actions relating to pricing or practices could affect all networks directly or indirectly as well as adversely impact consumers and merchants among other things regulation of bankcard fees has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact the discount revenue we earn including as a result of downward pressure on our merchant discount rates from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees in some cases regulations also extend to certain aspects of our business such as network and cobrand arrangements or the terms of card acceptance for merchants for example we exited our network business in the eu and australia as a result of regulation in those jurisdictions in addition there is uncertainty as to when or how interchange fee caps and other provisions of the eu payments legislation might apply when we work with cobrand partners and agents in the eu on august the dutch trade and industry appeals tribunal referred questions to the eu court of justice on the interpretation of the application of the interchange fee caps in connection with an administrative proceeding by the netherlands authority for consumers and markets regarding our cobrand relationship with klm royal dutch airlines given differing interpretations by regulators and participants in cobrand arrangements we are subject to regulatory action penalties and the possibility we will not be able to maintain our existing cobrand and agent relationships in the eu broad regulatory oversight over payment systems can also include in some cases requirements for international card networks to localize aspects of their operations such as processing infrastructure and data storage which increases our costs and could diminish the value of our closed loop the development and enforcement of payment system regulatory regimes generally continue to grow and may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and maintain and extend our global network for

surcharging in various countries such as certain member states in the eu australia and canada other than in quebec merchants are permitted to surcharge card purchases in addition the laws of a number of states in the united states that prohibit surcharging have been overturned and certain states have passed or are considering laws to permit surcharging by merchants surcharging is an adverse customer experience and could have a material adverse effect on us particularly where it only or disproportionately impacts credit card usage or card usage generally our card members or our business in addition other steering or differential acceptance practices that are permitted by regulation in some jurisdictions could also have a material adverse effect on us for more information on the potential impacts of surcharging and other actions that could impair the card member experience please see the risk factors section of the form 10k merchant litigation we continue to vigorously defend antitrust and other claims initiated by merchants see note to the consolidated financial statements for descriptions of the cases it is possible that actions impairing the card member experience or
