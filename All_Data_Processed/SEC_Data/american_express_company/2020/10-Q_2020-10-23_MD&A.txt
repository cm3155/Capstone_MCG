federal reserves regulations policies and minimum capital standards business environment businesses and economies around the globe continue to be significantly affected by the covid19 pandemic there continues to be a high degree of uncertainty in terms of the direction of the pandemic and its impact on the economy how governments will react to changes in the environment including possible future stimulus programs or the failure to implement such programs and developments in political and social conditions throughout the quarter our colleague base has continued to successfully operate in a mostly remote working environment to support our customers and merchants we continued to offer financial and other assistance add product benefits to reflect todays environment and provide the high level of customer service they expect and rely on we continued to see lower voluntary attrition rates on our proprietary products as compared to the last year in addition our card members are recognizing our commitment to service excellence ranking us number one in the jd power us credit card satisfaction study for the tenth time we also continued to work with our strategic partners on initiatives to support our communities and launched our largest ever shop small campaign which included a commitment of over million to help support small merchants reflective of the broader economy and spending trends in our customer segments our billed business for the quarter was down percent percent on an fx adjusted basis as compared to the prior year since midapril we have seen steady improvement in our overall billed business proprietary billed business which accounted for percent of our total billings in the third quarter and drives most of our financial results showed different recovery trends for nonte and te spend nonte spend which has historically accounted for a large portion of our billed business recovered to prepandemic levels growing percent as compared to the prior year te spend continued to be down percent yearoveryear though we saw a modest improvement during the quarter primarily driven by proprietary consumer te spend to the extent we continue to see significant yearoveryear declines in billed business our future results will be materially impacted revenues net of interest expense decreased percent as compared to the prior year which was an improvement from yearoveryear decline in the second quarter consistent with the trend in billings discount revenue our largest revenue line decreased percent which was a larger contraction than the decline in billed business for the quarter due to a decrease in the average discount rate the average discount rate decrease was driven by a shift in spend mix to nonte categories although the erosion in the third quarter was less than the second quarter due to the modest improvement in te spend we continued to see decreases in other fees and commissions and other revenues primarily due to declines in travelrelated revenues card fee revenues continued to show strong yearoveryear growth as such revenues are slower to react to economic shifts since they are recognized over a twelvemonth period and card member retention remained high however net card fee growth has decelerated as we slowed new card acquisitions over the last two quarters while managing through the peak of uncertainty during this crisis net interest income declined by percent yearoveryear primarily driven by lower average loans and lower benchmark interest rates partially offset by higher net yield as a result of the spendcentric nature of our business model card member loans and receivables declined percent and percent yearoveryear respectively due to lower billed business volumes provisions for credit losses decreased primarily due to a modest reserve release and lower net writeoffs the reserve release reflected improved credit performance and lower loan volumes partially offset by a more cautious view of the global macroeconomic outlook due to continuing high levels of uncertainty regarding the pace of a recovery in the economy the foreign currency adjusted information assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into us dollars ie assumes the foreign exchange rates used to determine results for the current period apply to the corresponding prior year period against which such results are being compared the balance in our longerterm financial relief programs which are reported as troubled debt restructurings grew to approximately billion of loans and receivables as of september see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on troubled debt restructurings in addition as of september we had billion of delinquent loans and receivables including relevant financial relief program balances which represented a sequential improvement in delinquencies compared to the second quarter our shortterm customer pandemic relief programs are no longer widely available with negligible balances remaining in the programs as of september card member rewards card member services and business development expenses are generally correlated to billings or are variable based on usage and were lower this quarter due to the decline in billing volumes and lower usage of travelrelated benefits during the quarter we remained focused on controlling operating expenses while increasing marketing investments in initiatives to support our customers such as enhancements that we made to value propositions for many of our card products and our largest ever shop small campaign looking ahead we are beginning to place greater emphasis on selectively investing for the long term including through marketing and operating expenses throughout the year our liquidity levels remained high and we also continued to display a strong capital position with capital ratios that are well above our targets and regulatory requirements these robust capital and liquidity levels provide us with significant flexibility to maintain the strength of our balance sheet through this uncertain period we also intend to maintain our quarterly dividend for the fourth quarter in line with prior quarters subject to approval by the board of directors although the external environment remains uncertain in the near term we are confident in how we are managing the company for the long term the investments we are making set a foundation to rebuild our growth momentum and return to prepandemic levels of earnings and financial performance see certain legislative regulatory and other developments and risk factors for information on additional impacts of the covid19 pandemic and related containment efforts as well as other matters that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition critical accounting estimates please see the critical accounting estimates section of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december for a full description of all of our critical accounting estimates the critical accounting estimate related to reserves for card member credit losses presented below has been updated to reflect the adoption of the current expected credit loss cecl methodology reserves for card member credit losses reserves for card member credit losses represent our best estimate of the expected credit losses in our outstanding portfolio of card member loans and receivables as of the balance sheet date the cecl methodology which became effective january requires us to estimate lifetime expected credit losses by incorporating historical loss experience and current and future economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable period rs period beyond the balance sheet date in estimating expected credit losses we use a combination of statistically based models and analysis of the results produced by these models these quantitative and qualitative components entail a significant amount of judgment the primary areas of judgment used in measuring the quantitative components of our reserves relate to the determination of the appropriate rs period the modeling of the probability of and exposure at default and the methodology to incorporate current and future economic conditions we use these models and assumptions combined with historical loss experience to calculate the reserve rates that are applied to the outstanding loan or receivable balances to produce our reserves for expected credit losses beyond the rs period we estimate expected credit losses using our historical loss experience the qualitative component is intended to capture expected losses that may not have been fully captured in the quantitative component through an established governance structure we consider certain external and internal factors including emerging portfolio characteristics and trends which consequentially may increase or decrease the reserves for credit losses on card member loans and receivables the rs period which is approximately years represents the maximum timeperiod beyond the balance sheet date over which we can reasonably estimate expected credit losses using all available portfolio information current economic conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions card member loan products do not have a contractual term and balances can revolve if minimum required payments are made causing some balances to remain outstanding beyond the rs period card member receivable products are contractually required to be paid in full therefore we have assumed the balances will be either paid or writtenoff within the rs period within the rs period our models use past loss experience and current and future economic conditions to estimate the probability of default exposure at default and expected recoveries to estimate net losses at default a significant area of judgment relates to how we apply future card member payments to the reporting period balances when determining the exposure at default the nature of revolving loan products inherently includes a relationship between future payments and spend behavior which creates complexity in the application of how future payments are either partially or entirely attributable to the existing balance at the end of the reporting period using historical customer behavior and other factors we have assumed that future payments are first allocated to interest and fees associated with the reporting period balance and future spend we then allocate a portion of the payment to the estimated higher minimum payment amount due because of any future spend any remaining portion of the future payment would then be allocated to the remaining balance cecl requires that the rs period include an assumption about current and future economic conditions we incorporate multiple macroeconomic scenarios obtained from an independent third party the estimated credit losses calculated from each macroeconomic scenario are reviewed by management and are weighted to reflect managements judgment about uncertainty around the scenarios these macroeconomic scenarios contain certain variables including unemployment rates and real gross domestic product gdp that are significant to our models macroeconomic sensitivity to demonstrate the sensitivity of estimated credit losses to the macroeconomic scenarios we compared our modeled estimate under a baseline scenario to our modeled estimate under a pessimistic downside scenario for every percentage points change in weighting from the baseline scenario to the pessimistic downside scenario the estimated credit losses increased by approximately million the modeled estimates under these scenarios were influenced by the duration severity and timing of changes in economic variables within each scenario and these macroeconomic scenarios under different conditions or using different assumptions could result in significantly different estimated credit losses it is difficult to estimate how potential changes in specific factors might affect the estimated credit losses and current results may not be indicative of the potential future impact of macroeconomic forecast changes in addition this sensitivity analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimates under two scenarios without considering managements judgment on the relative weighting for those and other scenarios including the weight that has been placed on downside scenarios at the balance sheet date or any potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative calculation or the impact of management judgment for qualitative factors which may have a positive or negative effect on the results thus the results of this sensitivity analysis are hypothetical and are not intended to estimate or reflect our expectations of any changes in the overall reserves for credit losses due to changes in the macroeconomic environment the following table reflects the range of key variables in the macroeconomic scenarios utilized for the computation of reserves for credit losses september june us unemployment rate third quarter of fourth quarter of fourth quarter of us gdp growth contraction a third quarter of fourth quarter of fourth quarter of a real gdp quarter over quarter percentage change seasonally adjusted to annualized rates refer to the business environment and table in mda and note and note to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of the impact of cecl both at implementation and for the three and nine months ended september the process of estimating these reserves requires a high degree of judgment to the extent our expected credit loss models are not indicative of future performance actual losses could differ significantly from our judgments and expectations resulting in either higher or lower future provisions for credit losses in any period results of operations refer to the glossary of selected terminology for the definitions of certain key terms and related information appearing within this section the discussions in both the consolidated results of operations and business segment results of operations provide commentary on the variances for the three and nine months ended september compared to the same periods in the prior year as presented in the accompanying tables these discussions should be read in conjunction with the discussion under business environment which contains further information on the covid19 pandemic and the related impacts on our results as a result of the adoption of cecl on january there is a lack of comparability in both the reserves and provisions for credit losses for the periods

restrictions related to the covid19 pandemic which resulted in lower foreign exchange conversion revenue related to decreased crossborder card member spending and lower travel commissions and fees from our consumer travel business as well as a decline in late fees due to lower delinquencies other revenues decreased for both the three and nine month periods primarily driven by a net loss in the current year as compared to net income in the prior year from the gbt jv and lower revenue earned on crossborder card member spending due to the impacts of the covid19 pandemic including travel

our cobrand relationship with delta air lines on march the contract renewal included new pricing terms some of which became effective upon contract signing and others that were tied to the product relaunch these pricing changes as well as changes in the expense classification of certain benefits associated with the relaunch resulted in offsetting increases to marketing and business development and decreases to both card member rewards and card member services expenses as compared to the prior year marketing and business development expense was relatively flat for the three month period and decreased for the nine month period both periods reflected decreases due to a reduction in proactive marketing for card member acquisitions as well as decreases in corporate client incentives and network partner payments due to lower billed business the decreases in the three month period were offset and the decreases in the nine month period were partially offset by incremental investments in enhancements to our card member value proposition as well as expenses related to our shop small campaign and the delta changes described above card member rewards expense decreased for both the three and nine month periods membership rewards and cash back rewards decreased million and million and cobrand rewards decreased million and million for the three and nine month periods respectively these decreases were primarily driven by lower billed business as a result of the impacts of the covid19 pandemic in addition changes in redemption mix due to a decline in higher cost travel redemptions

generation of net income capital generated through net income and other sources such as the exercise of stock options by employees is used to maintain a strong balance sheet support asset growth and engage in acquisitions with excess available for distribution to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases we maintain certain flexibility to shift capital across our businesses as appropriate for example we may infuse additional capital into subsidiaries to maintain capital at targeted levels in consideration of debt ratings and regulatory requirements these infused amounts can

august the federal reserve announced our scb requirement of percent and resulting common equity tier capital requirement of percent failure to maintain minimum regulatory capital levels at american express or aenb could affect our status as a financial holding company and cause the regulatory agencies with oversight of american express or aenb to take actions that could limit our business operations in light of the covid19 pandemic and its impact on the economy the federal reserve is requiring all banking organizations participating in comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar including us to resubmit capital plans by november to reflect changes in financial markets and the macroeconomic outlook share repurchases and dividends we return capital to common shareholders through dividends and share repurchases the share repurchases reduce common shares outstanding and generally more than offset the issuance of new shares as part of employee compensation plans during the three and nine months ended september we returned billion and billion respectively to our shareholders in the form of common stock dividends of billion and billion respectively and share repurchases of nil and billion respectively in addition during the three and nine months ended september we paid million and million respectively in dividends on noncumulative perpetual preferred shares outstanding our decisions on capital distributions will depend on various factors including our capital levels and regulatory capital requirements actual and forecasted business results economic and market conditions revisions to or revocation of the federal reserves authorization of our capital plan and the ccar process due to the uncertain business environment we have suspended share repurchases since march to maintain financial strength since then the federal reserve has announced that it is prohibiting share repurchases in the third and fourth quarters for all banking organizations participating in ccar and will allow them to pay common stock dividends provided a they do not increase the amount of the dividend and b they do not exceed the average of a firms net income for the four preceding calendar quarters funding strategy our principal funding objective is to maintain broad and welldiversified funding sources to allow us to meet our maturing obligations costeffectively finance current and future asset growth in our global businesses as well as to maintain a strong liquidity profile we meet our funding needs through a variety of sources including direct and thirdparty distributed deposits and debt instruments such as senior unsecured debt asset securitizations borrowings through secured borrowing facilities and a committed bank credit facility while we seek to diversify our funding sources by maintaining scale and relevance in unsecured debt asset securitizations and deposits we currently expect that direct deposits such as the personal savings program will become a larger proportion of our funding over time given the significant reductions in our business volumes and changes in growth outlook we do not currently expect to have meaningful unsecured or secured term debt issuances for the remainder of summary of consolidated debt we had the following consolidated debt and customer deposits outstanding as of september and

stable downgrades in the ratings of our unsecured debt or asset securitization program securities could result in higher funding costs as well as higher fees related to borrowings under our unused lines of credit declines in credit ratings could also reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets we believe our funding mix including the proportion of us retail deposits insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic to total funding should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on our funding capacity and costs liquidity management our liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of on and offbalance sheet liquidity sources we seek to maintain liquidity sources in amounts sufficient to meet our expected future financial obligations and business requirements for liquidity for a period of at least twelve months in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions our liquidity management strategy includes a number of elements including but not limited to maintaining diversified funding sources refer to the funding strategy section for more details maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and offbalance sheet liquidity sources projecting cash inflows and outflows under a variety of economic and market scenarios establishing clear objectives for liquidity risk management including compliance with regulatory requirements and incorporating liquidity risk management as appropriate into our capital adequacy framework the amount and type of liquidity resources we maintain can vary over time based upon the results of stress scenarios required under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act as well as additional stress scenarios required under our liquidity risk policy we believe that we currently maintain sufficient liquidity to meet all internal and regulatory liquidity requirements as of september we had cash and cash equivalents of billion the increase of billion from billion as of december was primarily driven by the decline in the balances of our card member loans and receivables the net interest expense to maintain these liquidity resources depends on the amount of liquidity resources we maintain and the difference between our cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields as the amount of our liquidity resources has increased the level of future net interest expense to maintain these resources is expected to be significant as the investment income is less than the cost of funding securitized borrowing capacity as of september we maintained our committed revolving secured borrowing facility with a maturity date of july which gives us the right to sell up to billion face amount of eligible aaa notes from the american express issuance trust ii the charge trust as the balance of card member receivables in the charge trust fluctuates over time in line with business volumes our capacity to draw on the charge trust facility may be reduced when volumes decline we also maintained our committed revolving secured borrowing facility with a maturity date of september which gives us the right to sell up to billion face amount of eligible aaa certificates from the american express credit account master trust the lending trust both facilities are used in the ordinary course of business to fund working capital needs as well as to further enhance our contingent funding resources as of september no amounts were drawn on the charge trust facility or the lending trust facility federal reserve discount window as an insured depository institution aenb may borrow from the federal reserve bank of san francisco subject to

through the discount window whether specific assets will be considered qualifying collateral and the amount that may be borrowed against the collateral remain at the discretion of the federal reserve we had approximately billion as of september in us credit card loans and charge card receivables that could be sold over time through our securitization trusts or pledged in return for secured borrowings to provide further liquidity subject in each case to applicable market conditions and eligibility criteria committed bank credit facility in addition to the secured borrowing facilities described above we maintained a committed syndicated bank credit facility as of september of billion with a maturity date of october as of september no amounts were drawn on this facility unused credit outstanding and certain contractual obligations as of september we had approximately billion of unused credit available to card members as part of established lending product agreements total unused credit available to card members does not represent potential future cash requirements as a significant portion of this unused credit will likely not be drawn our charge card products generally have no preset spending limit and therefore are not reflected in unused credit available to card members we provide card member protection that covers losses associated with purchased goods and

included in net income such as provisions for credit losses depreciation and amortization deferred taxes and stockbased compensation and ii changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities which can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of payments the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities over the periods of comparison was primarily driven by the significant decline in billed business resulting in lower accounts payable and other liabilities and purchases of loyalty program points from certain of our cobrand partners which resulted in an increase in other assets these points are held as prepaid assets until they are used for rewards promotions and incentives cash flows from investing activities our cash flows from investing activities primarily include changes in card member loans and receivables as well as changes in our availableforsale investment securities portfolio the increase in net cash provided by investing activities over the periods of comparison was primarily driven by a decline in the balances outstanding from card member loans and receivables as card members continued to pay down outstanding balances combined with a significant decline in card member spending during the period due to the continued impacts of the covid19 pandemic and the resulting containment measures partially offset by a net increase in the investment securities portfolio cash flows from financing activities our cash flows from financing activities primarily include changes in customer deposits longterm debt and shortterm borrowings as well as dividend payments and share repurchases the increase in net cash used in financing activities over the periods of comparison was primarily driven by higher net repayment of debt partially offset by higher growth in customer deposits and the suspension of the share repurchase program other matters certain legislative regulatory and other developments supervision regulation we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world and the costs of compliance are substantial in recent years the financial services industry has been subject to rigorous scrutiny high regulatory expectations an increasing range of regulations and a stringent and unpredictable enforcement environment governmental authorities have focused and we believe will continue to focus considerable attention on reviewing compliance by financial services firms with laws and regulations and as a result we continually work to evolve and improve our risk management framework governance structures practices and procedures reviews to assess compliance with laws and regulations by governmental authorities as well as our own internal reviews have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in changes to our products practices and procedures restitution to our customers and increased costs related to regulatory

authorities around the world have implemented numerous measures to contain the virus such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelterinplace orders and business shutdowns in addition to these measures which have substantially curtailed household and business activity fiscal and monetary policy measures have been deployed for the stated purpose of attempting to mitigate the adverse effects on the economy in the united states this has included the enactment of the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act and a number of emergency lending and liquidity facilities established by the federal reserve among other things the cares act created a new loan guarantee program in which we participated called the paycheck protection program designed to provide small businesses with support to cover payroll and certain other expenses the cares act also provides financial institutions with the option to temporarily suspend i certain requirements under us gaap for loan modifications related to the covid19 pandemic that would otherwise be treated as troubled debt restructurings and ii any determination that a loan modified as a result of the covid19 pandemic is a troubled debt restructuring including impairment for accounting purposes there have also been various governmental actions taken or proposed to provide forms of relief such as limiting debt collections efforts and encouraging or requiring extensions modifications or forbearance with respect to certain loans and fees governmental actions taken in response to the covid19 pandemic have not always been coordinated or consistent across jurisdictions but in general have been expanding in scope and intensity the efficacy and ultimate effect of these actions is not known we continue to monitor federal state and international regulatory developments in relation to the covid19 pandemic and their potential impact on our operations payments regulation legislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the operation of card networks including through antitrust actions legislation and regulations to change certain practices or pricing of card issuers merchant acquirers and payment networks and in some cases to establish broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regimes for payment systems the european union australia and other jurisdictions have focused on interchange fees that is the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuer in payment networks like visa and mastercard as well as the rules contract terms and practices governing merchant card acceptance regulation and other governmental actions relating to pricing or practices could affect all networks directly or indirectly as well as adversely impact consumers and merchants among other things regulation of bankcard fees has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact the discount revenue we earn including as a result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees in some cases regulations also extend to certain aspects of our business such as network and cobrand arrangements or the terms of card acceptance for merchants there is uncertainty as to when or how interchange fee caps and other provisions of the eu payments legislation might apply when we work with cobrand partners and agents in the eu given differing interpretations by regulators and participants in cobrand arrangements we are subject to regulatory action penalties and the possibility we will not be able to maintain our existing cobrand and agent relationships in the eu broad regulatory oversight over payment systems can also include in some cases requirements for international card networks to localize aspects of their operations such as processing infrastructure and data storage which could increase our costs and diminish the value of our closed loop the

unaudited impaired loans and receivables impaired loans and receivables are individual larger balance or homogeneous pools of smaller balance loans and receivables for which it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the customer agreement we consider impaired loans and receivables to include i loans over days past due still accruing interest ii nonaccrual loans and iii loans and receivables modified as troubled debt restructurings tdrs in instances where the customer is experiencing financial difficulty we may modify through various financial relief programs loans and receivables with the intention to minimize losses and improve collectability while providing customers with temporary or permanent financial relief we have classified loans and receivables in these modification programs as tdrs and continue to classify customer accounts that have exited a modification program as a tdr with such accounts identified as out of program tdrs such modifications to the loans and receivables primarily include i temporary interest rate reductions possibly as low as zero percent in which case the loan is characterized as nonaccrual in our tdr disclosures ii placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not to exceed months and iii suspending delinquency fees until the customer exits the modification program upon entering the modification program the customers ability to make future purchases is either limited canceled or in certain cases suspended until the customer successfully exits from the modification program in accordance with the modification agreement with the customer loans andor receivables may revert back to the original contractual terms including the contractual interest rate where applicable when the customer exits the modification program which is i when all payments have been made in accordance with the modification agreement or ii when the customer defaults out of the modification program reserves for modifications deemed tdrs are measured individually and incorporate a discounted cash flow model all changes in the impairment measurement are included within provisions for credit losses in response to the covid19 pandemic the united states introduced the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act which among other things provides financial institutions with the option to temporarily suspend i certain requirements under us gaap for loan modifications related to the covid19 pandemic that would otherwise be treated as tdrs and ii any determination that a loan modified as a result of the covid19 pandemic is a tdr including impairment for accounting purposes based on the nature of our programs we have not elected the accounting and reporting relief afforded by this guidance and continue to report modifications as tdrs in the first quarter of we created a customer pandemic relief cpr program for customers who have been impacted by the covid19 pandemic to provide a concession in the form of payment deferrals and waivers of certain fees and interest we assessed the cpr program and determined that eligible loan modifications

for credit losses represent our best estimate of the expected credit losses in our outstanding portfolio of card member loans and receivables as of the balance sheet date the cecl methodology which became effective january requires us to estimate lifetime expected credit losses by incorporating historical loss experience as well as current and future economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable period rs period beyond the balance sheet date we make various judgments combined with historical loss experience to calculate a reserve rate that is applied to the outstanding loan or receivable balance to produce a reserve for expected credit losses we use a combination of statisticallybased models that incorporate current and future economic conditions throughout the rs period the process of estimating expected credit losses is based on several key models probability of default pd exposure at default ead and future recoveries for each month of the rs period beyond the rs period we estimate expected credit losses using our historical loss rates pd models are used to estimate the likelihood an account will be writtenoff ead models are used to estimate the balance of an account at the time of writeoff this includes balances less expected repayments based on historical payment and revolve behavior which vary by customer due to the nature of revolving loan portfolios the ead models are complex and involve assumptions regarding the relationship between future spend and payment behaviors recovery models are used to estimate amounts that are expected to be received from card members after default occurs typically as a result of collection efforts future recoveries are estimated taking into consideration the time of default time elapsed since default and macroeconomic conditions we also estimate the likelihood and magnitude of recovery of previously written off accounts considering how long ago the account was written off and future economic conditions our models are developed using historical loss experience covering the economic cycle and consider the impact of account characteristics on expected losses future economic conditions that are incorporated over the rs period include multiple macroeconomic scenarios provided to us by an independent third party management reviews these economic scenarios quarterly and uses their judgment to weight them in order to reflect the uncertainty surrounding these scenarios these macroeconomic scenarios contain certain variables including unemployment rates and real gross domestic product that are significant to our models we also evaluate whether to include qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but in our assessment may not be adequately represented in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions we consider whether to adjust the quantitative reserves higher or lower to address possible limitations within the models or factors not included within the models such as external conditions emerging portfolio trends the nature and size of the portfolio portfolio concentrations the volume and severity of past due accounts or management risk actions lifetime losses for most of our loans and receivables are evaluated at an appropriate level of granularity including assessment on a pooled basis where financial assets share similar risk characteristics such as past spend and remittance behaviors credit bureau scores where available delinquency status tenure of balance outstanding amongst others credit losses on accrued interest are measured and presented as part of reserves for credit losses on the consolidated balance sheets and within the provisions for credit losses in the consolidated statements of income rather than reversing interest income separate models are used for accounts deemed a troubled debt restructuring which are measured individually using a discounted cash flow model see note for information on troubled debt restructurings loans and receivable balances are written off when we consider amounts to be uncollectible which is generally determined by the number of days past due and is typically no later than days past due for pay in full or revolving loans and days past due for term loans loans and receivables in bankruptcy or owed by deceased individuals are generally written off upon notification results for reporting

arbitration proceedings claims investigations examinations information gathering requests subpoenas inquiries and matters relating to compliance with laws and regulations collectively legal proceedings based on our current knowledge and taking into consideration our litigationrelated liabilities we do not believe we are a party to nor are any of our properties the subject of any legal proceeding that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or liquidity however in light of the uncertainties involved in such matters including the fact that some pending legal proceedings are at preliminary stages or seek an indeterminate amount of damages it is possible that the outcome of legal proceedings could have a material impact on our results of operations certain legal proceedings involving us or our subsidiaries are described below a putative merchant class action in the eastern district of new york consolidated in and collectively captioned in re american express antisteering rules antitrust litigation ii alleged that provisions in our merchant agreements prohibiting merchants from differentially surcharging our cards or steering a customer to use another networks card or another type of generalpurpose card antisteering and nondiscrimination contractual provisions violate us antitrust laws on january our motion to compel arbitration of claims brought by merchants who accept american express and to dismiss claims of merchants who do not was granted plaintiffs have appealed part of this decision on february we were named as a defendant in a case filed in the superior court of california los angeles county captioned laurelwood cleaners llc v american express co et al in which the plaintiff seeks a public injunction prohibiting american express from enforcing its antisteering and nondiscrimination provisions and from requiring merchants to offer the service of amexcard acceptance for free we intend to vigorously defend the case in july we were named as a defendant in another putative class action filed in the southern district of new york and subsequently transferred to the eastern district of new york captioned the marcus corporation v american express co et al in which the plaintiffs allege an unlawful antitrust tying arrangement between certain of our charge cards and credit cards in violation of various state and federal laws the plaintiffs in this action seek injunctive relief and an unspecified amount of damages on march plaintiffs br supermarket inc dba milams market and grove

motion to dismiss as to claims brought by merchants who do not accept american express cards and on may the california court transferred the case to the united states district court for the eastern district of new york on august the court granted plaintiffs motion for class certification we are being challenged in a number of countries regarding our application of valueadded taxes vat to certain of our international transactions which are in various stages of audit or are being contested in legal actions while we believe we have complied with all applicable tax laws rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions the tax authorities may determine that we owe additional vat in certain jurisdictions where we are contesting the assessments we were required to pay the vat assessments prior to contesting american express company notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited our legal proceedings range from cases brought by a single plaintiff to class actions with millions of putative class members to governmental proceedings these legal proceedings involve various lines of business and a variety of claims including but not limited to common law tort contract application of tax laws antitrust and consumer protection claims some of which present novel factual allegations andor unique legal theories while some matters pending against us specify the damages sought many seek an unspecified amount of damages or are at very early stages of the legal process even when the amount of damages claimed against us are stated the claimed amount may be exaggerated andor unsupported as a result some matters have not yet progressed sufficiently through discovery andor development of important factual information and legal issues to enable us to estimate an amount of loss or a range of possible loss while other matters have progressed sufficiently such that we are able to estimate an amount of loss or a range of possible loss we have accrued for certain of our outstanding legal proceedings an accrual is recorded when it is both a probable that a loss has occurred and b the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated there may be instances in which an exposure to loss exceeds the accrual we evaluate on a quarterly basis developments in legal proceedings that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the accrual that has been previously recorded or a revision to the disclosed estimated range of possible losses as applicable for those disclosed material legal proceedings where a loss is reasonably possible in future periods whether in excess of a recorded accrual for legal or tax contingencies or where there is no such accrual and for which we are able to estimate a range of possible loss the current estimated range is zero to million in excess of any accruals related to those matters this range represents managements estimate based on currently available information and does not represent our maximum loss exposure actual results may vary significantly as such legal proceedings evolve we may need to increase our range of possible loss or recorded accruals in addition it is possible that significantly increased merchant steering or other actions impairing the card member experience as a result of an adverse resolution in one or any combination of the disclosed merchant cases could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition we face exposure associated with card member purchases of goods and services including with respect to the following return protection refunds the price of qualifying purchases made with eligible cards where the merchant will not accept the return for up to days from the date of purchase and merchant protection protects card members primarily against nondelivery of goods and services usually in the event of the bankruptcy or liquidation of a merchant when this occurs the card member may dispute the transaction for which we will generally credit the card members account if we are unable to collect the amount from the merchant we may bear the loss for the amount credited to the card member the largest component of the exposure relates to card member transactions associated with travelrelated merchants primarily through business arrangements where we have remitted payment to such merchants for a card member travel purchase that has not yet been used or flown we have an accrual of million related to these exposures as of september to date we have not experienced significant losses related to these exposures however our historical experience may not be representative in the current environment given the economic and financial disruptions caused by the covid19 pandemic and resulting containment measures a reasonable possible loss related to these exposures in excess of the recorded accrual cannot be quantified as the card member purchases that may include or result in claims are not sufficiently estimable although we believe our risk of loss has increased in the current environment american express company notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited derivatives and hedging activities we use derivative financial instruments to manage exposures to various market risks these instruments derive their value from an underlying variable or multiple variables including interest rates foreign exchange rates and an equity index or price and are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets these instruments enable end users to increase reduce or alter exposure to various market risks and for that reason are an integral component of our market risk management we do not transact in derivatives for trading purposes in relation to our credit risk certain of our bilateral derivative agreements include provisions that allow our counterparties to terminate the agreement in the event of a downgrade of our debt credit rating below investment grade and settle the outstanding net liability position as of september these derivatives were not in a significant net liability position based on our assessment of the credit risk of our derivative counterparties and our own credit risk as of september and december no credit risk adjustment to the derivative portfolio was required a majority of our derivative assets and liabilities as of september and december are subject to master netting

significant business operations the tax years under examination and open for examination vary by jurisdiction we are currently under examination by the irs for the and tax years we believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits could decrease within the next months by as much as million principally as a result of potential resolutions of prior years tax items with various taxing authorities the prior years tax items include unrecognized tax benefits relating to the deductibility of certain expenses or losses and the attribution of taxable income to a particular
