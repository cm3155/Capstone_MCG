customer working with all of our partners we will continue to seek to provide value choice and unique experiences across our customer base our spendcentric model and revenue mix our spendcentric business model focuses on generating revenues primarily by driving spending on our cards and secondarily through finance charges and fees spending on our cards which is higher on average on a percard basis versus our competitors offers superior value to merchants in the form of loyal customers and larger transactions because of the revenues generated from having highspending card members and the annual card fees we charge on many of our products we are able to invest in attractive rewards and other benefits for card members as well as targeted marketing and other programs and investments for

will look to build on our strong position in commercial payments by evolving our card value propositions further differentiating our corporate card and accounts payable expense management solutions and designing innovative products and features including financing and supplier payment solutions for our business customers third we are focused on strengthening our global network to provide unique value by continuing to help merchants navigate the convergence of online and offline commerce with fraud protection services marketing insights and digital connections to higherspending card members and continuing to work with our network partners to offer expanded products and services finally we want to continue to make american express an essential part of our customers digital lives by developing more digital features solutions and services expanding our digital partnerships and making targeted acquisitions competition we compete in the global payments industry with card networks issuers and acquirers paperbased transactions eg cash and checks bank transfer models eg wire transfers and automated clearing house or ach as well as evolving and growing alternative payment and financing providers as the payments industry continues to evolve we face increasing competition from nontraditional players that leverage new technologies business models and customer relationships to create payment or financing solutions as a card issuer we compete with financial institutions that issue generalpurpose charge and credit cards and debit cards we also encounter competition from businesses that issue their own private label cards operate their own mobile wallets or extend credit to their customers we face intense competition for cobrand relationships as both card issuer and network competitors have targeted key business partners with attractive value propositions our global card network competes in the global payments industry with other card networks including among others china unionpay visa mastercard jcb discover and diners club international which is owned by discover we are the fourth largest generalpurpose card network globally based on purchase volume behind china unionpay visa and mastercard in addition to such networks a range of companies globally including merchant acquirers processors and web and mobilebased payment platforms eg alipay paypal and venmo as well as regional payment networks such as the national payments corporation of india carry out some activities similar to those performed by our gmns business the principal competitive factors that affect the cardissuing merchant and network businesses include the features value and quality of the products and services including customer care rewards programs partnerships benefits and digital and mobile services and the costs associated with providing such features and services reputation and brand recognition the number spending characteristics and credit performance of customers the quantity diversity and quality of the establishments where the cards can be used the attractiveness of the value proposition to card issuers merchant acquirers cardholders corporate clients and merchants including the relative cost of using or accepting the products and services and capabilities such as fraud prevention and data analytics the number and quality of other payment cards and other forms of payment available to customers the success of marketing and promotional campaigns the speed of innovation and investment in systems technologies and product and service offerings the nature and quality of expense management tools electronic payment methods and data capture and reporting capabilities particularly for business customers the security of cardholder and merchant information another aspect of competition is the dynamic and rapid growth of alternative payment mechanisms systems and products which include payment aggregators eg paypal square and amazon marketplace lenders wireless payment technologies including using mobile telephone networks to carry out transactions financial technology companies electronic wallet and push payment providers including handset manufacturers telecommunication providers retailers banks and technology companies digital currencies developed by both governments and the private sector blockchain and similar distributed ledger technologies realtime settlement and processing prepaid systems and gift cards and systems linked to payment cards or that provide payment solutions various competitors are working to integrate more financial services into their product offerings and competitors are attempting to replicate our closedloop functionality such as the merchantprocessing platform chasenet new payments competitors continue to emerge in response to evolving technologies consumer habits and merchant needs in addition to the discussion in this section see our operating results may materially suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the payments industry in risk factors for further discussion of the potential impact of competition on our business and our business is subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and legal proceedings regarding provisions in our merchant contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business and result in additional litigation andor arbitrations substantial monetary damages and damage to our reputation and brand in risk factors for a discussion of the potential impact on our ability to compete effectively due to government regulations or if ongoing legal proceedings limit our ability to prevent merchants from engaging in various actions to discriminate against our card products supervision and regulation overview we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world and the costs of compliance are substantial in recent years the financial services industry has been subject to rigorous scrutiny high regulatory expectations an increasing range of regulations and a stringent and unpredictable enforcement environment governmental authorities have focused and we believe will continue to focus considerable attention on reviewing compliance by financial services firms with laws and regulations and as a result we continually work to evolve and improve our risk management framework governance structures practices and procedures reviews to assess compliance with laws and regulations by governmental authorities as well as our own internal reviews have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in changes to our products practices and procedures restitution to our customers and increased costs related to regulatory oversight supervision and examination we have also been subject to regulatory actions and may continue to be the subject of such actions including governmental inquiries investigations enforcement proceedings and the imposition of fines or civil money penalties in the event of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with laws or regulations in addition legislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the operation of card networks including through antitrust actions legislation and regulations to change certain practices or pricing of card issuers merchant acquirers and payment networks and in some cases to establish broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regimes for payment systems see risk factorslegal regulatory and compliance risks for a discussion of the potential impact legislative and regulatory changes may have on our results of operations and financial condition banking regulation federal and state banking laws regulations and policies extensively regulate the company which for purposes of this section refers to american express company as a bank holding company trs and our us bank subsidiary american express national bank aenb both the company and trs are subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision regulation and examination by the federal reserve and aenb is likewise supervised regulated and examined by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ the company and its subsidiaries are also subject to the rulemaking enforcement and examination authority of the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb banking regulators have broad examination and enforcement power including the power to impose substantial fines limit dividends and other capital distributions restrict operations and acquisitions and require divestitures many aspects of our business also are subject to rigorous regulation by other us federal and state regulatory agencies and by nonus government agencies and regulatory bodies the federal reserve has established a new rating system for large financial institutions such as the company which is intended to align with the federal reserves existing supervisory program for large financial institutions and which includes component ratings for capital planning liquidity risk management and governance and controls in august and january the federal reserve proposed related guidance for the governance and controls component activities the bhc act generally limits bank holding companies to activities that are considered to be banking activities and certain closely related activities as noted above each of the company and trs is a bank holding company and each has elected to become a financial holding company which is authorized to engage in a broader range of financial and related activities in order to remain eligible for financial holding company status we must meet certain eligibility requirements those requirements include that each of the company and aenb must be well capitalized and well managed and aenb must have received at least a satisfactory rating on its most recent assessment under the community reinvestment act of the cra the company and trs engage in various activities permissible only for financial holding companies including in particular providing travel agency services acting as a finder and engaging in certain insurance underwriting and agency services if the company fails to meet eligibility requirements for financial holding company status it is likely to be barred from engaging in new types of financial activities or making certain types of acquisitions or investments in reliance on its status as a financial holding company and ultimately could be required to either discontinue the broader range of activities permitted to financial holding companies or divest aenb in addition the company and its subsidiaries are prohibited by law from engaging in practices that the relevant regulatory authority deems unsafe or unsound which such authorities generally interpret broadly acquisitions and investments applicable federal and state laws place limitations on the ability of persons to invest in or acquire control of us without providing notice to or obtaining the approval of one or more of our regulators in addition we are subject to banking laws and regulations that limit our investments and acquisitions and in some cases subject them to the prior review and approval of our regulators including the federal reserve and the occ federal banking regulators have broad discretion in evaluating proposed acquisitions and investments that are subject to their prior review or approval financial regulatory reform in october the us federal bank regulatory agencies finalized rules that tailor the application of the enhanced prudential standards to bank holding companies and depository institutions the tailoring rules pursuant to the amendments to the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of dodd frank introduced by the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act the tailoring rules assign each us bank holding company with billion or more in total consolidated assets as well as its bank subsidiaries to one of four categories based on its status as a us global systemically important banking organization and five other riskbased indicators i size ii crossjurisdictional activity iii nonbank assets iv offbalance sheet exposure and v weighted shortterm wholesale funding under the tailoring rules the company and pursuant to the tailoring rules its depository institution subsidiary aenb is subject to category iv standards as a category iv firm the company is among other things i no longer subject to the advanced approaches capital requirements ii no longer subject to the supplementary leverage ratio slr iii no longer subject to the countercyclical capital buffer iv no longer subject to companyrun stress testing requirements v subject to supervisory stress testing on an everyotheryear basis rather than an annual basis and vi no longer subject to the requirement to prepare and submit a holding companylevel resolution plan in addition as a category iv firm with less than billion in weighted shortterm wholesale funding the company is no longer subject to the liquidity coverage ratio lcr because a firms categorization under the tailoring rules is determined by and can change over time dependent upon how the firm measures against the riskbased indicator thresholds we are required to monitor and periodically report these riskbased indicators and there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be a category iv firm in the future stress testing and capital planning under the federal reserves regulations the company is subject to supervisory stress testing requirements that are designed to evaluate whether a bank holding company has sufficient capital on a total consolidated basis to absorb losses and support operations under adverse economic conditions as a category iv firm the company will be subject to the federal reserves supervisory stress tests every other year beginning in rather than on an annual cycle we remain subject to the requirement to develop and submit to the federal reserve an annual capital plan the federal reserve has stated it plans to propose changes which would include providing firms subject to category iv standards additional flexibility to develop their capital plans as part of the comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar the federal reserve evaluates whether the company has sufficient capital to continue operations by assessing our proforma capital position and ratios under a scenario of economic and financial market stress sufficient capital for these purposes is likely to require us to maintain capital ratios appreciably above applicable minimum requirements and buffers the federal reserve is expected to publish the decisions for all the bank holding companies participating in ccar including the reasons for any objection to capital plans by june in addition the federal reserve will publish separately the results of its supervisory stress test under the supervisory severely adverse scenario the information to be released will include among other things the federal reserves projection of companyspecific information including poststress capital ratio information over the planning horizon we may be required to revise and resubmit our capital plan as required by the federal reserve following certain events such as a significant acquisition in addition to other limitations our ability to make any capital distributions including dividends and share repurchases is contingent on the federal reserves nonobjection to our capital plan dividends and other capital distributions the company and trs as well as aenb and the companys insurance and other regulated subsidiaries are limited in their ability to pay dividends by statutes regulations and supervisory policy dividend payments by the company to shareholders are subject to the oversight of the federal reserve see stress testing and capital planning even if the federal reserve has not objected to a distribution the company may still not make a distribution without federal reserve approval if among other things the company would not meet a minimum regulatory capital ratio after giving effect to the capital distribution changes in facts would require resubmission of our capital plan or the companys earnings are materially underperforming its projections in the capital plan in general federal laws and regulations prohibit without first obtaining the occs approval aenb from making dividend distributions to trs if such distributions are not paid out of available recent earnings or would cause aenb to fail to meet capital adequacy standards in addition to specific limitations on the dividends aenb can pay to trs federal banking regulators have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of a dividend if in the banking regulators opinion payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the institution capital leverage and liquidity regulation capital rules the company and aenb are required to comply with the applicable capital adequacy rules established by federal banking regulators these rules are intended to ensure that bank holding companies and depository institutions collectively banking organizations have adequate capital given their level of assets and offbalance sheet obligations the federal banking regulators current capital rules the capital rules implement the basel committee on banking supervisions the basel committee framework for strengthening international capital regulation known as basel iii for additional information regarding our capital ratios see consolidated capital resources and liquidity under mda under the capital rules banking organizations are required to maintain minimum ratios for common equity tier cet1 tier capital that is cet1 plus additional tier capital and total capital that is tier capital plus tier capital to riskweighted assets since we have reported our capital adequacy ratios on a parallel basis to federal banking regulators using both riskweighted assets calculated under the basel iii standardized approach as adjusted for certain items and the requirements for an advanced approaches institution as a category iv firm we are no longer subject to the basel iii advanced approaches capital requirements in december the basel committee published standards that among other things revise the standardized approach for credit risk including by recalibrating risk weights and introducing additional capital requirements for certain unconditionally cancellable commitments such as unused credit card lines of credit and provide a new standardized calculation for operational risk capital requirements if adopted in the united states as issued by the basel committee and applicable to us the new standards could result in higher capital requirements for us the company and aenb must each maintain cet1 tier capital and total capital ratios of at least percent percent and percent respectively the capital rules also implement a percent capital conservation buffer composed entirely of cet1 on top of these minimum riskweighted asset ratios as a result the minimum ratios are effectively percent percent and percent for the cet1 tier capital and total capital ratios respectively federal banking regulators may further increase required minimum capital ratios by a countercyclical capital buffer composed entirely of cet1 up to percent if they determine that such a buffer is necessary to protect the banking system from disorderly downturns associated with excessively expansionary periods under the tailoring rules category iv firms such as the company would not be subject to such a countercyclical capital buffer banking institutions whose ratio of cet1 tier capital or total capital to riskweighted assets is above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on discretionary distributions such as dividends repurchases and redemptions of capital securities and executive compensation based on the amount of the shortfall and the institutions eligible retained income that is four quarter trailing net income net of distributions and tax effects not reflected in net income the federal reserve proposed a rule in april that would among other things replace the static percent capital conservation buffer with a stress capital buffer requirement for bank holding companies subject to the ccar process the stress capital buffer would reflect stressed losses in the supervisory severely adverse scenario of the federal reserves ccar stress tests and would also include four quarters of planned common stock dividends the proposal also included a stress leverage buffer requirement similar to the stress capital buffer which would apply to the tier leverage ratio the proposal would require bank holding companies to reduce their planned capital distributions if those distributions would not be consistent with the applicable capital buffer constraints based on the bank holding companies own baseline scenario projections the federal reserve has indicated that it intends to propose revisions to the stress buffer requirements that would be applicable to category iv firms such as the company to align with the twoyear supervisory stresstesting cycle for category iv bank holding companies leverage requirements we are also required to comply with minimum leverage ratio requirements the leverage ratio is the ratio of a banking organizations tier capital to its average total consolidated assets as defined for regulatory purposes all banking organizations are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least percent the capital rules also establish an slr requirement for advanced approaches banking organizations the slr is the ratio of tier capital to an expanded concept of leverage exposure that includes both onbalance sheet and certain offbalance sheet exposures the capital rules require a minimum slr of percent as noted above category iv firms such as the company are not subject to the slr requirement under the tailoring rules liquidity regulation the federal reserves enhanced prudential standards rule includes heightened liquidity and overall risk management requirements the rule requires the maintenance of a liquidity buffer consisting of highly liquid assets that is sufficient to meet projected net outflows for days over a range of liquidity stress scenarios and a minimum lcr that measures a firms highquality liquid assets to its projected net outflows under the tailoring rules category iv firms with less than billion in weighted shortterm wholesale funding such as the company are no longer subject to any lcr requirement a second standard provided for in the basel iii liquidity framework referred to as the net stable funding ratio nsfr requires a minimum amount of longerterm funding based on the assets and activities of banking entities although the nsfr has not been finalized the federal reserve staffs memorandum has indicated it will be applied in a manner consistent with the application of the lcr under the tailoring rules provided a category iv firms weighted shortterm wholesale funding remains below billion prompt corrective action the federal deposit insurance act fdia requires among other things that federal banking regulators take prompt corrective action in respect of depository institutions insured by the fdic such as aenb that do not meet minimum capital requirements the fdia establishes five capital categories for fdicinsured banks well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized the fdia imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations management and capital distributions depending on the capital category in which an institution is classified in order to be considered well capitalized aenb must maintain cet1 tier capital total capital and tier leverage ratios of percent percent percent and percent respectively under the fdia aenb could be prohibited from accepting brokered deposits ie deposits raised through thirdparty brokerage networks or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in its normal market area or nationally depending upon where the deposits are solicited unless it is well capitalized or it is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the fdic a significant amount of our outstanding us retail deposits are considered brokered deposits for bank regulatory purposes if a federal regulator determines that we are in an unsafe or unsound condition or that we are engaging in unsafe or unsound banking practices the regulator may reclassify our capital category or otherwise place restrictions on our ability to accept or solicit brokered deposits in december the fdic issued a proposed rule intended to update and modernize the fdics brokered deposit regulations the proposed rule among other things would revise the definition of deposit broker and the accompanying exceptions resolution planning pursuant to dodd frank certain bank holding companies are required to submit resolution plans to the federal reserve and fdic providing for the companys strategy for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of its material financial distress or failure however in connection with the release of the tailoring rules the federal reserve and fdic finalized rules in october which among other things adjust the review cycles and applicability of the agencies resolution planning requirements under these new rules category iv firms such as the company are no longer required to submit a holding company resolution plan aenb continues to be required to prepare and provide a separate resolution plan to the fdic that would enable the fdic as receiver to effectively resolve aenb under the fdia in the event of failure the fdic has issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on potential revisions to this separate resolution plan requirement for insured depository institutions and the next round of insured depository institution resolution plan submissions will not be required until the rulemaking process is complete orderly liquidation authority the company could become subject to the orderly liquidation authority ola a resolution regime under which the treasury secretary may appoint the fdic as receiver to liquidate a systemically important financial institution if the company is in danger of default and is determined to present a systemic risk to us financial stability as under the fdic resolution model under the ola the fdic has broad power as receiver substantial differences exist however between the ola and the fdic resolution model for depository institutions including the right of the fdic under the ola to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims in limited circumstances the use of an administrative claims procedure to determine creditor claims as opposed to the judicial procedure used in bankruptcy proceedings and the right of the fdic to transfer claims to a bridge entity the fdic has developed a strategy under ola referred to as the single point of entry or spoe strategy under which the fdic would resolve a failed financial holding company by transferring its assets including shares of its operating subsidiaries and potentially very limited liabilities to a bridge holding company utilize the resources of the failed financial holding company to recapitalize the operating subsidiaries and satisfy the claims of unsecured creditors of the failed financial holding company and other claimants in the receivership by delivering securities of one or more new financial companies that would emerge from the bridge holding company under this strategy management of the failed financial holding company would be replaced and its shareholders and creditors would bear the losses resulting from the failure fdic powers upon insolvency of aenb if the fdic is appointed the conservator or receiver of aenb the fdic has the power to transfer any of aenbs assets and liabilities to a new obligor without the approval of aenbs creditors to enforce the terms of aenbs contracts pursuant to their terms or to repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which aenb is a party the performance of which is determined by the fdic to be burdensome and the disaffirmation or repudiation of which is determined by the fdic to promote the orderly administration of aenb in addition the claims of holders of us deposit liabilities and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic against aenb would be afforded priority over other general unsecured claims against aenb including claims of debt holders and depositors in nonus offices in the liquidation or other resolution of aenb as a result whether or not the fdic ever sought to repudiate any debt obligations of aenb the debt holders and depositors in nonus offices would be treated differently from and could receive substantially less if anything than the depositors in the us offices of aenb other banking regulations source of strength the company is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its us bank subsidiary aenb and may be required to commit capital and financial resources to support aenb such support may be required at times when absent this requirement the company otherwise might determine not to provide it capital loans by the company to aenb are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of aenb in the event of the companys bankruptcy any commitment by the company to a federal banking regulator to maintain the capital of aenb will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment transactions between aenb and its affiliates certain transactions including loans and credit extensions from aenb between aenb and its affiliates including the company trs and their other subsidiaries are subject to quantitative and qualitative limitations collateral requirements and other restrictions imposed by statute and regulation transactions subject to these restrictions are generally required to be made on an armslength basis fdic deposit insurance and insurance assessments aenb accepts deposits that are insured by the fdic up to the applicable limits under the fdia the fdic may terminate the insurance of an institutions deposits upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law regulation rule order or condition imposed by the fdic we do not know of any practice condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance at aenb the fdics deposit insurance fund is funded by assessments on insured depository institutions including aenb which are subject to adjustment by the fdic community reinvestment act aenb is subject to the cra which imposes affirmative ongoing obligations on depository institutions to meet the credit needs of their local communities including low and moderateincome neighborhoods consistent with the safe and sound operation of the institution in december the occ and fdic issued a notice of proposed rulemaking intended to i clarify which activities qualify for cra credit ii update where activities count for cra credit and iii change the methods for cra measurement data collection recordkeeping and reporting consumer financial products regulation in the united states our marketing sale and servicing of consumer financial products and our compliance with certain federal consumer financial laws are supervised and examined by the cfpb which has broad rulemaking and enforcement authority over providers of credit savings and payment services and products and authority to prevent unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices in addition a number of us states have significant consumer credit protection disclosure and other laws in certain cases more stringent than us federal laws us federal law also regulates abusive debt collection practices which along with bankruptcy and debtor relief laws can affect our ability to collect amounts owed to us or subject us to regulatory scrutiny on may the cfpb issued proposed rules that would set forth additional requirements for thirdparty debt collection agencies which we use in the ordinary course of business this proposal is not expected to result in final rules if any becoming effective before we are also regulated in the united states under the money transmitter or sale of check laws in effect in most states in addition we are required by the laws of many states to comply with unclaimed and abandoned property laws under which we must pay to states the face amount of any travelers cheque or prepaid card that is uncashed or unredeemed after a period of time depending on the type of product in countries outside the united states regulators continue to focus on a number of key areas impacting our cardissuing businesses particularly consumer protection such as in the european union eu the united kingdom and canada and responsible lending such as in australia mexico new zealand and singapore with increasing importance on and attention to customers and outcomes rather than just ensuring compliance with local rules and regulations regulators expectations of firms in relation to their compliance risk and control frameworks continue to increase and regulators are placing significant emphasis on a firms systems and controls relating to the identification and resolution of issues payments regulation legislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the operation of card networks including through antitrust actions legislation and regulations to change certain practices or pricing of card issuers merchant acquirers and payment networks and in some cases to establish broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regimes for payment systems the eu australia and other jurisdictions have focused on interchange fees that is the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuer in payment networks like visa and mastercard as well as the rules contract terms and practices governing merchant card acceptance for example in april the european commission accepted commitments by visa and mastercard to significantly reduce interregional multilateral interchange fees regulation and other governmental actions relating to pricing or practices could affect all networks directly or indirectly as well as adversely impact consumers and merchants among other things regulation of bankcard fees has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact the discount revenue we earn including as a result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees in some cases regulations also extend to certain aspects of our business such as network and cobrand arrangements or the terms of card acceptance for merchants and we have largely exited our network businesses in the eu and australia as a result of regulation in those jurisdictions for example in various countries such as certain member states in the eu and australia merchants are permitted by law to surcharge card purchases in addition the laws of a number of states in the united states that prohibit surcharging have been challenged in litigation brought by merchant groups and some such laws have been overturned surcharging is an adverse customer experience and could have a material adverse effect on us if it becomes widespread particularly where it only or disproportionately impacts our business in addition other steering practices that are permitted by regulation in some countries could also have a material adverse effect on us if they become widespread see surcharging or steering by merchants could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations under risk factors in canada regulators have prompted the major international card networks to make voluntary commitments on pricing specifically interchange fee levels as american express does not operate with interchange fees in canada our commitments extend to maintaining current pricing practices and complying with certain other practices in some countries governments have established regulatory regimes that require international card networks to be locally licensed andor to localize aspects of their operations for example the reserve bank of india which has broad power under the payment and settlement systems act to regulate the membership and operations of card networks has issued a mandate requiring payment systems operators in india to store certain payments data locally the development and enforcement of payment system regulatory regimes generally continue to grow and may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and maintain and extend our global network governments in some countries also provide resources or protection to select domestic payment card networks the peoples bank of china officially accepted our application for a business operating license to process domestic currency transactions through a joint venture in mainland china there can be no assurance that we will receive such a license or if we do that we will be able to successfully compete in china with domestic payment card networks and
