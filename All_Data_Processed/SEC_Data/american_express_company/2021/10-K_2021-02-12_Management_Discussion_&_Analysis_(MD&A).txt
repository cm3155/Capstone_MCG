revenue nongaap measures we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap however certain information included within this report constitutes nongaap financial measures our calculations of nongaap financial measures may differ from the calculations of similarly titled measures by other companies business environment the covid19 pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges to businesses and economies around the world our financial results were significantly down yearoveryear reflecting the impact of the deterioration in the global economy due to the pandemic and the related containment measures there remains a high degree of uncertainty relating to the ongoing spread and severity of the virus and new variants as well as the availability distribution and use of effective treatments and vaccines to the extent that the global economy continues to be negatively impacted by the pandemic our results will be affected with credit trends and spending volumes being the key drivers of our financial performance throughout we focused and made substantial progress on our four priorities to manage through this period of uncertainty supporting our colleagues and winning as a team protecting our customers and our brand structuring the company for growth in the future and remaining financially strong since the first quarter of our colleague base has successfully operated in a mostly remote working environment and we have sought to ensure that our colleagues have the flexibility and resources they needed to stay safe healthy and productive to support our customers and merchants we offered financial and other assistance added product benefits to reflect todays environment and provided the high level of customer service they expect and rely on we experienced lower voluntary attrition rates on our proprietary products compared to the prior year in addition our card members continued to recognize our commitment to service excellence ranking us number one in the jd power us credit card satisfaction study for the tenth time we worked with our strategic partners on initiatives to support our communities and launched our largest ever shop small campaign to help support small merchants in addition we remained committed to strengthening inclusion and diversity and committed to an action plan to promote racial ethnic and gender equity for our colleagues customers and communities reflective of the impacts of the pandemic and the broader macroeconomic environment our billed business for the year was down percent compared to the prior year with a low in midapril followed by a gradual recovery over the remainder of the year proprietary billed business which accounted for percent of our total billings and drives most of our financial results was also down by percent since midapril we have seen steady improvement in our overall billed business with different recovery trends in te and nonte spend nonte spend which has historically accounted for a large portion of our billed business recovered to prepandemic levels in the second half of the year resulting in a full year decline of percent compared to the prior year te spend continued to be significantly impacted throughout the course of the year although we saw a modest improvement from the lows of midapril primarily driven by proprietary consumer te spend resulting in a yearoveryear decline of percent revenues net of interest expense decreased percent compared to the prior year consistent with the trend in billings discount revenue our largest revenue line decreased percent which was a larger contraction than the decline in billed business for the year due to a decrease in the average discount rate the average discount rate decrease was driven by a shift in spend mix to nonte categories other fees and commissions and other revenues declined yearoveryear primarily driven by a reduction in travelrelated revenues card fee revenues which are recognized over a twelvemonth period and therefore are slower to react to economic shifts continued to grow as compared to the prior year while card member retention remained high throughout the year net card fee growth decelerated as we slowed new card acquisitions to manage through the peak of uncertainty during the crisis net interest income declined by percent yearoveryear primarily driven by lower average loans as a result of the spendcentric nature of our business model card member loans and receivables declined percent and percent yearoveryear respectively due to lower billed business volumes provisions for credit losses increased primarily due to a higher reserve build reflecting the deterioration of the global macroeconomic outlook including unemployment and gross domestic product gdp partially offset by improved credit performance and lower loan and receivable volumes in order to provide support to our customers impacted by the pandemic we created a shortterm customer pandemic relief program and enhanced our longerterm financial relief programs the total balance of loans and receivables that were in a delinquent status or in one of our financial relief programs peaked in the second quarter and then declined sequentially through the remainder of the year in addition our writeoffs and delinquencies were down yearoveryear reflecting our strong risk management practices the record levels of government stimulus and the broad availability of forbearance programs card member rewards card member services and business development expenses are generally correlated to billings or are variable based on usage and were lower this year due to the decline in billing volumes and lower usage of travelrelated benefits during the year we remained focused on controlling operating expenses while investing in marketing initiatives to support our customers such as enhancements that we made to value propositions for many of our card products and our largest ever shop small campaign throughout the year our liquidity levels and capital position remained strong with capital ratios that are well above our targets and regulatory requirements these robust liquidity and capital levels provide us with significant flexibility to maintain the strength of our balance sheet through this uncertain period looking forward we remain committed to capital distributions through dividend payments and resuming share repurchases up to our maximum capacity authorized by the federal reserve in the first quarter of our progress in managing through the pandemic over the last year confirms the resilience of our differentiated business model which includes a loyal and diverse customer base a valued brand our global merchant network and our integrated payments platform all of this supported by our resilient colleagues around the world provides us with a solid foundation as we move into which we see as a transition year we will still be managing through the effects of the pandemic but with an increased focus on maximizing investments in areas that will enable us to rebuild growth momentum see supervision and regulation in business for information on legislative and regulatory changes that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

product portfolios card fees which are recognized over a twelvemonth period are slower to react to economic shifts such as those arising from the impacts of the covid19 pandemic other fees and

the contract renewal included new pricing terms some of which became effective upon contract signing and others that were tied to the product relaunch these pricing changes as well as changes in the expense classification of certain benefits associated with the relaunch resulted in an increase to marketing and business development and decreases to both card member rewards and card member services expenses as compared to the prior year marketing and business development expense decreased primarily due to a temporary reduction in proactive marketing for card member acquisitions as well as decreases in corporate client incentives and network partner payments due to lower billed business all of which were a result of the impacts of the covid19 pandemic partially offset by incremental investments in limited time enhancements to our card member value proposition to maintain customer engagement and the delta changes described above card member rewards expense decreased primarily driven by decreases in membership rewards and cash back rewards expenses of million and cobrand rewards expense of million both of which were primarily driven by lower billed business as a result of

financing obligations and business requirements for at least a twelvemonth period in the event we are unable to continue to raise new funds under our traditional funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions we are closely monitoring the changing macroeconomic environment and actively managing our balance sheet to reflect evolving circumstances our objective is to remain financially strong against a backdrop of an uncertain operating environment and outlook capital strategy we believe capital allocated to growing businesses with a return on riskadjusted equity in excess of our costs will generate shareholder value our objective is to retain sufficient levels of capital generated through net income and other sources such as the exercise of stock options by employees to maintain a strong balance sheet provide flexibility to support future business growth and distribute excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases see dividends and share repurchases below the level and composition of our consolidated capital position are determined through our internal capital adequacy assessment process which takes into account our business activities as well as marketplace conditions and requirements or expectations of credit rating agencies regulators and shareholders among others as a bank holding company we are subject to regulatory requirements administered by the us federal banking agencies the federal reserve has established specific capital adequacy guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets liabilities and certain offbalance sheet items failure to maintain minimum regulatory capital levels at american express or our us bank subsidiary american express national bank aenb could affect our status as a

dividends and share repurchases we return capital to common shareholders through dividends and share repurchases the share repurchases reduce common shares outstanding and generally more than offset the issuance of new shares as part of employee compensation plans during the year ended december we returned billion to our shareholders in the form of common stock dividends of billion and share repurchases of billion we repurchased million common shares at an average price of in these dividend and share repurchase amounts collectively represent approximately percent of total capital generated during the year in addition during the year ended december we paid million in dividends on noncumulative perpetual preferred shares outstanding for additional information on our preferred

and forecasted business results economic and market conditions revisions to or revocation of the federal reserves authorization of our capital plan and the comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar process due to the uncertain business environment we suspended share repurchases in march to maintain financial strength subsequently the federal reserve announced that it would prohibit share repurchases in the third and fourth quarters of for all banking organizations participating in ccar and would allow them to pay common stock dividends provided a they do not increase the amount of the

million authorized by the federal reserve share purchases under publicly announced programs are made pursuant to open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions including employee benefit plans as market conditions warrant and at prices we deem appropriate funding strategy our principal funding objective is to maintain broad and welldiversified funding sources to allow us to meet our maturing obligations costeffectively finance asset growth in our global businesses as well as to maintain a strong liquidity profile the diversity of funding sources by type of instrument by maturity and by investor base among other factors mitigates the impact of disruptions in any one type of instrument maturity or investor the mix of our funding in any period will seek to achieve cost efficiency consistent with both maintaining diversified sources and achieving our liquidity objectives we seek to diversify our funding sources by maintaining scale and relevance in unsecured debt asset securitizations and deposits our direct retail deposits have become a larger proportion of our funding over time and we expect that will continue our funding strategy and activities are integrated into our assetliability management activities we have in place a funding policy covering american express company and all of our subsidiaries our global proprietary cardissuing businesses generate significant assets in both domestic and international card member lending and receivable activities our financing needs are in large part a consequence of our proprietary cardissuing businesses and the maintenance of a liquidity position to meet regulatory requirements and support all of our business activities such as merchant payments we generally pay merchants for card transactions prior to reimbursement by card members and therefore fund the merchant payments during the period card member loans and receivables are outstanding we also have additional financing needs associated with general corporate purposes our funding plan to meet these financing needs is in turn driven by among other factors our liquidity position size and mix of business asset growth choice of funding sources and our maturing obligations due to the impact of covid19 we experienced significant reductions in our business volumes and decline in the balances of our card member loans and receivables the decline in card member loans and receivables balances resulted in substantial liquidity levels which were further strengthened by the strong growth in our direct retail deposits in funding programs and activities we meet our funding needs through a variety of sources including direct and thirdparty distributed deposits and debt instruments such as senior unsecured debt asset securitizations borrowings through secured borrowing facilities and a committed bank credit facility we had the following consolidated debt and customer deposits outstanding as of december table summary of consolidated debt and customer deposits table start billions shortterm borrowings longterm debt total debt customer deposits total debt and customer deposits table end we may redeem from time to time certain debt securities prior to the original contractual maturity dates in accordance with the optional redemption provisions of those debt securities our funding plan for the full year includes among other sources a limited amount of unsecured and secured term debt issuance actual funding activities can vary from our plans due to various factors such as future business growth the impact of global economic political and other events on market capacity and funding needs demand for securities offered by us regulatory changes ability to securitize and sell receivables and the performance of receivables previously sold in securitization transactions many of these factors are beyond our control our equity capital and funding strategies are designed among other things to maintain appropriate and stable unsecured debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies moodys investor services moodys standard poors sp and fitch ratings fitch such ratings help support our

to buy or hold any of our securities and they may be revised or revoked at any time at the sole discretion of the rating organization downgrades in the ratings of our unsecured debt or asset securitization program securities could result in higher funding costs as well as higher fees related to borrowings under our unused credit facilities declines in credit ratings could also reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets we believe our funding mix including the proportion of us retail deposits insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic to total funding should reduce the impact that credit rating downgrades would have on our funding capacity and costs shortterm funding programs shortterm borrowings such as commercial paper are defined as any debt with an original maturity of twelve months or less as well as interestbearing overdrafts with banks our shortterm funding programs are used primarily to fund working capital needs such as managing seasonal variations in receivables balances the amount of shortterm borrowings issued in the future will depend on our funding strategy our needs and market conditions as of december we had nil in commercial paper outstanding and we had an average of million in commercial paper outstanding during refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of these borrowings deposit programs we offer deposits within our us bank subsidiary aenb these funds are currently insured up to an amount that is at least per account holder through the fdic our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates is dependent on among other factors the capital level of aenb direct retail deposits offered by aenb is our primary deposit product channel which makes fdicinsured highyield savings account and certificates of deposit cds products available directly to consumers aenb also sources deposits through thirdparty distribution channels as needed to meet our overall funding objectives as of december we had billion in deposits refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of these deposits longterm debt and asset securitization programs as of december we had billion in longterm debt outstanding including unsecured debt and assetbacked securities refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of these borrowings we periodically securitize card member loans and receivables arising from our card business as the securitization market provides us with costeffective funding securitization of card member loans and receivables is accomplished through the transfer of those assets to a trust which in turn issues securities collateralized by the transferred assets to thirdparty investors the proceeds from issuance are distributed to us through our wholly owned subsidiaries as consideration for the transferred assets refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of our asset securitizations on february we removed us consumer and small business card member receivables from the american express issuance trust ii the charge trust and substantially replaced them with us corporate card member receivables on april we added approximately billion of additional us corporate card member receivables to the charge trust given the significant reductions in our business volumes and our resulting substantial cash and liquidity position we did not issue any unsecured or secured term debt during liquidity management our liquidity objective is to maintain access to a diverse set of on and offbalance sheet liquidity sources we seek to maintain liquidity sources in amounts sufficient to meet our expected future financial obligations and business requirements for liquidity for a period of at least twelve months in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions our liquidity management strategy includes a number of elements including but not limited to maintaining diversified funding sources refer to the funding strategy section for more details maintaining unencumbered liquid assets and offbalance sheet liquidity sources projecting cash inflows and outflows under a variety of economic and market scenarios and establishing clear objectives for liquidity risk management including compliance with regulatory requirements we seek to maintain access to a diverse set of onbalance sheet and offbalance sheet liquidity sources including cash and other liquid assets committed bank credit facilities and secured borrowing facilities through our us bank subsidiary aenb we also hold collateral eligible for use at the federal reserves discount window the amount and type of liquidity resources we maintain can vary over time based upon the results of stress scenarios required under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act as well as additional stress scenarios required under our liquidity risk policy these stress scenarios possess distinct characteristics varying by cash flow assumptions time horizon and qualifying liquidity sources among other factors scenarios under our liquidity risk policy include marketwide firmspecific and combined liquidity stresses we consider other factors in determining the amount and type of liquidity we maintain such as economic and financial market conditions seasonality in business operations growth in our businesses potential acquisitions or dispositions the cost and availability of alternative liquidity sources and credit rating agency guidelines and requirements we believe that we currently maintain sufficient liquidity to meet all internal and regulatory liquidity requirements as of december we had a total of billion in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities which are substantially comprised of us government treasury obligations the increase of billion from billion as of december was primarily driven by the decline in the balances of our card member loans and receivables and the growth in our direct retail deposits the net interest expense to maintain these liquidity resources depends on the amount of liquidity resources we maintain and the difference between our cost of funding these amounts and their investment yields as the amount of our liquidity resources has substantially increased the level of future net interest expense to maintain these resources is expected to be significant as the investment income is less than the cost of funding securitized borrowing capacity as of december we maintained our committed revolving secured borrowing facility with a maturity date of july which gives us the right to sell up to billion face amount of eligible aaa notes from the charge trust as the balance of card member receivables in the charge trust fluctuates over time in line with business volumes our capacity to draw on the charge trust facility may be reduced when volumes decline we also maintained our committed revolving secured borrowing facility with a maturity date of september which gives us the right to sell up to billion face amount of eligible aaa certificates from the american express credit account master trust the lending trust both facilities are used in the ordinary course of business to fund working capital needs as well as to further enhance our contingent funding resources as of december no amounts were drawn on the charge trust facility or the lending trust facility federal reserve discount window as an insured depository institution aenb may borrow from the federal reserve bank of san francisco subject to the amount of qualifying collateral that it may pledge the federal reserve has indicated that both credit and charge card receivables are a form of qualifying collateral for secured borrowings made through the discount window whether specific assets will be considered qualifying collateral and the amount that may be borrowed against the collateral remain at the discretion of the federal reserve we had approximately billion as of december in us credit card loans and charge card receivables that could be sold over time through our securitization trusts or pledged in return for secured borrowings to provide further liquidity subject in each case to applicable market conditions and eligibility criteria committed bank credit facility in addition to the secured borrowing facilities described above we maintained a committed syndicated bank credit facility as of december of billion with a maturity date of october the availability of this credit line is subject to compliance with certain covenants by american express credit corporation credco principally the maintenance by credco of a ratio of its combined earnings certain capital contributions and fixed charges to fixed charges as of december and credco was in compliance with each of these covenants as of december no amounts were drawn on the committed credit facility we may from time to time use this facility in the ordinary course of business to fund working capital needs any undrawn portion of this facility could serve as backstop for the amount of commercial paper outstanding our committed bank credit facility does not contain a material adverse change clause which might otherwise preclude borrowing under the credit facility nor is it dependent on our credit rating cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flow activity followed by a discussion of the major drivers impacting operating investing and financing cash flows for the year ended december compared to the year ended december table cash flows table start billions total cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents table end cash flows from operating activities our cash flows from operating activities primarily include net income adjusted for i noncash items included in net income such as provisions for credit losses depreciation and amortization deferred taxes and stockbased compensation and ii changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities which can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of payments the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by decreases in net income and accounts payable due to decreases in merchant payables reflecting the significant decline in billed business in the current year and an increase in other assets due to purchases of loyalty program points from certain of our cobrand partners these points are held as prepaid assets until they are used for rewards promotions and incentives cash flows from investing activities our cash flows from investing activities primarily include changes in card member loans and receivables as well as changes in our availableforsale investment securities portfolio the increase in net cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to a decline in the outstanding balances of card member loans and receivables driven by a significant decline in card member spending during the period as a result of the continued impacts of the covid19 pandemic and the resulting containment measures combined with pay down of outstanding balances by card members partially offset by a net increase in the investment securities portfolio cash flows from financing activities our cash flows from financing activities primarily include changes in customer deposits longterm debt and shortterm borrowings as well as dividend payments and share repurchases the increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by higher net repayment of debt partially offset by higher growth in customer deposits and the suspension of the share repurchase program offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we have identified both on and offbalance sheet transactions arrangements obligations and other relationships that may have a material current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition results of operations or liquidity and capital resources

us american express retirement plan for the us american express retirement restoration plan and nonus defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans contributions in are anticipated to be approximately million and this amount has been included within other longterm liabilities remaining obligations under defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans aggregating million have not been included in the table above as the timing of such obligations is not determinable additionally other longterm liabilities do not include billion of membership rewards liabilities which are not considered longterm liabilities as card members in good standing can redeem points immediately without restrictions and because the timing of point redemption is not determinable f as of december we had committed to provide funding related to certain tax credit investments resulting in a million unfunded commitment included in other longterm liabilities in addition to this amount there was a further million of contractual offbalance sheet obligations that have not been included in the table above as the timing of such obligations is not determinable refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information in addition to the contractual obligations noted in table we have financial commitments related to agreements with certain cobrand partners under which we are required to make a certain level of minimum payments over the life of the agreement generally ranging from five to ten years such commitments are designed to be satisfied by the payments we make to such cobrand partners primarily based on card members spending and earning rewards on their cobrand cards and as we acquire new card members in the event these payments do not fully satisfy the commitment we generally pay the cobrand partner up to the amount of the commitment in exchange for an equivalent value of reward points as of december we had approximately billion in such commitments outstanding and also had certain cobrand arrangements that include commitments based on variables the values of which are not yet determinable and thus the amount is not quantifiable refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further information we also have offbalance sheet arrangements that include guarantees indemnifications and certain other offbalance sheet arrangements guarantees as of december we had guarantees and indemnifications totaling approximately billion related primarily to real estate and business dispositions in the ordinary course of business refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our guarantees certain other offbalance sheet arrangements as of december we had approximately billion of unused credit available to card members as part of established lending product agreements total unused credit available to card members does not represent potential future cash requirements as a significant portion of this unused credit will likely not be drawn our charge card products generally have no preset spending limit and therefore are not reflected in unused credit available to card members we provide card member protection that covers losses associated with purchased goods and services we have an accrual of million related to this exposure as of december to date we have not experienced significant losses related to this exposure however our historical experience may not be representative in the current environment given the economic and financial disruption cause by the covid19 pandemic and resulting containment measures see arrangements with our business partners represent a significant portion of our business we are exposed to risks associated with our business partners including reputational issues business slowdowns bankruptcies liquidations restructurings and consolidations and the possible obligation to make payments to our partners under risk factors and note to the consolidated financial statements for further information risk management governance we use our comprehensive enterprisewide risk management erm program to identify aggregate monitor and manage risks the program also defines our risk appetite governance culture and capabilities the implementation and execution of the erm program is headed by our chief risk officer risk management

and report major risks in addition the asset liability committee chaired by our chief financial officer is responsible for managing our capital funding and liquidity investment market risk and assetliability activities in accordance with our policies and in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements as defined in the erm policy we follow the three lines of defense approach to risk management the first line of defense comprises functions and management committees directly initiating risk taking the chief executive officer business unit presidents and the chief financial officer are part of the first line of defense the second line comprises independent functions overseeing risktaking activities of the first line the chief risk officer the chief compliance ethics officer the chief operational risk officer and certain control groups both at the enterprise level and within regulated entities are part of the second line of defense the global risk oversight team oversees the policies strategies frameworks models processes and capabilities deployed by the first line teams and provides challenges and independent assessments on how the first line of defense is managing risks our internal audit group constitutes the third line of defense and provides independent assessments and effective challenge of the first and second lines of defense credit risk management process credit risk is defined as loss due to obligor or counterparty default or changes in the credit quality of a counterparty or security our credit risks are divided into two broad categories individual and institutional each has distinct risk management capabilities strategies and tools business units that create individual or institutional credit risk exposures of significant importance are supported by dedicated risk management teams each led by a chief credit officer individual credit risk individual credit risk arises from consumer and small business charge cards credit cards and term loans these portfolios consist of millions of customers across multiple geographies industries and levels of net worth we benefit from the highquality profile of our customers which is driven by our brand premium customer servicing product features and risk management capabilities which span underwriting customer management and collections the risk in these portfolios is generally correlated to broad economic trends such as unemployment rates and gdp growth the business unit leaders and their chief credit officers take the lead in managing the credit risk process these chief credit officers are guided by the individual credit risk committee icrc which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the individual credit risk management policy the icrc ensures compliance with ermc guidelines and procedures and escalates to the ermc as appropriate credit risk management is supported by sophisticated proprietary scoring and decisionmaking models that use uptodate information on prospects and customers such as spending and payment history and data feeds from credit bureaus we have developed datadriven economic decision logic for customer interactions to better serve our customers institutional credit risk institutional credit risk arises principally within our gcs and gmns businesses as well as investment and liquidity management activities unlike individual credit risk institutional credit risk is characterized by a lower loss frequency but higher severity it is affected both by general economic conditions and by clientspecific events the absence of large losses in any given year or over several years is not necessarily representative of the level of risk of institutional portfolios given the infrequency of loss events in such portfolios similar to individual credit risk business units taking institutional credit risks are supported by chief credit officers these officers are guided by the institutional risk management committee irmc which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the institutional credit risk management policy and for providing guidance to the credit officers of each business unit with substantial institutional credit risk exposures the committee along with the business unit chief credit officers makes investment decisions in core risk capabilities ensures proper implementation of the underwriting standards and contractual rights for risk mitigation monitors risk exposures and determines risk mitigation actions the irmc formally reviews large institutional risk exposures to ensure compliance with ermc guidelines and procedures and escalates them to the ermc as appropriate at the same time the irmc provides guidance to the business unit risk management teams to optimize riskadjusted returns on capital a centralized risk rating unit provides risk assessment of our institutional obligors exposure to the airline and travel industry we have multiple important cobrand rewards merchant acceptance and corporate payments arrangements with airlines the erm program evaluates the risks posed by our airline partners and the overall airline strategy companywide through comprehensive business analysis of global airlines and the travel industry more broadly including cruise lines travel agencies and tour operators our largest airline partner is delta and this relationship includes an exclusive cobrand credit card partnership and other arrangements including membership rewards redemption merchant acceptance travel and corporate payments see we face intense competition for partner relationships which could result in a loss or renegotiation of these arrangements that could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and arrangements with our business partners represent a significant portion of our business we are exposed to risks associated with our business partners including reputational issues business slowdowns bankruptcies liquidations restructurings and consolidations and the possible obligation to make payments to our partners under risk factors for additional information debt exposure as part of our ongoing risk management process we monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and nonsovereign customers and counterparties and measure and manage concentrations of risk by geographic regions as well as by economic sectors and industries a primary focus area for monitoring is credit deterioration due to weaknesses in economic and fiscal profiles we evaluate countries based on the market assessment of the riskiness of their sovereign debt and our assessment of the economic and financial outlook and closely monitor those deemed high risk as of december we considered our gross credit exposures to government entities financial institutions and corporations in those countries deemed high risk to be individually and collectively not material operational risk management process we consider operational risk to be the risk of loss due to among other things inadequate or failed processes people or information systems or impacts from the external environment including failures to comply with laws and regulations as well as impacts from relationships with third parties operational risk is inherent in all business activities and can impact an organization through direct or indirect financial loss brand damage customer dissatisfaction or legal and regulatory penalties to appropriately measure and manage operational risk we have implemented a comprehensive operational risk framework that is defined in the operational risk management policy approved by the risk committee the operational risk management committee ormc chaired by the chief operational risk officer coordinates with all control groups on effective risk assessments and controls and oversees the preventive responsive and mitigation efforts by operational excellence teams in the business units and staff groups we use the operational risk framework to identify measure monitor and report inherent and emerging operational risks this framework supervised by the ormc consists of a operational risk event capture b a project office to coordinate issue management and control enhancements c key risk indicators and d process and entitylevel risk assessments the framework requires the assessment of operational risk events to determine root causes impact to customers andor us and resolution plan accountability to correct any defect remediate customers and enhance controls and testing to mitigate future issues the impact is assessed from an operational financial brand regulatory compliance and legal perspective information and cyber security we define information and cyber security risk as the risk that a security incident could impact the confidentiality integrity or availability of american express customer colleague or proprietary information our information and cyber security program is designed to protect the confidentiality integrity and availability of information and information systems from unauthorized access use disclosure disruption modification or destruction the program is built upon a foundation of advanced security technology a wellstaffed and highly trained team of experts and robust operations based on the national institute of standards and technology cybersecurity framework this consists of controls designed to identify protect detect respond and recover from information and cyber security incidents we continue to invest in enhancements to cyber security capabilities and engage in industry and government forums to promote advancements to the broader financial services cyber security ecosystem see a major information or cyber security incident or an increase in fraudulent activity could lead to reputational damage to our brand and material legal regulatory and financial exposure and could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards under risk

and maintaining our corporatewide compliance risk management program pursuant to this program we seek to manage and mitigate compliance risk by assessing controlling monitoring measuring and reporting the legal and regulatory risks to which we are exposed the compliance risk management committee crmc chaired by the chief compliance and ethics officer is responsible for identifying evaluating managing and escalating compliance risks the crmc has a dual reporting relationship directly to both the ermc and the audit and compliance committee we have a comprehensive antimoney laundering program that monitors and reports suspicious activity to the appropriate government authorities as part of that program the global risk oversight team provides independent risk assessment of the rules used by the antimoney laundering team in addition the internal audit group reviews the processes for practices consistent with regulatory guidance reputational risk management process we define reputational risk as the risk that negative stakeholder reaction to our products services client and partner relationships business activities and policies management and workplace culture or our

responsible for ensuring reputational risk considerations are included in the scope of appropriate subordinate risk policies and committees and properly reflected in all decisions escalated to the ermc market risk management process market risk is the risk to earnings or asset and liability values resulting from movements in market prices our market risk exposures include interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk interest rate risk is driven by the relationship between interest rates on assets such as loans receivables and investment securities and interest rates on liabilities such as debt and deposits foreign exchange risk arises from transactions funding investments and earnings in currencies other than the us dollar our risk policies establish the framework that guides and governs market risk management including quantitative limits and escalation triggers these policies are approved by the ermc asset liability committee or market risk management committee market risk is managed by the market risk management committee the market risk oversight officer provides an independent risk assessment and oversight over the policies and exposure management for market risk and asset liability management activities as well as overseeing compliance with associated regulatory requirements market risk management is also guided and governed by policies covering the use of derivative financial instruments funding liquidity and investments interest rate risk we analyze a variety of interest rate scenarios to inform us of the potential impacts from interest rate changes on earnings and the value of assets liabilities and the economic value of equity our interest rate exposure can vary over time as a result of among other things the proportion of our total funding provided by variable and fixedrate debt and deposits compared to our card member loans and receivables interest rate swaps are used from time to time to effectively convert debt issuances to variablerate from fixedrate or vice versa refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our derivative financial instruments in the composition of our balance sheet shifted substantially there was a substantial net reduction in total fixedrate assets within card member loans and card member receivables and an increase in certain floatingrate assets such as cash and cash equivalents as of december a hypothetical immediate basis point increase in market interest rates would have a detrimental impact of approximately million on our annual net interest income a hypothetical immediate basis point decrease in market interest rates which are assumed to remain at or above zero percent would have a smaller but still detrimental impact on our annual net interest income this measure first projects net interest income over the following twelvemonth time horizon considering forecasted business growth and anticipated future market interest rates the detrimental impact from rate changes is then measured by instantaneously increasing or decreasing the anticipated future interest rates by basis points our estimated repricing risk assumes that our interestrate sensitive assets and liabilities that reprice within the twelvemonth horizon generally reprice by the same magnitude as benchmark rate changes it is further assumed that within our interestrate sensitive liabilities certain deposits reprice at lower magnitudes than benchmark rate movements and the magnitude of this repricing in turn depends on among other factors the direction of rate movements these assumptions are consistent with historical deposit repricing experience in the industry and within our own portfolio actual changes in our net interest income will depend on many factors and therefore may differ from our estimated risk to changes in market interest rates libor transition due to uncertainty surrounding the suitability and sustainability of libor central banks and global regulators have called for financial market participants to prepare for the discontinuance of libor and the establishment of alternative reference rates we have financial instruments and commercial agreements that will be impacted by the discontinuance of libor including floating rate debt and equity instruments derivatives borrowings and other contracts we have established an enterprisewide crossfunctional initiative to identify assess and monitor risks associated with libor engage with the industry participants and regulators and to transition to new alternative reference rates as part of this initiative we are updating our operational processes it systems and models for a timely transition see the discontinuance of libor may negatively impact our access to funding and the value of our financial instruments and commercial agreements under risk factors for additional information foreign exchange risk foreign exchange exposures arise in four principal ways card member spending in currencies that are not the billing currency crosscurrency transactions and balances from our funding activities crosscurrency investing activities such as in the equity of foreign subsidiaries and revenues generated and expenses incurred in foreign currencies which impact earnings these foreign exchange risks are managed primarily by entering into foreign exchange spot transactions or hedged with foreign exchange forward contracts when the hedge costs are economically justified and in notional amounts designed to offset pretax impacts from currency movements in the period in which they occur as of december foreign currency derivative instruments with total notional amounts of approximately billion were outstanding with respect to card member spending and crosscurrency transactions including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding the impact of a hypothetical percent strengthening of the us dollar would have been immaterial to projected earnings as of december with respect to translation exposure of foreign subsidiary equity balances including related foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding a hypothetical percent strengthening of the us dollar would result in an immaterial reduction in other comprehensive income and equity as of december with respect to anticipated earnings denominated in foreign currencies for the next twelve months the adverse impact on pretax income of a hypothetical percent strengthening of the us dollar would be approximately million as of december to a much lesser extent we are also subject to market risk arising from activities conducted by our foreign exchange international payments business we aim to minimize market risk from these activities through hedging where appropriate and the establishment of limits the actual impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate changes will depend on among other factors the timing of rate changes the extent to which different rates do not move in the same direction or in the same direction to the same degree changes in the cost volume and mix of our hedging activities and changes in the volume and mix of our businesses funding liquidity risk management process funding and liquidity risk is defined as our inability to meet our ongoing financial and business obligations as they become due at a reasonable cost our boardapproved liquidity risk policy establishes the framework that guides and governs liquidity risk management funding and liquidity risk is managed by the funding and liquidity committee in addition the market risk oversight officer provides independent oversight of liquidity risk management we manage liquidity risk by maintaining access to a diverse set of cash readilymarketable securities and contingent sources of liquidity such that we can continuously meet our business requirements and expected future financing obligations for at least a twelvemonth period in the event we are unable to raise new funds under our regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions we consider the tradeoffs between maintaining too much liquidity which can be costly and limit financial flexibility and having inadequate liquidity which may result in financial distress during a liquidity event funding and liquidity risk is managed at an aggregate consolidated level as well as at certain subsidiaries in order to ensure that sufficient and accessible liquidity resources are maintained the funding and liquidity committee reviews forecasts of our aggregate and subsidiary cash positions and financing requirements approves funding plans designed to satisfy those requirements under normal and stressed conditions establishes guidelines to identify the amount of liquidity resources required and monitors positions and determines any actions to be taken model risk management process we define model risk as the risk of adverse consequences such as financial loss poor business and strategic decision making or damage to our reputation from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports we manage model risk through a comprehensive model governance framework including policies and procedures for model development independent model validation and change management capabilities that seek to minimize erroneous model methodology outputs and misuse we also assess model performance on an ongoing basis we utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning aiml approaches for a variety of business use cases we perform extensive reviews and testing to reduce the risk that these aiml techniques do not perform as intended strategic and business risk management process strategic and business risk is the risk related to our inability to achieve our business objectives due to poor strategic decisions including decisions related to mergers acquisitions and divestitures poor implementation of strategic decisions or declining demand for our products and services strategic decisions are reviewed and approved by business leaders and various committees and must be aligned with company policies we seek to manage strategic and business risks through risk controls embedded in these processes as well as overall risk management oversight over business goals existing product performance is reviewed periodically by committees and business leaders mergers acquisitions and divestitures can only be approved following executive committee due diligence a comprehensive risk assessment by operational market credit and oversight leaders provided to the chief risk officer and approval by either the chief risk officer or appropriate risk committees all new products and material changes in business processes are reviewed and approved by the new products committee and appropriate credit or risk committees country risk management process country risk is defined as the risk that economic social andor political conditions and events in a country might adversely impact us primarily as a result of greater credit losses increased operational or market risk or the inability to repatriate capital we manage country risk as part of the normal course of business policies and procedures establish country risk escalation thresholds to control and limit exposure driven by processes that enable the monitoring of conditions in countries where we have exposure critical accounting estimates refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies certain of our accounting policies requiring significant management assumptions and judgments are as follows reserves for card member credit losses reserves for card member credit losses represent our best estimate of the expected credit losses in our outstanding portfolio of card member loans and receivables as of the balance sheet date the cecl methodology which became effective january requires us to estimate lifetime expected credit losses by incorporating historical loss experience and current and future economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable period rs period beyond the balance sheet date in estimating expected credit losses we use a combination of statistically based models and analysis of the results produced by these models to determine the quantitative and qualitative components of our total balance sheet reserves for credit losses these quantitative and qualitative components entail a significant amount of judgment the primary areas of judgment used in measuring the quantitative components of our reserves relate to the determination of the appropriate rs period the modeling of the probability of and exposure at default and the methodology to incorporate current and future economic conditions we use these models and assumptions combined with historical loss experience to determine the reserve rates that are applied to the outstanding loan or receivable balances to produce our reserves for expected credit losses for the rs period the qualitative component is intended to capture expected losses that may not have been fully captured in the quantitative component through an established governance structure we consider certain external and internal factors including emerging portfolio characteristics and trends which consequentially may increase or decrease the reserves for card member credit losses the rs period which is approximately three years represents the maximum timeperiod beyond the balance sheet date over which we can reasonably estimate expected credit losses using all available portfolio information current economic conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions card member loan products do not have a contractual term and balances can revolve if minimum required payments are made causing some balances to remain outstanding beyond the rs period to determine expected credit losses beyond the rs period we immediately revert to longterm average loss rates card member receivable products are contractually required to be paid in full therefore we have assumed the balances will be either paid or writtenoff within the rs period within the rs period our models use past loss experience and current and future economic conditions to estimate the probability of default exposure at default and expected recoveries to estimate net losses at default a significant area of judgment relates to how we apply future card member payments to the reporting period balances when determining the exposure at default the nature of revolving loan products inherently includes a relationship between future payments and spend behavior which creates complexity in the application of how future payments are either partially or entirely attributable to the existing balance at the end of the reporting period using historical customer behavior and other factors we have assumed that future payments are first allocated to interest and fees associated with the reporting period balance and future spend we then allocate a portion of the payment to the estimated higher minimum payment amount due because of any future spend any remaining portion of the future payment is then allocated to the remaining reporting period balance cecl requires that the rs period include an assumption about current and future economic conditions we incorporate multiple macroeconomic scenarios obtained from an independent third party the estimated credit losses calculated from each macroeconomic scenario are reviewed and weighted to reflect managements judgment about uncertainty around the scenarios these macroeconomic scenarios contain certain variables including unemployment rates and real gdp that are significant to our models macroeconomic sensitivity to demonstrate the sensitivity of estimated credit losses to the macroeconomic scenarios we compared our modeled estimates under a baseline scenario to that under a pessimistic downside scenario for every percentage points change in weighting from the baseline scenario to the pessimistic downside scenario the estimated credit losses increased by approximately million the modeled estimates under these scenarios were influenced by the duration severity and timing of changes in economic variables within each scenario and these macroeconomic scenarios under different conditions or using different assumptions could result in significantly different estimated credit losses it is difficult to estimate how potential changes in specific factors might affect the estimated credit losses and current results may not be indicative of the potential future impact of macroeconomic forecast changes in addition this sensitivity analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimates under two scenarios without considering managements judgment on the relative weighting for those and other scenarios including the weight that has been placed on downside scenarios at the balance sheet date or any potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative reserve component or the impact of management judgment for the qualitative reserve component which may have a positive or negative effect on the results thus the results of this sensitivity analysis are hypothetical and are not intended to estimate or reflect our expectations of any changes in the overall reserves for credit losses due to changes in the macroeconomic environment the following table reflects the range of key variables in the macroeconomic scenarios utilized for the computation of reserves for card member credit losses as of december table start december us unemployment rate fourth quarter of first quarter of fourth quarter of fourth quarter of us gdp growth contraction a fourth quarter of first quarter of fourth quarter of fourth quarter of table end a real gdp quarter over quarter percentage change seasonally adjusted to annualized rates refer to business environment and table in mda and note and note to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of the impact of cecl both at implementation and for the year ended december the process of estimating these reserves requires a high degree of judgment to the extent our expected credit loss models are not indicative of future performance actual losses could differ significantly from our judgments and expectations resulting in either higher or lower future provisions for credit losses in any period liability for membership rewards the membership rewards program is our largest cardbased rewards program card members can earn points for purchases charged on their enrolled card products a significant portion of our cards by their terms allow card members to earn bonus points for purchases at merchants in particular industry categories membership rewards points are redeemable for a broad variety of rewards including travel shopping gift cards and covering eligible charges points typically do not expire and there is no limit on the number of points a card member may earn membership rewards expense is driven by charge volume on enrolled cards customer participation in the program and contractual arrangements with redemption partners we record a membership rewards liability that represents the estimated cost of points earned that are expected to be redeemed by card members in the future the membership rewards liability is impacted over time by enrollment levels attrition the volume of points earned and redeemed and the associated redemption costs we estimate the membership rewards liability by determining the urr and the wac per point which are applied to the points of current enrollees refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information the urr assumption is used to estimate the number of points earned by current enrollees that will ultimately be redeemed in future periods we use statistical and actuarial models to estimate the urr of points earned to date by current card members based on redemption trends card product type enrollment tenure card spend levels and credit attributes the wac per point assumption is used to estimate future redemption costs and is primarily based on redemption choices made by card members reward offerings by partners and membership rewards program changes the wac per point assumption is derived from months of redemptions and is adjusted as appropriate for certain changes in redemption costs that are not representative of future cost expectations and expected developments in redemption patterns we periodically evaluate our liability estimation process and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns cost per point redeemed partner contract changes and other factors the process of estimating the membership rewards liability includes a high degree of judgment actual redemptions and associated redemption costs could differ significantly from our estimates resulting in either higher or lower membership rewards expense changes in the membership rewards urr and wac per point have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the liability through the current period membership rewards expense by an amount estimated to cover the cost of all points previously earned but not yet redeemed by current enrollees as of the end of the reporting period as of december an increase in the estimated urr of current enrollees of basis points would increase the membership rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately million similarly an increase in the wac per point of basis point would increase the membership rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately million goodwill recoverability goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost of an acquired business over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or when events or circumstances arise such as adverse changes in the business climate that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value our methodology for conducting this goodwill impairment testing contains both a qualitative and quantitative assessment we have the option to initially perform an assessment of qualitative factors in order to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the qualitative factors may include but are not limited to economic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors overall financial performance of the reporting unit and other company and reporting unitspecific events if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we then perform the impairment evaluation using a more detailed quantitative assessment we could also directly perform this quantitative assessment for any reporting unit bypassing the qualitative assessment our methodology for conducting the quantitative goodwill impairment testing is fundamentally based on the measurement of fair value for our reporting units which inherently entails the use of significant management judgment for valuation we use a combination of the income approach discounted cash flows and market approach market multiples in estimating the fair value of our reporting units when preparing discounted cash flow models under the income approach we estimate future cash flows using the reporting units internal multiyear forecast and a terminal value calculated using a growth rate that we believe is appropriate in light of current and expected future economic conditions to discount these cash flows we use our expected cost of equity determined using a capital asset pricing model when using the market method under the market approach we apply comparable publicly traded companies multiples eg earnings revenues to our reporting units actual results the judgment in estimating forecasted cash flows discount rates and market comparables is significant and imprecision could materially affect the fair value of our reporting units we could be exposed to an increased risk of further goodwill impairment if future operating results or macroeconomic conditions differ significantly from managements current assumptions income taxes we are subject to the income tax laws of the united states its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate these tax laws are complex and the manner in which they apply to the taxpayers facts is sometimes open to interpretation in establishing a provision for income tax expense we must make judgments about the application of inherently complex tax laws unrecognized tax benefits we establish a liability for unrecognized tax benefits which are the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit recognized in the financial statements in establishing a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit assumptions may be made in determining whether and the extent to which a tax position should be sustained a tax position is recognized only when it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority based on its technical merits the amount of tax benefit recognized is the largest benefit that we believe is more likely than not to be realized on ultimate settlement as new information becomes available we evaluate our tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits as appropriate tax benefits ultimately realized can differ from amounts previously recognized due to uncertainties with any such differences generally impacting the provision for income tax deferred tax asset realization deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse since deferred taxes measure the future tax effects of items recognized in the consolidated financial statements certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized in making this assessment we analyze and estimate the impact of future taxable income reversing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies these assessments are performed quarterly taking into account any new information changes in facts or circumstances can lead to changes in the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets due to uncertainties other matters recently issued accounting standards refer to the recently issued and adopted accounting standards section of note to the consolidated financial statements glossary of selected terminology adjusted net interest income a nongaap measure that represents net interest income attributable to our card member loans which includes on a gaap basis interest that is deemed uncollectible excluding the impact of interest expense and interest income not attributable to our card member loans airlinerelated volume represents spend at airlines as a merchant asset securitizations asset securitization involves the transfer and sale of loans or receivables to a specialpurpose entity created for the securitization activity typically a trust the trust in turn issues securities commonly referred to as assetbacked securities that are secured by the transferred loans and receivables the trust uses the proceeds from the sale of such securities to pay the purchase price for the transferred loans or receivables the securitized loans and receivables of our lending trust and charge trust collectively the trusts are reported as assets and the securities issued by the trusts are reported as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets average discount rate this calculation is generally designed to reflect the average pricing at all merchants accepting american express cards and represents the percentage of proprietary and gns billed business retained by us from merchants we acquire or from merchants acquired by third parties on our behalf net of amounts retained by such third parties the average discount rate together with billed business drive our discount revenue billed business represents transaction volumes including cash advances on cards and other payment products issued by american express proprietary billed business and cards issued under network partnership agreements with banks and other institutions including joint ventures gns billed business instore spending activity within gns retail cobrand portfolios from which we earn no revenue is

issued american expressbranded card card member loans represents the outstanding amount due from card members for charges made on their american express credit cards as well as any interest charges and cardrelated fees card member loans also include revolving balances on certain american express charge card products card member receivables represents the outstanding amount due from card members for charges made on their american express charge cards as well as any cardrelated fees other than revolving balances on certain american express charge cards with pay over time features such revolving balances are included within card member loans charge cards represents cards that generally carry no preset spending limits and are primarily designed as a method of payment and not as a means of financing purchases charge card members generally must pay the full amount billed each month no finance charges are assessed on charge cards each charge card transaction is authorized based on its likely economics reflecting a card members most recent credit information and spend patterns some charge cards have additional pay over time features that allow revolving of certain charges cobrand cards cards issued under cobrand agreements with selected commercial partners pursuant to the cobrand agreements we make payments to our cobrand partners which can be significant based primarily on the amount of card member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and under certain arrangements on the number of accounts acquired and retained the partner is then liable for providing rewards to the card member under the cobrand partners own loyalty program credit cards represents cards that have a range of revolving payment terms grace periods and rate and fee structures discount revenue primarily represents the amount earned on transactions occurring at merchants that have entered into a card acceptance agreement with us a gns partner or other thirdparty merchant acquirer for facilitating transactions between the merchants and card members interest expense includes interest incurred primarily to fund card member loans and receivables general corporate purposes and liquidity needs interest expense is divided principally into two categories i deposits which primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken from customers and institutions and ii debt which primarily relates to interest expense on our longterm financing and shortterm borrowings eg commercial paper federal funds purchased bank overdrafts and other shortterm borrowings as well as the realized impact of derivatives hedging interest rate risk on our longterm debt interest income includes i interest on loans ii interest and dividends on investment securities and iii interest income on deposits with banks and other interest on loans assessed using the average daily balance method for card member loans unless the loan is classified as nonaccrual interest is recognized based upon the principal amount outstanding in accordance with the terms of the applicable account agreement until the outstanding balance is paid or written off interest and dividends on investment securities primarily relates to our performing fixedincome securities interest income is recognized using the effective interest method which adjusts the yield for security premiums and discounts fees and other payments so a constant rate of return is recognized on the outstanding balance of the related investment security throughout its term amounts are recognized until securities are in default or when it is likely that future interest payments will not be made as scheduled interest income on deposits with banks and other primarily relates to the placement of cash in excess of nearterm funding requirements in interestbearing time deposits overnight sweep accounts and other interestbearing demand and call accounts loyalty coalitions programs that enable consumers to earn rewards points and use them to save on purchases from a variety of participating merchants through multicategory rewards platforms merchants in these programs generally fund the consumer offers and are responsible to us for the cost of rewards points we earn revenue from operating the loyalty platform and by providing marketing support net card fees represents the card membership fees earned during the period recognized as revenue over the covered card membership period typically one year net of the provision for projected refunds for card membership cancellation and deferred acquisition costs net interest yield on average card member loans a nongaap measure that is computed by dividing adjusted net interest income by average card member loans computed on an annualized basis reserves and net writeoffs related to uncollectible interest are recorded through provision for credit losses and are thus not included in the net interest yield calculation net writeoff rate principal only represents the amount of proprietary consumer or small business card member loans or receivables written off consisting of principal resulting from authorized transactions less recoveries as a percentage of the average loan or receivable balance during the period net writeoff rate principal interest and fees includes in the calculation of the net writeoff rate amounts for interest and fees

losses as a result of among other things changes in volumes macroeconomic outlook portfolio composition and credit quality of portfolios reserve build represents the amount by which the provision for credit losses exceeds net writeoffs while reserve release represents the amount by which net writeoffs exceed the provision for credit losses return on average equity calculated by dividing oneyear period net income by oneyear average total shareholders equity terelated volume represents spend on travel and entertainment which primarily includes airline cruise lodging and dining merchant categories nonterelated volume includes spend in all other merchant categories cautionary note regarding forwardlooking statements this report includes forwardlooking statements within the meaning of

statements factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to the following our ability to rebuild growth momentum and improve our financial performance to prepandemic levels which will depend in part on a recovery in consumer travel and therefore on how soon lockdowns ease travel restrictions lift and the general public begins to feel comfortable traveling again discount revenue recovering broadly inline with billed business credit performance and reserve levels identifying attractive investment opportunities that help rebuild growth momentum product innovation and the pace at which we wind down our value injection efforts our ability to control operating expenses and generate operating expense leverage

in the subsequent paragraphs our ability to grow billed business revenues and eps which could be impacted by among other things uncertainty regarding the continued spread of covid19 including new variants and severity of the pandemic and the availability distribution and use of effective treatments and vaccines a further deterioration in global economic and business conditions consumer and business spending not growing in line with expectations including te spending not rebounding to levels by the end of an inability or unwillingness of card members to pay amounts owed to us insufficient governmental stimulus and relief programs to address the ongoing impact of the pandemic prolonged measures to contain the spread of covid19 including travel restrictions or premature easing of such containment measures both of which could further exacerbate the effects on business activity and our card members partners and merchants health concerns associated with the pandemic

rates macroeconomic factors such as unemployment rates gdp and the volume of bankruptcies the impact of the cecl methodology collections capabilities and recoveries of previously writtenoff loans and receivables the enrollment in and effectiveness of hardship programs and troubled debt restructurings the availability of government stimulus programs for borrowers and governmental actions that provide forms of relief with respect to certain loans and fees such as limiting debt collections efforts and encouraging or requiring extensions modifications or forbearance net interest income and the growth rate of loans outstanding being higher or lower than current expectations which will depend on the behavior of card members and their actual spending and borrowing patterns our ability to effectively manage risk and enhance card member value propositions changes in interest rates and our cost of funds credit actions including line size and other adjustments to credit availability and the effectiveness of our strategies to capture a greater share of existing card members spending and borrowings reduce card member attrition and attract new customers the actual amount we spend on marketing in the future which will be based in part on continued changes in macroeconomic conditions and business performance managements identification and assessment of attractive investment opportunities and the receptivity of card members and prospective customers to advertising and customer acquisition initiatives the pace at which we wind down our value injections efforts our ability to balance expense control and investments in the business and managements ability to realize efficiencies and optimize investment spending the actual amount to be spent on card member rewards and services and business development and the relationship of these variable customer engagement costs to revenues which could be impacted by continued changes in macroeconomic conditions and card member behavior as it relates to their spending patterns including the level of spend in bonus categories and the redemption of rewards and offers including travel redemptions the costs related to reward point redemptions card members interest in the value propositions we offer further enhancements to product benefits to make them attractive to card members potentially in a manner that is not costeffective and new and renegotiated contractual obligations with business partners our ability to control our operating expenses and the actual amount we spend on operating expenses in the future which could be impacted by among other things managements decision to increase or decrease spending in such areas as technology business and product development sales force premium servicing and digital capabilities depending on overall business performance our ability to innovate efficient channels of customer interactions such as chat supported by artificial intelligence restructuring activity fraud costs information security or compliance expenses or consulting legal and other professional services fees including as a result of litigation or internal and regulatory reviews the

among other things the further deterioration in macroeconomic conditions impacting the ability and desire of card members to pay card fees higher card member attrition rates card members continuing to be attracted to our premium card products and the pace of card member acquisition activity and our inability to address competitive pressures and implement our strategies and business initiatives including introducing new and enhanced benefits and services that are designed for the current environment a further decline of the average discount rate including as a result of further changes in the mix of spending by location and industry including the pace of recovery in te spending merchant negotiations including merchant incentives concessions and volumerelated pricing discounts competition pricing regulation including regulation of competitors interchange rates and other factors our tax rate not remaining consistent with current expectations which could be impacted by among other things our geographic mix of income further changes in tax laws and regulation unfavorable tax audits and other unanticipated tax items changes in the substantial and increasing worldwide competition in the payments industry including competitive pressure that may materially impact the prices charged to merchants that accept american express cards competition for new and existing cobrand relationships competition from new and nontraditional competitors and the success of marketing promotion and rewards programs changes affecting our plans regarding the return of capital to shareholders including resuming our share repurchases in the first quarter of which will depend on factors such as capital levels and regulatory capital ratios changes in the stress testing and capital planning process our results of operations and financial condition our credit ratings and rating agency considerations and the economic environment and market conditions in any given period our ability to increase card member acquisition activities provide additional value to card members and refresh our premium products which will be impacted in part by competition brand perceptions and reputation and our ability to develop and market value propositions that appeal to card members and new customers and offer attractive services and rewards programs which will depend in part on ongoing investments in card member acquisition efforts addressing changing customer behaviors new product innovation and development and enrollment processes including through digital channels and infrastructure to support new products services and benefits our ability to grow commercial payments including through cash flow and supplier payment solutions which will depend in part on competition the willingness and ability of companies to use such solutions for procurement and other business expenditures our ability to offer attractive value propositions to potential customers our ability to enhance and expand our payment and lending solutions and our ability to integrate kabbage and relaunch its suite of products our ability to innovate and strengthen our global network which will depend in part on our ability to update our systems and platforms the amount we invests in the network and our ability to make funds available for such investments and technological developments including capabilities that allow greater digital integration the possibility that we will not execute on our plans to expand merchant coverage and improve perceptions of coverage which will depend in part on the success of the company optblue merchant acquirers and gns partners in signing merchants to accept american express which could be impacted by our value propositions offered to merchants and merchant acquirers for card acceptance as well as the awareness and willingness of card members to use american express cards at merchants and whether card members experience welcome acceptance for american express cards our ability to introduce new and expanded digital capabilities which will depend on our success in evolving our products and processes for the digital environment developing new features in the amex app and enhancing our digital channels building partnerships and executing programs with other companies effectively utilizing artificial intelligence to address servicing and other customer needs and supporting the use of our products as a means of payment through online and mobile channels all of which will be impacted by investment levels new product innovation and

liquidity needs and expectations regarding capital ratios our access to capital and funding costs the valuation of our assets and our credit ratings or those of our subsidiaries our deposit rates increasing faster or slower than current expectations and changes affecting our ability to grow retail direct deposits including due to market demand changes in benchmark interest rates competition or regulatory restrictions on our ability to obtain deposit funding or offer competitive interest rates which could affect our net interest yield and ability to fund our businesses our funding plan being
